''Fire-Brigade'' is a turn-based strategic and tactical wargame that allows players flexibility and advanced functions. The player can play either alone against the [[AI]] or against another person in any of four scenarios networked via modem or cable. The player can play either as the [[Germans]] or the [[Soviet Union]] in any of the scenarios. At their command is a comprehensive reporting system and realistic staff support.

Players can set combat, logistics and air commitment support values to direct the allocation of supplies; reinforcements and combat support assets. Gather intelligence on enemy forces and assess information on friendly forces before issuing movement and attack orders to units in either a micro (individual units) or macro level (subordinate headquarters). You can then set the frontage of your unit's formation to either narrow, medium or broad, all while you 'confer' with the games' AI which will use [[artificial intelligence]] routines to execute the orders within set variable parameters such as morale, troop quality, fatigue etc.<ref>O'Connor, David (1988), pp.4-77, ''Fire Brigade Player Manual'', [[Panther Games]], Retrieved 2013-04-15</ref>
