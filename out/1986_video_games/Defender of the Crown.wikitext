'''''Defender of the Crown''''' is a [[strategy game|strategy]] [[video game]] designed by Kellyn Beeck. It was [[Cinemaware]]'s first game, and was originally released for the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] in 1986, setting a new standard for graphic quality in [[home computer]] games.

In 1987 it was ported to [[MS-DOS]], the [[Atari ST]] and the [[Macintosh]] and a conversion was done for the [[Commodore 64]]. Later it was ported to the [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]], [[CD-i]] and [[Atari Jaguar]] and conversions were made for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]] and [[Intellivision]]. Unofficially a [[ZX Spectrum]] version was also made. A sequel, ''Defender of the Crown II'', was released in 1993 for the CDTV and [[Amiga CD32]]. Two remakes have been released: ''[[Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown]]'' in 2003 and ''Defender of the Crown: Heroes Live Forever'' in 2007.

==Gameplay==
The game is set in England in 1149 during the [[Middle Ages]] where, following the death of the king, different factions are fighting for territorial control.

[[File:ST Defender of the Crown fight.png|thumb|left|The fighting screen was one of the features added to the [[Atari ST]] version]]

The player assumes the role of a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] (Wilfred of [[Ivanhoe]], Cedric of Rotherwood, Geoffrey Longsword, or Wolfric the Wild) and tries to fight off the [[Normans|Norman]] hordes and wrestle for control of England. Eventually, the player must fight for control of all territories, and potentially those controlled by other Saxons, if they have become antagonistic. The player must amass armies and fight for control of opponents' [[castle]]s. The player may engage enemy armies in battle and loot or lay siege to opposing castles. Territories can also be won in the periodic [[jousting]] contests. From time to time the player may attempt to rescue a [[damsel in distress]] and can appeal for help from the legendary bandit [[Robin Hood]].

The game's strategy boils down to a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] as the player tries to amass larger armies than their opponents and manages to attack their territories at the right time.

Due to financial strains, Cinemaware decided to release the initial version without all the features originally planned for because of their need for revenue. Some features were partially implemented, but were removed so the game could be shipped. Some additional features completed but never seen in the shipped game include flaming fireballs (launched via the [[catapult]]), more locations (more varied castles to attack), and more in-depth strategy. Some of these features were implemented in later versions of the game.

[[James D. Sachs]], the primary [[Game art design|artist]] for the game, showcased some of these features on the Amiga during interviews after the release of the game.

==Cover art==
The cover art of ''Defender of the Crown'' was put together by Peter Green Design and painted by Ezra Tucker.

Randy McDonald was in charge of art direction, design, and production for Cinemaware's first four games, and he explains in an interview that "Peter Greene or I would do a sketch of generally what we wanted for each cover. I went to Western Costume in Hollywood, which for many decades was the giant in the costume industry there, and rented costumes for the types of "look" we had settled on for each cover. We hired models and brought them into Peter's large photo studio, where we set them up in the costumes I had rented, posed as closely as possible to the way we wanted them to be illustrated."<ref>[http://spelpappan.se/2013/08/this-is-how-the-cover-art-of-defender-of-the-crown-1986-was-made/ This is how the cover art in Defender of the Crown was made] - Spelpappan.se</ref>

The initial artist, according to Randy McDonald, was supposed to be Greg Winter, but the cover eventually went to Ezra Tucker.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

==Versions==
The versions of ''Defender of the Crown'', notably for [[DOS]] and the NES, resulted in an enormous loss in graphic and audio quality due to those systems' inferior abilities compared to the Amiga. But these versions featured more in-depth strategic elements compared to the [[unfinished work|unfinished]]  original version. The Apple II<small>GS</small>, Atari ST, and Commodore 64 versions were done with better success, the II<small>GS</small>, Macintosh, and ST versions' graphics coming quite close to the Amiga version. A version for the [[Sharp X68000]] was in development by [[Bullet-Proof Software]] but never released.<ref name="BPS">{{cite web|url=http://jester.dw.land.to/bps.htm|title=ＢＰＳの話|website=jester.dw.land.to|access-date=2020-04-01|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824170232/http://jester.dw.land.to/bps.htm|archive-date=2016-08-24|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1989, the game became the second game to ship on [[CD-ROM]], after ''[[The Manhole]]''.<ref name="sipe199211">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100 | title=3900 Games Later ... | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1992 | access-date=4 July 2014 | author=Sipe, Russell | pages=8}}</ref>

==Reception==
The first public demonstration of ''Defender of the Crown'' occurred at the Los Angeles Commodore Show in September 1986, before its November release, and attracted a huge crowd.{{r|maher20150416}} The game amazed those who saw it for the first time:<ref>[http://worldcat.org/isbn/0973864907 ''On the edge : the spectacular rise and fall of Commodore''] from WorldCat.org</ref>

{{blockquote|[[RJ Mical|Mical]] saw artist Jim Sachs push the Amiga to its full potential. "Jim Sachs, what a god he is," marvels Mical. "Jim Sachs is amazing. These days everyone sees graphics like that because there are a lot of really good computer graphics artists now, but back then, 20 years ago, it was astonishing to have someone that good."

The final game was a landmark in video game production values. As game designer Bob Lindstrom recalls, "The shock of seeing ''Defender'' for the first time was one of those experiences that changed the gaming stakes for all of us."

Compared to other video games of the time, ''Defender of the Crown'' established a new level of quality. IBM had ''[[King's Quest I|Kings Quest]]'' by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]], a decent but primitive adventure game. The Macintosh had games like Checkers or Backgammon, or board games like ''Risk''. ''Defender of the Crown'' had richer graphics than any computer, console, or even arcade game could boast in 1986. It was a revelation.}}

''Defender of the Crown'' became a commercial hit. In 1989, ''[[Video Games & Computer Entertainment]]'' reported that it had been purchased by "almost three-quarters of a million gamers worldwide".<ref name=megahits>{{cite journal | author=Worley, Joyce | title=Mega Hits: The Best of the Best | journal=[[Video Games & Computer Entertainment]] | date=December 1989 | pages=130–132, 137, 138 }}</ref> Sales had surpassed 1 million units by 2001.<ref name=pczonepreview>{{cite journal| title=Cinemaware Return from the Dead | author=Hill, Mark | journal=[[PC Zone]] | date=January 2001 | issue=98 | page=30 }}</ref>

''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'' gave the Amiga version four stars out of five, stating that its "graphics have set new standards for computer games". The magazine praised the "breathtaking" animation and "impressive" color, but hoped that future Cinemaware games would improve on the "adequate" gameplay, which was "the weak link".<ref name="info198701amiga">{{Cite magazine |last1=Dunnington |first1=Benn |last2=Brown |first2=Mark R. |last3=Malcolm |first3=Tom |date=January–February 1987 |title=Amiga Gallery |url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n89/mode/2up |magazine=Info |pages=90–95}}</ref> ''The Australian Commodore Review'' gave the Commodore 64 version of the game a total score of 96 out of 100,<ref>Gordon, Stephen; Watts, Shane (February 1987), [http://amr.abime.net/review_15143 "Defender of the Crown - page scan at Amiga Magazine Rack], issue 2, accessed December 18, 2012</ref> while ''[[Commodore User]]'' said that it was "totally brilliant and one of the best games to date on the 64."<ref>Patterson, Mark (August 1987) [http://amr.abime.net/review_12453 "Defender of the Crown" - page scan at Amiga Magazine Rack], accessed December 18, 2012.</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised the Amiga version of ''Defender of the Crown'''s graphics and animation, calling the game "a showcase program to demonstrate the power of the Amiga to your friends."

==Legacy==
''Defender of the Crown II'' was published by [[Commodore International]] in 1993 for the [[CDTV]] and [[Amiga CD32]].

After a string of successful games and game series, Cinemaware eventually went [[bankrupt]]. In 2000, however, Lars Fuhrken-Batista and Sean Vesce bought Cinemaware's name and assets, and founded Cinemaware Inc., naming a remake of ''Defender of the Crown'' for modern PCs as one of the reformed company's first projects. The new version, titled ''[[Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown]]'' was released in 2003 for the [[PlayStation 2]] (September 30), [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] (October 6), and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (October 15). The new company also created "Digitally Remastered Versions" of classic Cinemaware games, including ''Defender of the Crown''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

In February 2007, a second remake to the game called ''Defender of the Crown: Heroes Live Forever'' was released by [[eGames (video game developer)|eGames]],<ref>[http://www.egames.com/gamepage.php?id=60 ''Defender of the Crown: Heroes Live Forever] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405184441/http://www.egames.com/gamepage.php?id=60 |date=2008-04-05 }} from [[eGames (video game developer)|eGames]]</ref> who had acquired Cinemaware in 2005. ''Heroes Live Forever'' features many of the elements of the original game, including jousting and archery tournaments, raiding castles, rescuing princesses, and laying siege to enemy fortresses via catapult. A new addition to the game involved the use of Hero and Tactic cards during battles, giving the user's army various upgrades during the on-screen melee.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

During the second half of the 1980s, some games directly inspired by ''Defender of the Crown'' were released. Among these was for example ''Joan of Arc'' ([[Rainbow Arts]], 1989).

The [[Denmark|Danish]] band [[PRESS PLAY ON TAPE]] remixed the theme music of the game on their 2003 album ''Run/Stop Restore'', replacing the instrumental tune with proper medieval-sounding lyrics.<ref name="ppot">{{cite web|title=CDs|url=http://pressplayontape.com/music/cds/|website=Press Play On Tape|access-date=7 May 2018}}</ref>
