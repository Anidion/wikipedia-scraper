''Video Games and Computer Entertainment'' critic, Donn Nauert, praised the game's sound, graphics, and playability, giving it an overall score of 9 out of 10.<ref name="VGCE"/> Commenting on the game's unsolved rape, Nauert wrote: "I don't think this is a subject that the American public is comfortable with in a video game, even though it's not dealt with graphically..."<ref name="VGCE"/> Defunct Games stated: "This is the type of game that will no doubt appeal to the gamers who love a good murder mystery, and while it's not perfect there's no denying that it's the best game of its kind. This is the type of game you don't see much anymore, which is a real shame because for what it is J.B Harold is a lot of fun". They gave the game a score of 70%.<ref name="Defunct"/>

The PC Engine version was rated 21.74 out of 30 by ''[[PC Engine Fan]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Adventure Game |journal=[[PC Engine Fan]] |issue=PC Engine All Catalog '92: PC Engine Fan Appendix |date=August 1992 |lang=ja |pages=49-57 (52-3) |url=https://archive.org/details/pc-engine-all-catalog-92-pc-engine-fan-appendix-august-1992/PC%20Engine%20All%20Catalog%20%2792%20-%20PC%20Engine%20Fan%20Appendix%20%28August%201992%29/page/52/mode/2up}}</ref>

[[GameSpot]] included the game in its list of titles that deserve an [[enhanced remake]], stating that it was "one of the most difficult games ever made", had "some of the most memorable voice acting of all time", and that "to this day there isn't much out there quite like it". They compared it to more recent titles such as the adventure games ''[[Shenmue (video game)|Shenmue]]'' (1999) and ''[[Shadow of Memories]]'' (2001) as well as the [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (video game)|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' (2003), saying that it similarly features "character interaction as the major gameplay element" and has "a similar type of [[Dialog tree|multiple phrase]] response".<ref>{{citation|author=Ryan Mac Donald & Tim Tracy|title=J.B.
