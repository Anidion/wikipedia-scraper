Work on ''Laser Hawk'' started in 1985 and took about a year to complete.<ref name="atimes">{{cite web|last1=Kong Tin |first1=Harvey A. |title=Thanks Andy, for Laser Hawk |url=http://www.ataritimes.com:80/8-bit/features/laserhawk.html |website=The Atari Times |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404001241/http://www.ataritimes.com/8-bit/features/laserhawk.html |archivedate=4 April 2005 }}</ref>  
''Laser Hawk'' was originally called ''Hot Copter'' by Bradfield. Red Rat Software came up with the name ''Laser Hawk.''<ref name="atimes"/>

==Reception==
A review of ''Laser Hawk'' in the January 1987 issue of ''[[Atari User]]'' concluded, "While the game concept is perhaps getting a little long in the tooth, Red Rat has tweaked it nicely, treating it in a thoughtful and refreshing way. What it may lack in originality it makes up for in finesse." The overall score was 8 out of 10.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reynolds|first1=Niels|title=Rat's Flying High|journal=Atari User|date=January 1987|url=https://archive.org/stream/atari-user-uk-magazine-21/Atari_User_UK_21#page/n21/mode/2up|issue=21|page=22}}</ref>
