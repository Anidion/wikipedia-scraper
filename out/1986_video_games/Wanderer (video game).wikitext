== Plot ==
Set in a future where cats have become very valuable, the protagonist's cat has been kidnapped and the kidnapper is asking for an 8000 cat ransom. The player has to visit planets, barter cats, and play a card game to win cats. Visiting new planets engages a straight action sequence of shooting all enemy ships.

== Reception ==
''[[The Games Machine]]'' felt that gameplay was slow and repetitious, and relied too heavily on an average 3D effect.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-18|title=The Games Machine Issue 18}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' felt the overused 3D effect didn't make up for the vacuous gameplay.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-091|title=CVG Magazine Issue 091|date=May 1989}}</ref> ''[[ZZap!64]]'' criticised the boring gameplay and underused 3D.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-048|title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 048|date=April 1989}}</ref>
