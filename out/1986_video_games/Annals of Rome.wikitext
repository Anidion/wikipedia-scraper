'''''Annals of Rome''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Personal Software Services]]. It was first released in the United Kingdom for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Atari ST]] in 1986. It was then released in Germany for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amiga]] in 1987 and 1988, respectively. The game is set in the [[Later Roman Empire|Late Roman Empire]], with the objective being to survive for as long as possible against rebelling European states.

The game is played in two windows. The first is the troops movement window, which allows the player to control the placement of troops in the [[Roman Empire|Roman state]] or to attack computer players. This window shows the number of forces for all players, [[inflation]], popularity and national score of the [[Roman Republic|Roman state]], and human player score. The last step for the player in this window is to set the tax rate, between 1.0 and 2.0% (higher taxes cause higher inflation). In the next window, the player decides which of the 21 Senate members will receive command of the various Roman armies. To help the player in making this decision, all [[Roman Senate|Senate]] members are listed with numbers, the first two indicating their military ability and loyalty, respectively. The last number indicates their age. If the government's [[popularity]] falls below 2 (popularity is measured within a range between -5 and +5), armies with disloyal commanders can revolt and try to take Rome. If this happens before 50 BC, the successful rebel will be declared [[dictator]], and if this happens after, he will become [[emperor]], which will lead to a dynasty.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave the game a positive review, noting innovative mechanics such as the variable turn length. The review noted that the game felt unfinished and unpolished, citing the lack of victory conditions and poor save mechanism.<ref name="CGW">{{citation|date = April 1989|last=Brooks|first=M.
