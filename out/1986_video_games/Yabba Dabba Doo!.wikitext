'''''Yabba Dabba Doo!''''' is a 1986 video game developed by British studio Taskset and published by [[Quicksilva]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] (C64), and [[ZX Spectrum]].<ref name=Crash/><ref name=CG1/><ref>{{cite web |title=Back to the Eighties: The Latest News from January 1986 |url=https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue016-020/Retro_Gamer_Issue_020#page/n17/mode/2up/ |website=[[Retro Gamer]] |date=January 2006 |access-date=May 14, 2019 |page=18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Yabba Dabba Doo! advertisement |url=https://archive.org/details/amtix-magazine-03/page/n47 |website=[[Amtix]] |access-date=May 14, 2019 |date=January 1986 |page=49}}</ref> It is based on the television series ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and is the first [[List of The Flintstones media#Video games|''Flintstones'' video game]].<ref name=SU/>

==Gameplay==
''Yabba Dabba Doo!'' is set before the marriage of [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Wilma Flintstone]], during a time when the city of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] was beginning to take shape.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=Zap/> Playing as Fred, the player's goal is to build a house and persuade Wilma to move in with Fred, leading to their marriage. The player begins with a plot of land that is covered in small rocks, which must be carried off one at a time and dumped into a nearby pit. Enemies include [[pterodactyls]] that try to drop rocks on Fred's head, and turtles and dinosaurs which harm Fred directly. After clearing the rocks from the land, the player then searches Bedrock for boulders, which are used to build the house. Once the house is ready for a roof to be added, the player must get a job at a [[quarry]] in order to raise money to hire a dinosaur service, which will allow Fred to reach the top of the house. Throughout the game, Fred must meet with Wilma whenever he comes across her, in order to fill a heart meter which demonstrates her love for him. When the house is complete, the player must find Wilma and get her to follow Fred to the new house, which she will only do if the heart meter is full. Kissing Wilma is also the player's only way to refill the [[health bar]].<ref name=Crash/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YS/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=CG1/><ref name=ZXC/>

Bedrock is represented through various screens. The player can move left and right to maneuver between screens located along the same path. Accessing upper and lower screens is done by moving diagonally towards the corner edge of each screen, rather than walking straight up or down. Located within Bedrock is Fred's car, which provides faster transportation between screens if it is found by the player. Buildings in Bedrock include a service station, a burger bar, a drive-in movie theater, and a health club, with the latter three locations being popular hangouts for Wilma. Fred's neighbors are building their own houses, and the player earns bonus points if Fred's house is finished before the others.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YS/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=CG1/><ref name=ZXC/>

''[[Computer Gamer]]'', in its review of the C64 version, praised the game's concept but considered the enemies too aggressive.
