This video game is a two-player, drag racing program with timing accuracy to one thousandth of a second. This simulation of professional drag racing included five classes of [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]] competition, including [[Top fuel dragster|Top Fuel Dragsters]], [[Top Alcohol Dragster]]s, Top Fuel Funny Cars, [[Top Alcohol Funny Car]]s, and [[Pro Stock]]. Race against the computer or another player. The timing system used a .400 Pro Tree with reported reaction times, elapsed times, and vehicle miles per hour. The outcome of every race was determined by the driver, not random data. Supported [[joystick]]s and [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] for input.

Drag Race Eliminator was ported over to the [[IBM PC]] and [[IBM PC compatible|compatibles]] in 1987 and became one of the longest selling racing games in the history of personal computers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}.
