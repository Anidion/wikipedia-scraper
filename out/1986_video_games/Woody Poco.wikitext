==Summary==
The player controls an old [[wood]]en figure named "Poco."

He is a hero who has lived in harmony with [[human]]s for many years. For Poco, the journey is to find the [[fairy]] who teaches people to get back to being friendly with wooden dolls. Enemies encountered through the game are strange [[wikt:creature|creatures]] and bothersome old [[men]]. The player attacks by using his [[wikt:fist|fist]]s at them.<ref name="sqpat">{{cite web | url = http://sqpat.com/trans/woodypoko/poko.html | title = Basic overview | publisher = SQ Pat | date = | accessdate = 2011-05-20}}</ref> Players can steal the items in the store.  But after stealing, the player's appearance is changed to resemble that of a [[theft|thief]]. [[Hotel]]s and [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]]s can no longer admit the player for the remainder of the game after a theft has taken place.

The player can equip one hand with a weapon, and the other with a passive tool, such as a lamp for dark areas. The player can buy gear, sleep at hotels, gamble, steal, and bribe [[non-player character]]s. The player needs to eat to prevent hunger, with [[Health regeneration|recharging health]] based on food level. It features an in-game clock, with day/night cycles and four seasons; the color changes to reflect the time of day and the season.<ref name="untold"/>
