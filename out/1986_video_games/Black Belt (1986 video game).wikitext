'''''Black Belt''''' is a [[beat 'em up]] video game developed and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Master System]]. The story follows Riki, a martial artist on a mission to save his girlfriend from his rival. Gameplay consists of a series of [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stages where the player battles waves of minor enemies and the occasional [[Boss (video games)#Miniboss|sub-boss]]. Stages culminate in more challenging [[Boss (video games)|boss]] encounters, each requiring the player to use a specific attack to win.

The game is a modification of the Japanese [[Master System#Mark III|Mark III]] title, {{nihongo foot|'''''Hokuto no Ken'''''|北斗の拳||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, based on the [[manga]] series of the same name, which is known as ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'' outside Japan. The export version of the game was released without this license, forcing alterations to character names and graphics. It is one of the earliest works of [[game programmer|programmer]] [[Yuji Naka]] prior to his involvement in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''.

First released in Japan in July 1986, ''Black Belt'' was localized for North America, Europe, and Brazil. Japan also saw a [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] re-release and a [[PlayStation 2]] remake as part of the ''[[Sega Ages]]'' line. While commonly compared to [[Irem]]'s ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' in both visuals and mechanics, ''Black Belt'' received mixed reactions from critics with some consensus on its boss fights being a positive highlight and its levels being too repetitive.

==Plot and gameplay==

''Black Belt'' is a [[beat 'em up]] in which  the player takes control of a martial artist named Riki{{efn|Named {{nihongo|[[Kenshiro]]|ケンシロウ|Kenshirō}} in the original Japanese version}}, who sets out to rescue his girlfriend Kyoko{{efn|Named {{nihongo|[[List of Fist of the North Star characters#Yuria|Yuria]]|ユリア|Yuria}} in the original Japanese version}} from his rival Wang{{efn|Named {{nihongo|[[Raoh]]|ラオウ|Raō}} in the original Japanese version}}. The game is composed of a series of left-to-right, [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stages (or "chapters") in which Riki must utilize punches, kicks, and jumps to defeat different types of minor underlings and the occasional [[Boss (video games)#Miniboss|sub-boss]].<ref name="manual">{{cite book | author=Sega staff |date=November 1986 | title=Black Belt ''Instruction Manual'' | url=https://archive.org/details/Black_Belt_1986_U/mode/1up | publisher=[[Sega|Sega of America]] | id=010086050547 | pages=2–10}}</ref><ref name="hcg101">{{cite web | author=Kulata, Kurt | date=December 18, 2007 | title=''Black Belt'' | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/black-belt/amp/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230331124758/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/black-belt/amp/ | archive-date=March 31, 2023 | website=[[Hardcore Gaming 101]] | accessdate=December 14, 2023}}</ref><ref name="computerentertainer"/> The player's [[health (game terminology)|health]] meter, remaining time, and [[Score (game)#Video games|score]] are displayed along the top of the screen.

==Development and release==
''Black Belt'' was developed and published by [[Sega]]. In Japan, the game was titled ''Hokuto no Ken'' and was an adaptation of the [[manga]] of the [[Fist of the North Star|same name]]. Mutsuhiro Fujii recalled that the company's design teams were working on about 20 titles simultaneously by the time the [[Master System#Mark III|Mark III]] went to market. Having just acquired the ''Hokuto no Ken'' license, his team created this game utilizing the console's improved one [[megabit]] cartridge technology.<ref>{{cite web | author=Sega staff | title=Vol. 05 ''Fantasy Zone'' (Sega Mark III) Masterpiece Interview | url=https://www.sega.jp/fb/album/05_fz/interview1.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231117115957/https://www.sega.jp/fb/album/05_fz/interview1.html | archive-date=November 17, 2023| publisher=[[Sega]] | language=ja | accessdate=December 12, 2023}}</ref>

Critical reception for ''Black Belt'' has been mixed. Print and online media outlets disagreed on the quality of its visuals and gameplay while commonly comparing it to [[Irem]]'s ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]''. A duplicate review from ''[[Mean Machines|Mean Machines Sega]]'' and ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' in their "Complete Guide to Consoles" highly recommended ''Black Belt'' for being "tough and challenging" and one of Sega's better beat 'em ups.<ref name="cvg2"/> ''[[Hardcore Gaming 101]]'' founder Kurt Kulata noted it as "little more than a rip-off" of ''Kung-Fu Master''" but with better controls and more varied level design. Combined with "fantastic visuals" such as its "extremely impressive" use of [[parallax scrolling]] for backgrounds, he declared ''Black Belt'' one of the Master System's finest games in the console's early line-up.<ref name="hcg101"/> Kulata, Levi Buchanan of ''[[IGN]]'', and the French magazine ''[[:fr:Gen4|Génération 4]]'' all described the one-on-one [[fighting video game|fighting]] boss battles as its highlight. Both Kukata and Buchanan noted this preceded the same feature popularized in [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]''.<ref name="hcg101"/><ref name="ignreview"/> ''[[Computer Entertainer]]'' editor Celeste Dolan positively likened the protagonist's [[superhuman]] abilities to those seen in some [[martial arts film]]s, concluding that the game contained "good, frenzied action with plenty of challenge".<ref name="computerentertainer">{{cite magazine | title=Critically Speaking...Sega Compatible | author=Dolan, Celeste | date=December 1986 | url=https://archive.org/details/computer-entertainer-5-9/page/12/mode/1up | magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]] | volume=5 | issue=9 | page=12 | issn=0890-2143}}</ref> ''[[1Up Network|Retronauts]]'' was recommendatory of the original Japanese version owing to its graphics, fast-paced action, and faithfulness to its source material.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' labeled ''Black Belt'' a "straight ahead imitator" of ''Kung-Fu Master'' and the most traditional among Sega's Master System martial arts games. The magazine commended the game's inclusion of a basic plot and its instruction booklet's differentiation of oriental combat styles but mocked its translation.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Video Gaming World | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=52 | date=October 1988 | url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_52/page/n47/mode/2up | last1=Worley | first1=Joyce | last2=Kunkel | first2=Bill | last3=Katz | first3=Arnie | pages=48–9 | publisher=Golden Empire Publications, Inc. | issn=0744-6667}}</ref> Buchanan criticized the potential for the player to die during boss fights and then have to start the entire game over.<ref name="ignreview"/> Several critics believed the gameplay of fighting through waves of enemies to be monotonous.
