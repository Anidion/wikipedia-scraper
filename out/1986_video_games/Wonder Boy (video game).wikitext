{{nihongo|'''''Wonder Boy'''''|ワンダーボーイ|Wandā Bōi}} is a [[1986 in video gaming|1986]] [[platform game]] published by [[Sega]] and developed by Escape (now known as [[Westone Bit Entertainment]]). Originally designed for [[Arcade game|arcades]], it was later ported to the [[SG-1000]], [[Master System|Mark III/Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] [[video game console]]s by Sega, and to the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] [[home computer]]s by [[Activision]]. The game is also known as {{nihongo|'''''Super Wonder Boy'''''|スーパーワンダーボーイ|Sūpā Wandā Bōi}} for its [[Sega Mark III]] release in [[Video gaming in Japan|Japan]] and '''''Revenge of Drancon''''' for its [[Game Gear]] release in [[North America]]. A [[High-definition video|high definition]] [[video game remake|remake]] of the game, titled ''Wonder Boy Returns'', was developed by CFK and released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] on October 12, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/523810/Wonder_Boy_Returns/|title=Save 60% on Wonder Boy Returns on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com}}</ref> ''Wonder Boy'' was rereleased in 2022 as part of ''Wonder Boy Collection'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]] which includes its versions on arcade, Master System, SG-1000 and Game Gear.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/its-official-wonder-boy-collection-is-out-on-3rd-june | title=It's Official, Wonder Boy Collection is Out on 3rd June | date=24 May 2022 }}</ref>

It was the first in the long-running ''[[Wonder Boy]]'' series of games and was followed up by five sequels, ''[[Wonder Boy in Monster Land]]'', ''[[Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair]]'', ''[[Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap]]'', ''[[Wonder Boy in Monster World]]'' and ''[[Monster World IV]]''. The game was also adapted by [[Hudson Soft]] as ''[[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]]'', which spawned its own series of games.

==Gameplay==
The titular Wonder Boy{{efn|Later named Tom-Tom in the Master System version, known simply as "Boy" in the Japanese versions}} is a tribal caveman-like boy whose girlfriend Tina{{efn|Tina was later renamed Tanya in the Master System version}} [[Damsel in distress#In video games|has been captured]] by the [[Dark lord|dark King]] (known as Drancon in the Game Gear version). The player must guide the Wonder Boy through seven "areas", each consisting of four "rounds".

The boy can arm himself with a stone [[hatchet]], which he can throw at oncoming foes, a [[skateboard]] with which he can rush through the levels and temporary protection by an [[angel]] which allows him to destroy foes by simply running into them. All of the aforementioned [[power-up]]s are obtained by breaking open eggs. These eggs can also contain unpleasant surprises – curses which cause him to lose vitality more quickly than usual, and poisonous mushrooms which reduce the boy's vitality in one go. The player must remain aware of the vitality meter, which constantly runs down at a steady pace and can only be refilled by collecting food throughout the level. There is also one doll to collect in each level, which doubles the bonus points awarded at the end of the level. If all 28 dolls are collected, then a bonus eighth area will be unlocked.

At the end of every "area", the boy will encounter an incarnation of the chief antagonist as a [[Boss (video games)|boss character]]. Once defeated, the mighty lord's mask flies off and transforms into an item such as a tea cup or a piece of fruit, before subsequently making his escape. A two-player alternating mode is available where each player takes turn whenever the other one loses a life.

== Plot ==
In the far past, a Boy is attacked by the Evil King. He manages to escape, but The king kidnaps his girlfriend, Tina. the Boy explores the island and avoids the Grim Reaper, who has set out under the command of The King to lead him to his doom. After questing for ages, the Boy confronts the and saves Tina. After returning home, The Boy is heralded as a "Wonder Boy".

== Arcade hardware ==
The game ran on Sega's proprietary [[Sega System 1|System 1]] hardware, based on a [[Z80]] processor running at 4&nbsp;MHz. Audio was provided by two 2&nbsp;MHz [[SN76496]] chips with a 4&nbsp;MHz Z80 [[co-processor]]. The graphics were provided by a [[Raster graphics|raster video]] unit at a [[Display resolution|resolution]] of 256 x 224.

The game required a cabinet that provided a two-axis joystick and three input buttons – one to act as a start button, two as gameplay buttons.

== Ports ==

===SG-1000===
The first home version of ''Wonder Boy'' was released exclusively in [[Japan]] for the [[SG-1000]] (Sega's first video game console) during the same year the arcade version was released. The game was released in a "My Card" format, which required the "Card Catcher" peripheral. Because of the severe hardware differences, the game was remade completely for the SG-1000 with an all new set of stages. Certain enemies, stages, and items were also omitted, such as the skateboard.

===Master System and Game Gear===
The version of ''Wonder Boy'' for the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] was a direct port of the arcade title, with some minor reductions to accommodate the more limited hardware. In Japan, the Sega Mark III version was entitled ''Super Wonder Boy'' to differentiate it from the previous port, although the overseas releases dropped the word "Super" from the title. The Game Gear port in the United States was entitled ''Revenge of Drancon''.

The graphics were lifted straight from the arcade version, but the [[Heads-up display (video games)|HUD]] was restricted to a simple vitality bar – the score and number of lives were displayed prior to starting the level. The sound was modified slightly to adapt it to the more limited audio hardware. The graphics were brighter. The controls were modified slightly to make it possible to only perform a high jump when the run button was pressed, whereas it was possible in the arcade version to perform one simply by being in motion when the jump button was pressed.

However, the most important aspect that differentiated it from its arcade counterpart was the addition of "areas". ''Wonder Boy'' for the Master System and Game Gear had nine areas; this included all seven areas from the arcade original plus two new areas created specifically for this version. The new areas featured unique level designs different than the rest of the game. These two areas were dubbed as the fourth area and eighth area in the game. This resulted in a modification on the [[numbering]] for the areas lifted from the arcade original (for example, what was the fourth area on the arcade version became the fifth area on the SMS/GG version).

As with the arcade version, collecting all dolls in the game would reveal an extra "area" which, in this case, would be the tenth area.

===Home computers===
The license to produce the home computer versions of ''Wonder Boy'' was awarded to [[Activision]], who produced versions of the game for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1987. The game was true in spirit to the original, although the levels beyond level 4 differed to allow for the necessary [[Multi-load games|multi-load]] system. The first round of each area was always a forest, the second an ocean, the third a cave and the fourth a forest at nighttime (the C64 had round 1 at night time and round 4 during the day). This was not the case in the console and arcade versions, in which the areas provided more variation (although based on these same four themes). The Amstrad CPC version contained the graphics used in the C64 conversion, but the sound from the Spectrum conversion.

Some Spectrum versions were afflicted with a bug that prevented the game from preloading all four levels in 128K mode – the fourth level's graphics would not load correctly, and it would be impossible for the player to move before the game crashed and the computer [[Hard reboot|rebooted]] within around three seconds. As a result, 128K owners were forced to [[booting|boot]] into 48K mode to run the game, and did not enjoy the benefit of having all levels preloaded as was designed. Under 48K mode, however, the 128K music still worked.

=== Mobile ===
In 2004, Sega released a pixel-perfect conversion of the game designed for mobile phones.

=== Wii Virtual Console ===
On March 31, 2008, ''Wonder Boy'' was made available for play on the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console in North America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/J1zyLWJ7bKB2BXWdHLT8n9_IUzxujGga|title=Wonder Boy|website=www.nintendo.com}}</ref> Japan and Europe got the game a week later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Virtual-Console-Wii-/Wonder-Boy--280152.html|title=Wonder Boy™|website=Nintendo of Europe GmbH}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/software/07.html|title=Wii &#124; Virtual Console バーチャルコンソール|website=www.nintendo.co.jp}}</ref> The game is available for 500 Wii points, and is an emulation of the Sega Master System version.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cruis'n USA and Wonder Boy Now Available on Wii Shop Channel!|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/4uQJLEZJ2G__3IJq5TXii66HmIjir-lJ|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=2008-03-31|accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref>

===Returns series===
A high-definition remake of the game, titled ''Wonder Boy Returns'', was developed by CFK and released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] on October 12, 2016, later releasing on [[PlayStation 4]] on March 30, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/22/13020034/wonder-boy-returns-remake-steam-pc|title=There's yet another Wonder Boy game in the works|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|date=September 22, 2016|website=Polygon}}</ref> A limited run physical edition of the PS4 version was released by Strictly Limited Games on January 27, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://limitedgamenews.com/2019/01/22/wonder-boy-returns-playstation-4/|title=Wonder Boy Returns for PlayStation 4|date=22 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.strictlylimitedgames.com/blogs/strictly-limited-games-releases/wonder-boy-returns|title=Wonder Boy Returns|date=2019-01-27}}</ref>

An enhanced version, ''Wonder Boy Returns Remix'', was released on [[Nintendo Switch]] on May 23, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-05-02/cfk-releases-wonder-boy-returns-remix-game-on-switch-on-may-23/.146333|title = CFK Releases Wonder Boy Returns Remix Game on Switch on May 23| date=24 June 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.strictlylimitedgames.com/blogs/strictly-limited-games-releases/wonder-boy-returns-remix|title=Wonder Boy Returns Remix|date=2022-03-20}}</ref>

===Modified ports===
Escape had a licensing arrangement whereby it owned the rights to the game design, but Sega retained the Wonder Boy trademark. Because of this, Escape teamed up with [[Hudson Soft]] to produce a conversion of the game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], under a new license. To get around the licensing issue, Hudson Soft had the title changed which resulted into ''[[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]]''. Although Hudson could have featured the generic boy  from ''Wonder Boy'' as the main character of ''Adventure Island'', it inserted instead a caricature of [[Takahashi Meijin]] (known as Master Higgins in English games). Since ''Adventure Island'' is based on the arcade version of ''Wonder Boy'', it does not contain any of the original levels found in the Master System or Game Gear ports.<ref name="Hardcore Gaming 101"/> The bonus stage that was reserved for collecting all the dolls in ''Wonder Boy'' is integrated in this game as a regular area.<ref name="Hardcore Gaming 101">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/wonder-boy/|title = Wonder Boy – Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref>

In this arrangement, once again, Hudson Soft retained the rights to the character and name, allowing the company to continue to produce future games using the ''Adventure Island'' name and characters. These sequels are not based on the ''Wonder Boy'' sequels.

Hudson released ''Champion Takahashi's Adventure Island'' for the [[MSX]]. This version featured Master Higgins as the main character but retained the music of ''Wonder Boy'', unlike the NES ''Adventure Island'' which had a completely different soundtrack.

Escape repeated the same kind of task by converting Sega's 1991 beat 'em up arcade ''[[Riot City]]'', into Hudson Soft's 1992 [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD/CD-ROM²|TurboGrafx-CD]] title ''[[Riot Zone]]''.

Through its 2012 absorption of Hudson Soft, [[Konami]] currently owns the rights to the ''Adventure Island'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/04/nintendo-should-buy-these-5-hudson-soft-games-from.html|title=5 Hudson Soft Games Nintendo Should Buy From Konami|website=pastemagazine.com|date=28 April 2015|access-date=11 November 2018|archive-date=2 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002065117/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/04/nintendo-should-buy-these-5-hudson-soft-games-from.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Arcade===
''Wonder Boy'' was a commercial success in arcades. In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Wonder Boy'' on their May 15, 1986 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=284|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 May 1986|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref> It became Japan's tenth highest-grossing table arcade game during the latter [[1986 in video games|half of 1986]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '86 下半期 |trans-title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: Second Half '86 |magazine=Game Machine |issue=300 |publisher=Amusement Press, Inc. |date=15 January 1987 |page=16 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19870115p.pdf#page=9}}</ref> It appeared at number-two on Euromax's nationwide UK arcade chart in 1987, just below [[Capcom]]'s ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'' at number-one.<ref>[http://www.solvalou.com/images/arcade/reviews/69.jpg Arcade Action] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20150117192541/http://www.solvalou.com/images/arcade/reviews/69.jpg |date=2015-01-17 }}, ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', December 1987</ref>

The arcade game was critically acclaimed upon release. In ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', the game was lauded by reviewer Clare Edgeley for the detailed, bright, colorful graphics and simple addictive gameplay, whilst some criticism was leveled towards the lack of variety.<ref name="Computer and Video Games magazine">{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action: Wonder Boy |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |issue=57 (July 1986) |date=16 June 1986 |pages=94–95 |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-057/page/n93/mode/2up}}</ref> She also stated it reminds her of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' though "not as complicated but just as playable."<ref name="Computer and Video Games magazine"/> Writers now note that both games share a common ancestor in ''[[Pac-Land]]''.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web| url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/930/930245p1.html| title=The Legend of Wonder Boy| date=14 November 2008}} [[IGN]].</ref>

===Ports===
The Sega Master System port received positive reviews from ''Computer Entertainer''<ref name="CE"/> and ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''.<ref name="CVG"/>

''[[Amstrad Action]]'' awarded the Amstrad CPC version of the game ''68%'' on its original release in 1987, and ''62%'' on its re-release three years later.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} ''Computing With the Amstrad'' awarded the game ''88%'' on its original release.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Reviewing the ZX Spectrum version, ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' remained unconvinced, citing technical shortcomings, including poor character-based [[scrolling]], considerable slowdown, and confusion induced by the [[monochrome]] display.<ref>Crash Magazine, issue 43, p. 82</ref> On its re-release, while quoting the aforementioned problems, the reviewer was willing to overlook them, highlighting the quality of the sprites and the fun offered by the game, and offering it 69%.<ref>Crash Magazine, issue 79, p. 49</ref> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' was the most enthusiastic about the game, offering it ''8 out of 10'' on its original release,<ref>Sinclair User Magazine, issue 65, p. 67</ref> and ''72%'' on its re-release.<ref>Sinclair User Magazine, issue 100, p.26</ref> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' offered ''7 out of 10'' on its original release<ref>Your Sinclair Magazine, issue 20, p. 32</ref> and ''67%'' on its re-release.<ref>Your Sinclair Magazine, issue 54, p. 51</ref>

The C64 version shares the same graphics as the Amstrad CPC version; unlike the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad versions, however, the game featured smooth horizontal scrolling. [[Computer and Video Games|CVG]] and [[Your Commodore|Your Commodore]] reviewed the game reasonably well on initial release, with Your Commodore remarking that it was an excellent arcade conversion but feeling it was lacking in originality, and CVG describing it as addictive, whilst [[Zzap!64|Zzap]] were much more critical, rating the game 52% and criticising the poor sound and labelling the actual arcade game itself as 'ordinary'.<ref name="zzap64">{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Wonder Boy |url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=028&page=028&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap |url-access=limited |department=Test |magazine=Zzap!64 |publisher=Newsfield Publications Ltd. |date=1987-07-09 |volume=August 2017 |issue=28 |page=28 |access-date=2018-09-25 |via=The Def Guide to Zzap!64 |quote="An unchallenging conversion of a very ordinary arcade game." }}</ref>
