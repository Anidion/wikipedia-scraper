{{nihongo foot|'''''Fantasy Zone'''''|ファンタジーゾーン|Fantajī Zōn|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1986 [[arcade video game]] by [[Sega]], and the first game in the ''Fantasy Zone'' series. It was later ported to a wide variety of consoles, including the [[Master System]]. The player controls a sentient spaceship named Opa-Opa who fights an enemy invasion in the titular group of planets. The game contains a number of features atypical of the traditional [[scrolling shooter]]. The main character, Opa-Opa, is sometimes referred to as Sega's first [[mascot]] character.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kotaku.com/remembering-segas-exiled-mascot-5789284 | title=Remembering Sega's Exiled Mascot | first=Luke | last=Plunkett | date=April 6, 2011 | access-date=December 31, 2021}}</ref>

The game design and main character have many similarities to the earlier ''[[TwinBee]]'', and both are credited with establishing the [[cute 'em up]] subgenre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/fantasy-zone/|title=Fantasy Zone – Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref> It also popularized the concept of a [[boss rush]], a [[Level (video games)|stage]] where the player faces multiple previous [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] again in succession.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Fantasy Zone – 2014 Developer Interview |magazine=Shooting Gameside |date=September 26, 2014 |volume=10 |url=http://shmuplations.com/fantasyzone/ |access-date=4 May 2021}}</ref> Numerous sequels were made over the years.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Fantasy-Zone-Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]

In the game, the player's ship is placed in a level with a number of bases to destroy. When all the bases are gone, the stage boss appears, who must be defeated in order to move on to the next stage. There are eight stages, and in all of them, except the final one, the scrolling camera is not fixed; the player can move either left or right, although the stage loops. The final level consists of a rematch against all of the previous bosses in succession before facing the final boss.

Opa-Opa uses two different attacks: the standard weapon (initially bullets) and bombs. He can also move down to land on the ground by sprouting feet and walking around until he flies again.

It is possible to upgrade Opa-Opa's weapons, get bombs and flying engine to increase speed, and get extra lives. To do these, the player must get money by defeating enemies, bases or bosses, and access a shop by touching a marked balloon. Prices rise with each purchase. When the player chooses to exit or the time runs up, another screen appears to equip these upgrades; only one engine, weapon and bomb can be equipped at a time.

Some of the purchasable weapons have a time limit that starts as soon as the shop is left. Some of the bombs can be used at any moment, but are limited in quantity.Engine upgrades are permanent. The powerups can also be reassigned by reentering the shop or touch a balloon with the word "Select" written on it. If the player loses a life, all of the upgrades are lost.

==Versions==

''Fantasy Zone'' was ported to the [[Master System]], [[MSX]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[X68000]], and [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]]{{mdash}}all with similar gameplay. For example, the Master System version lacks some features such as the radar that indicates the location of the bases or a gauge that indicates energy level, and two of the bosses were replaced by alternate bosses.

Two different versions were released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom and NES]]. The Japanese version was released in 1987, developed and published by [[Sunsoft]]. The American version was released in 1989, developed by Pixel and published unlicensed by [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]]. In 1997, ''Fantasy Zone'' was released in the ''Sega Ages'' series in Japan for the [[Sega Saturn]].

''Fantasy Zone'' was re-released as an [[enhanced remake]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], again in the ''Sega Ages'' series. Although similar in appearance to the arcade version (even incorporating the original arcade sounds), this version uses polygons instead of sprites and adds some stages, including bonus levels with the viewpoint behind Opa-Opa as he tries to collect coins from any boss that was defeated at the moment; this game mode is very similar to ''[[Space Harrier]]'', or the unreleased ''Space Fantasy Zone''. This version was released in North America and Europe as part of the ''[[Sega Classics Collection]]''.

''Fantasy Zone'' was released for mobile phones in 2002 in Japan and in August 2003 in the United States. Due to hardware limitations, this version was divided in three different parts. The Master System version was re-released in Japan for the Virtual Console on March 11, 2008, for Europe and Australia on April 11, and in North America on April 14.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fantasy Zone and Mega Turrican Now Available on Wii Shop Channel!|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/IMOTteeJDspEDNbie3zCZC0suT-skBFt|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=April 14, 2008|access-date=2008-04-14|archive-date=June 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613153355/http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/IMOTteeJDspEDNbie3zCZC0suT-skBFt|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On September 18, the final ''Sega Ages'' disc was devoted to the series, ''Fantasy Zone Complete Collection''. Instead of a 3D remake, it compiles all of the games in the series, including spin-offs, all of Sega's own versions, and a remake of ''Fantasy Zone II'' for [[System 16]] hardware.

The original arcade version is unlockable in ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]''. A 3D port of the game was released on March 19, 2014 for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] titled ''3D Fantasy Zone: Opa-Opa Bros.'' New features of the 3DS port involve stereoscopic 3D visuals, adjustable difficulty settings, the ability to save the game, the ability to switch to the Japanese versions and US versions of the game, a Stage Select feature, and a new mode which involves the player playing as Upa-Upa, Opa-Opa's brother. The two replacement bosses from the Master System release can be unveiled, each replacing the standard boss.

The arcade version is a minigame in several entries in the [[Yakuza (series)|''Yakuza'' series]], beginning with ''[[Yakuza 0]]''.<ref name=Gamespot>{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/yakuza-0-review/1900-6416602/ | title= Yakuza 0 Review | last= Brown | first= Peter | date= January 19, 2017 | access-date= December 15, 2017}}</ref> It is identical to the original arcade release, except the addition of a rapid fire button.

[[Sega Genesis]] port of the game was developed for the Sega Genesis Mini 2, the successor to the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] microconsole, which was released on October 27, 2022. The port added a Super Easy mode.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-announces-a-mega-drive-mini-2-including-mega-cd-games/ | title=Sega has announced a Mega Drive Mini 2, including Mega CD games | date=June 3, 2022}}</ref>
