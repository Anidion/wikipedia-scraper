'''''Meltdown''''' is an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] [[action-adventure game]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]] published by [[Alligata]] in 1986. There are two versions: a 64k version with basic [[speech synthesis]] and a 128k version featuring much more speech synthesis. A version was also released in [[French language|French]] called '''''Le Syndrome'''''.

==Gameplay==
The player has to navigate three mazes from the 1st floor down to the 3rd floor of a [[nuclear reactor]] to prevent a [[nuclear meltdown]]. There are eight [[computer terminal]]s on each floor, the first allowing access to previous floors. Six of the terminals provide access to a different [[recursion|game within a game]] which the player must win in order to get a [[password]]. Once all six passwords have been retrieved the eighth computer allows the player access to an [[Boss (video games)|end-of-level]] game which the player must complete before being allowed access to the next floor. Altogether there are 24 games (three isometric mazes, 18 sub-games and three end-of-level games) which must be completed to win the whole game. The final game is a [[typing|text-input]] only [[robot]] system for adjusting the [[control rods]] of the reactor so it won't [[Explosion#Nuclear|explode]].
