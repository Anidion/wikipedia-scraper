'''''Sky Runner''''' is a 1986 game for [[MS-DOS]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] made by Cascade. The MS-DOS version uses [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] graphics.

The game is played from the 3rd person perspective with a 3D view similar to ''[[Space Harrier]]''. Gameplay involved controlling an aircraft called a skimmer to shoot down enemy towers. After destroying enough, the skimmer would drop down a skybike, which the player would use to destroy other enemy skybikers, while avoiding obstacles like trees. After destroying enough enemies, a boss character called a harvester would appear, which the player would have to defeat. Upon defeating the harvester the game awards the player with money, and loops back to the player controlling the skimmer.
