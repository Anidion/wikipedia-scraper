==Gameplay==
''Aliens: The Computer Game'' is played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]],<ref name=CF/> and is set inside an atmosphere processing plant, a maze complex consisting of 255 rooms. The player encounters [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] enemies throughout the game. Upon killing an Alien, the body leaves a deadly pool of acid blood that must be avoided. The player also faces the threat of bio-mechanical growth, which, if left uncontained, results in new Alien eggs and [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Facehugger|facehugger]] enemies. The player's ultimate goal is to reach the room that houses the Queen Alien and her nests, both of which must be destroyed. The player can directly control a team of Marine soldiers, or can issue orders to the team from the Mobile Tactical Operations Bay (MTOB). When playing from the MTOB, the player has a view of the team's surroundings via video cameras attached to each soldier's helmet.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=Zzap/><ref name=CG/><ref name=CU/><ref name=YS/>

In 1993, ''[[Commodore Force]]'' ranked the game at number 59 on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games.<ref name=CF>{{cite web|title=Top Ton!|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-101/ZZap_64_Issue_101_Commodore_Force_Issue_11_1993_Autumn#page/n23/mode/2up|website=Commodore Force|date=Autumn 1993|access-date=2017-09-03|pages=24–25}}</ref> In a ''Retro Gamer'' retrospective, Darren Jones opined that "despite being incredible basic to look at, ''Aliens'' dripped with atmosphere and was quite unlike any movie conversion of the time, and not just because it was so bloody good. A first-person view used in the game perfectly matched the moment in the film when the pumped-up marines start exploring the deserted base and, as the game progressed, it managed to capture all the terror and confusion of the movie in a way few other titles have managed."<ref>"Aliens: It's Coming Right At Us". ''Retro Gamer'' 33, p. 86.</ref> The magazine also declared it "the scariest [[8-bit]] game ever made." Stephen Kleckner of [[GamesBeat]] wrote it "may lack the audio/visual punch of [[Aliens: The Computer Game (US Version)|Activision’s ''Aliens'' game]], but the gameplay is more tightly defined and is forward-thinking for its time." He also recommended a [[Windows]] fan remake of ''Aliens'' titled ''LV-426''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/07/games-of-the-alien-series-part-2-the-must-play-edition/view-all/ | title=Games of the Alien series, Part 2: The 'must play' edition | date=7 October 2014 }}</ref>
