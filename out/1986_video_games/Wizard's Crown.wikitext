Academic Matt Barton describes ''Wizard's Crown'' as "probably the most hardcore RPG of its time" and "one of the most sophisticated tactical CRPGs ever designed".<ref name=barton>{{cite book|title=Dungeons and Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games|last=Barton|first=Matt|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2008|isbn=9781439865248|pages=104–107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPPRBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA104}}</ref>  The object of the game is to rescue a magical crown from Tarmon, a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who sealed himself and the crown in his laboratory 500 years previous.

The [[video game design]] and [[game programming|programming]] was done by Paul Murray and Keith Brors, [[game development]] by [[Chuck Kroegel]] and Jeff Johnson, and the rulebook created by Leona Billings. ''Wizard's Crown'' was the first RPG designed in-house by SSI, previously known as a wargame company. Its detailed tactical combat system came from Murray and Brors's background in wargaming, and they brought the complexity of those games to ''Wizard's Crown''{{'}}s tactical combat. For instance, shields block attacks only from the front and left (shielded) side, and not from the rear and right (unshielded side). Spears can attack two squares away, flails ignore the defender's shields, and axes have a chance of breaking shields. There is an option for "quick combat", and regular combat can take as long as 40 minutes per encounter. This combat system influenced SSI's later [[Gold Box]] series of RPGs, but it was streamlined and simplified.<ref name=barton/>

The class system is based on a point buy system, possibly influenced by the [[tabletop role-playing game]]s ''[[RuneQuest]]'' and ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]''. Characters buy classes and skills using Intelligence points. The classes are thief, ranger, fighter, priest and sorcerer, each possessing a distinct set of skills. Characters can have any number of classes, but mixing classes slows advancement. Up to eight characters can be created in a single party. Experience is spent directly on skills, attributes and life points. When a skill level is very low, gains are quick and easy, but they become slow and difficult to raise after reaching high levels. The magic system works like other skills and features a chance of failure based on skill level.<ref name=barton/>

The game is also memorable for its magic weapons, for example, the Storm Longsword or Doom Battleaxe. There are three special series of weapons which can be enchanted to become progressively more powerful:

* The 'Magic' series of weapons does pure magical damage ("injuries") and progresses under the names of 'Magic, Frost, Flaming, Lightning and Storm'.
* The 'Plus' series of weapons cause extra bleeding, which would cause an opponent to pass out ("The opponent lies unmoving") but not die outright.  For example, if all player characters pass out from excessive bleeding in a battle, you lose the battle, but are given a chance to heal them up in camp afterwards.  These weapons are designated with "+1, +2, +3, +4, +5".
* The 'Life Blast' series of weapons are the most powerful in the game. They do direct damage to life points, and a character who is taken out by these weapons is killed; you cannot revive them except with a resurrection spell.  These weapons progress with the names 'Dark, Doom, Soul, Demon and Death'.

''[[Compute!]]'' in 1986 favorably reviewed ''Wizard's Crown'', describing it as "probably the most unusual fantasy game to hit the market in some time".

''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]''{{'}}s review was mixed, stating that ''Wizard's Crown'' "throws in a few new tricks of its own" but "is mostly old wine in new bottles". The magazine concluded that "''Wizard's Crown'' is okay.
