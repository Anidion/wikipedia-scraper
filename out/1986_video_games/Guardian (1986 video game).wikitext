'''''Guardian'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''Get Star'''''|ゲットスター|''Getto Sutā''||lead=yes}} in Japan.}} is a 1986 [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] developed by [[Toaplan]] and published in Japan by [[Taito]] and North America by Kitkorp. In the game, players assume the role of a robot fighting against a multitude of enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]es across six locations on a [[futuristic]] [[science fiction]] [[Setting (narrative)|setting]]. It is notable for marking the debut of ''[[Twin Cobra]]'' and ''[[Hellfire (video game)|Hellfire]]'' [[Video game artist|artist]] Kōetsu Iwabuchi in the [[video game industry]], serving as its graphic designer.

''Guardian'' was considered a financial flop in arcades for Toaplan. As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other [[Intellectual property|IP]]s from the defunct studio.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Guardian (Get Star).png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot]]
''Guardian'' is a science fiction-themed side-scrolling beat 'em up game reminiscent of ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'', where players assume the role of a robot through six increasingly difficult fictional planets, each with a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be fought before progressing any further as the main objective.<ref name="GSGjpf">''Get Star'' arcade flyer (Taito, JP)</ref><ref name="GSGss">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/get-star.html|title=GET STAR|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2019-11-06|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021025731/http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/get-star.html|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}}</ref>

The player controls the robot with a four-way joystick and two attack buttons to punch and kick. The joystick is not only used for crouching, but for jumping as well. Punches and kicks are performed from either a standing, crouching or jumping position.<ref name="GSGss"/> Along the way, there are three types of [[Item (gaming)|item]]s that appear as flashing [[cross]]es: extra energy stock, [[Invincibility (video gaming)|invincibility]] and a long-range [[laser weapon]].<ref name="GSGjpf"/><ref name="GSGss"/> On occasions, a red orb spawns on the ground and when picked up, increases the robot's punching power up to three times.<ref name="GSGjpf"/><ref name="GSGss"/>

The game hosts hidden bonus secrets to be found, which are crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives.<ref name="GSGjpf"/> The title uses a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Running out of energy will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the robot's power to his original state and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to [[Glossary of video game terms#Continue|continue]] playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop.<ref name="GSGss"/>
