David M. Wilson and Johnny L. Wilson reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The graphics routines (with their annoying flip-flop of the stadium perspective) still tend to slow play down, but the game is still significant because of the number of offensive choices available (seven relate to the batter and seven to the baserunner) and defensive options provided (four for the pitcher and five for the fielders)."<ref name="CGW46">{{cite magazine |last1=Wilson |first1=David M. |last2=Wilson |first2=Johnny L. |title=The Boys of Spring: A Computer Sports Survey |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1988 |volume=1 |issue=46 |pages=16â€“17}}</ref>
