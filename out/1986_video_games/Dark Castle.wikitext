'''''Dark Castle''''' is a 1986 [[platform game]] for [[Macintosh]] that was originally published by [[Silicon Beach Software]]. The original game was designed and animated by Mark Pierce and programmed by [[Jonathan Gay]] with Real Sound by Eric Zocher. In ''Dark Castle'', a young hero named Duncan tries to make his way to the evil Black Knight, dodging objects as well as solving occasional puzzles.

A sequel, ''[[Beyond Dark Castle]]'', was released in 1987. A second sequel, ''[[Return to Dark Castle]]'', was released by Super Happy Fun Fun, Inc. and was released on the Mac App store on March 14, 2008.

Ports to other platforms were also published by [[Three-Sixty Pacific]] and Electronic Arts for SEGA Genesis. The series sold over 1 million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superhappyfunfun.com/games/pressreleases/Press_Release_SHFF_Return_to_Dark_Castle_032008.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514130721/http://superhappyfunfun.com/games/pressreleases/Press_Release_SHFF_Return_to_Dark_Castle_032008.pdf|title=A New Hero Arrives to Battle the Black Knight!|website=superhappyfunfun.com|page=2|archivedate=May 14, 2008|date=March 20, 2008|accessdate=July 19, 2023}}</ref>

==Plot==
When the evil Black Knight terrorizes the townspeople, Prince Duncan decides to topple his throne, but in order to do that, he must travel to the four sections of the castle: Fireball, Shield, Trouble, and Black Knight.

After collecting the Fireball and Shield, Duncan makes his way to the Black Knight's throne room, where he topples the Black Knight's throne, and the Black Knight stands up shaking his fist, as a gargoyle takes Duncan to Trouble 3.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Dark-Castle-screenshot.png|thumb|left|alt=A screenshot from the Mac version of the Dark Castle game.|Though released in 1986 with B&W graphics, the Mac version of ''Dark Castle'' featured detailed graphics, animated enemies, climbable ropes, and walkable ledges.]]
The game opens with a vista of the castle with storm clouds in the distance. The opening notes of [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565|Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor]] play and are followed by thunderclaps. The title along with the programming and development credits are shown on this screen.

Movement within ''Dark Castle'' is typical for most platformers. Duncan can run, jump, and duck, and can throw a limited supply of rocks at his enemies. More rocks can be found in little bags along the way, as well as bottles of an [[elixir]] that provide a one-time antidote to bites of the numerous rats and bats found around the castle.

To defeat the Black Knight, Duncan needs to pull several levers which topple him from his throne. To aid Duncan, a magic shield and the power to hurl fireballs can, fortunately, be found within the Dark Castle. The game begins in the Great Hall, where the player can choose from four doors. The large center door leads to the Black Knight. One other is marked with the shield, and the remaining two mysteriously alternate between the fireball course and a more troubling path. The game can be played at three different skill levels, the hardest "Advanced" level containing more enemies and a few extra surprises.

''Dark Castle'' may be the first game to use [[WASD keys]] and [[computer mouse|mouse]] for control.<ref name="moss20180322">{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/315720/The_making_of_Dark_Castle_An_excerpt_from_The_Secret_History_of_Mac_Gaming.php |title=The making of Dark Castle : An excerpt from The Secret History of Mac Gaming |last=Moss |first=Richard |date=2018-03-22 |website=Gamasutra |language=en |access-date=2018-03-25}}</ref> The trajectory and launching of rocks and fireballs are controlled via mouse movement and clicks respectively, while the character's movement is controlled via key strokes.

Duncan easily gets disoriented; when walking into a wall or falling a short distance without jumping he walks around in circles for a moment, mumbling incoherently. He is highly vulnerable to attacks during this time.

Falling into holes in the floor does not cause death but instead leads to a dungeon ("Trouble 3") which can be escaped with some effort. On easier difficulty levels, this causes a delay. However, this may be strategically necessary on the harder difficulty levels so that the player can stock up rocks and elixir.

[[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]]: Playing ''Dark Castle'' (and its sequel) with the computer's clock at December 25 or any Friday the 13th, the Great Hall or the throne room (respectively) will have holiday decorations.

===Levels===
This game has 14 levels, which came out of the 4 doors in the Great Hall, the first two doors are random.

* Leftmost door (usually): Trouble 1, Trouble 2, Trouble 3.
* Farther away door on left side (usually): Fireball 1, Fireball 2, Fireball 3, Fireball 4.
* Middle Door: Black Knight 1, Black Knight 2, Black Knight 3.
* Right Door: Shield 1, Shield 2, Shield 3, Shield 4.

==Development==
Mark Pierce was based in San Francisco with his own company MacroMind, while Jon Gay and the rest of the Silicon Beach team were in San Diego; so after an initial launch meeting, most of the collaboration between Pierce and Gay was handled remotely. Pierce designed the animations in MacroMind's "VideoWorks" (the direct ancestor of Adobe Director) and then mailed the files on floppies to Gay, who then coded the game in 68000 Assembly Language on an Apple Lisa (a few parts like the high-score system were written in Pascal). The digitized sound was created by Eric Zocher who worked with voice actor [[Dick Noel]].

==Ports and remakes==
[[File:Dark_Castle_Atari_ST_screenshot.png|thumb|right|16-color Atari ST version]]
A version for the [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]] was released by [[Electronic Arts]] in [[1991 in video gaming|1991]].

An [[MS-DOS]] version of the original ''Dark Castle'' was also released, which was closer to the original game. Because of the lower resolution, color was used to make up for it; also, because the PC did not have a mouse at the time, aiming was done through the keyboard. There is some controversy over the colors, due to the nature of the coloring.

Versions for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[Commodore 64]] were released in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] by [[Three-Sixty Pacific]]. The [[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]] version, released in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]], was [[game programming|programmed]] by Lane Roathe, and was almost identical to the Macintosh version except for having lower resolution, color graphics, and some controls. [[John Romero]] converted the monochrome Macintosh art to 16-color super-res art.

A version for [[mobile phone|mobile]] was released in [[2006 in video gaming|2006]]. It is developed by Super Happy Fun Fun, which includes one of the two original developers, Mark Stephen Pierce; it was published by [[Bandai]]. It contains slightly remade level designs, borrowing from both ''Dark Castle'' and ''[[Beyond Dark Castle]]'', it also has updated color graphics.<ref>[http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/07/13/darkcastle/index.php "Dark Castle game resurrected for cell phones"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724064640/http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/07/13/darkcastle/index.php |date=2008-07-24 }} from ''MacWorld''</ref>

There was also a version released for [[CD-i]]. As of 2009, there was a port in the works for the [[iOS]].<ref>[http://toucharcade.com/2009/06/15/snowboarding-tnt-big-buck-hunter-pro-and-eventually-dark-castle/ "Dark Castle game being ported for the Ipod touch"] from ''TouchArcade''</ref>

===''Color Dark Castle''===
{{main|Color Dark Castle}}

In [[1994 in video gaming|1994]], the [[video game developer|game developer]] [[Delta Tao Software]] acquired the rights to some of Silicon Beach's old games, from [[Aldus Corporation|Aldus]], and were able to produce and publish the modernized ''Color Dark Castle''.

The new version included full color graphics, while changing some other things such as the Water from fireball 2 and 3 into Lava. This version also included a new difficulty, which let the player skip to the end destination from any door in the great hall (e.g. Great Hall, to Fireball 4) with fewer enemies and easier gameplay. There is also a save feature where the game could be saved in the Great Hall, though only one game could be saved.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that ''Dark Castle'' was "the best arcade game I've seen for the Macintosh, and perhaps the best I've seen on any microcomputer, ever". The reviewer praised the sound and graphics, stating that he did not know that the Macintosh was capable of animations of such quality. He concluded that ''Dark Castle'' "is filled with lots of little touches that show it's one of the first steps toward what Silicon Beach likes to call 'interactive cartoons'."<ref name="boosman198611">{{Cite magazine |last=Boosman |first=Frank |date=November 1986 |title=Macintosh Windows |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&pub=2&id=32 |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=32 |pages=15, 42 |access-date=17 April 2016}}</ref> ''[[BYTE]]'' compared the game to ''[[Lode Runner]]'', writing "There's nothing new about the basic concept, but the execution is impressive". The magazine praised its "slick animation and realistic digitized sound", and concluded that it "is a perfect way to fritter away those long winter evenings when you should be doing something productive".<ref name="shapiro198612">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-12/1986_12_BYTE_11-13_Graphics_Algorithms#page/n335/mode/2up | title=Stocking Stuffers | work=BYTE | date=December 1986 | accessdate=9 May 2015 | author=Shapiro, Ezra | pages=321}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' praised the Amiga version's "brilliant graphics, sound, and atmosphere" but criticized the keyboard/mouse control system and gameplay as too difficult. The reviewer also disliked the disk-based [[copy protection]] which caused him to fear damage to the disk drives, crashes when loading the game, and slow level loading.<ref name="anderson198803">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-03-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_094_1988_Mar#page/n25/mode/2up | title=Dark Castle | work=Compute! | date=March 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Anderson, Rhett | pages=25}}</ref>

Game reviewers Hartley and Pattie Lesser complimented the game in their "The Role of Computers" column in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #122 (1987), calling it "the finest arcade/adventure game ever designed for the Macintosh computer — as a matter of fact, for any computer!" and stating, "The graphics and animation are quite literally stunning!".<ref name="Dragon122">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|author=Lesser, Patricia|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|issue=122|date=June 1987|pages=76–80}}</ref> In a subsequent column, the reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon126">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|author=Lesser, Hartley and Patricia|journal=Dragon |issue=126|date=October 1987 |pages=82–88}}</ref> ''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''Dark Castle'', praising its gameplay, graphics, and sound, stating that "''Dark Castle'' is at its core a shoot-'em-up, duck-'n'-run type of game, but one so finely crafted it deserves a new classification that reflects its fast-paced action as well as its superb animation, graphics, and sound. The game has a humorous aspect as well.", and furthermore stating that "''Dark Castle'' provides the highest quality graphics and sound of any Macintosh game available. Its action is fast and furious, its scripting sublime." ''Macworld'' summarises their review by listing the game's pros and cons, stating "Great graphics, sound, animation, and design" as positives, and stating "None" for ''Dark Castle's'' negatives.<ref>{{cite magazine|last = Goehner|first = Ken|title = Silicon Castle Magic: Dark Castle Review|date = March 1987|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_8703_March_1987|magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|page = [https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_8703_March_1987/page/n153 146]-147}}</ref>

In 1996, ''Computer Gaming World'' declared ''Dark Castle'' the 136th-best computer game ever released.<ref name=cgw150>{{cite magazine | author=Staff | title=150 Best (and 50 Worst) Games of All Time | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=November 1996 | issue=148 | pages=63–65, 68, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 94, 98 }}</ref>

==Legacy==
===''Beyond Dark Castle''===
{{main|Beyond Dark Castle}}

In [[1987 in video gaming|1987]], the [[sequel]] ''Beyond Dark Castle'' was released, in which Duncan has to return and defeat the Black Knight, who is still alive. To access the Black Knight's tower, the player must first gather five magic orbs which are placed in various hard-to-reach places. The orbs must be returned to the Ante Chamber and placed on 5 pedestals for the gate to open so Duncan can face the Black Knight.

''Beyond Dark Castle'' had an engine similar to ''Dark Castle'' but with improvements and additions like a health bar, bombs, and other items, as well as levels where the player could control a "personal helicopter". These levels and [[maze]] levels were [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrollers]] instead of being limited to a single screen. Games could also be saved in a "computer room" level. Like all versions of ''Dark Castle'', if the player beat the game on advanced, it presented a special ending.

===''Return to Dark Castle''===
{{main|Return to Dark Castle}}

In [[2000 in video gaming|2000]], a new sequel called ''Return to Dark Castle'' was announced, being developed by Z Sculpt, where a new young hero called Bryant, the nephew of Duncan, must once again defeat the Black Knight. This game was not released until March 14, 2008.

''Return to Dark Castle'' includes new gameplay mechanics, such as the player being able to keep weapons, and store extra orbs in a room. Though it had been stated that the game would include a [[level editor]], with the ability to create custom quests, this feature is not included in the download. According to the game's official website at Super Happy Fun Fun, the "level editor will be released soon".
