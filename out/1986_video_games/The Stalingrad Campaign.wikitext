==Reception==
M. Evan Brooks reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Simulations Canada's hybrid of board and computer wargames is an interesting concept. While not part of the mainstream in either sphere, the company has staked out a small niche of dedicated gamers. The basic problem with board and counter assists to the computer is a space consideration. Most computer owners do not have the space next to their computer for easy accessibility."<ref name="CGW37">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M. Evan |title=Stalingrad Campaign: If This Is Tuesday, This Must Be Stalingrad! |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=May 1987 |volume=1 |issue=37 |pages=18–19}}</ref>

In ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s 1993 survey of computer wargames, ''The Stalingrad Campaign'' received a score of one star out of five. The magazine remarked that ''The Stalingrad Campaign'' "fails due to a poor interface, poor documentation, and the inability of the game to deliver any semblance of player participation."<ref name=brookssurvey>{{cite magazine | title=Brooks' Book Of Wargames: 1900-1950, R-Z | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=111 |date=October 1993| author=Brooks, M.
