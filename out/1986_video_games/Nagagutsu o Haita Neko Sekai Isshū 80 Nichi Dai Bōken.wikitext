Four years later, the game (with several modifications) was released in North America under the title '''''Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure'''''.

The main character is the [[Puss in Boots]] character from the tale; a cat named Pero ([[Toei Animation]]'s mascot) is also known as 'Perrault' in the game, as that was the name of the original author of the Puss In Boots story, [[Charles Perrault]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} He is known for helping an impoverished master attain wealth through the use of trickery.

==Gameplay==
Loosely based on [[Jules Verne]]'s classic novel ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' tied together with a classic anime, the player has 80 days in order to travel the world; this is shown through a time limit. One day passes in the game approximately every minute, although certain items can subtract the number of remaining days, providing the player with less time to complete the game. If these 80 days elapse before the player finishes the trip, the game is over no matter how many lives the player has remaining. Places that are explored include: [[England]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Arabia]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Alaska]], the [[North Pole]], and [[Big Ben]]. The game features "death water", a video game feature where video game characters instantly die after coming into contact with a watery substance.<ref name="uvlist">[http://www.uvlist.net/game-162371-Nagagutsu+o+Haita+Neko%3A+Sekai+Isshuu+80+Nichi+Daibouken ''Nagagutsu o Haita Neko''] at UV List</ref>

This game also involves driving boats, cars, and balloons in addition to the standard walking through the stages.<ref name="uvlist"/>
