==Gameplay==
Enemies charge and grab the character, ending his life unless the player jostles the control stick to break free. Later enemies also have projectile [[weapon]]s that the player must dodge.<ref>[http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/goemon/goemon.htm Hard Core Gaming]</ref> They are defeated by throwing a found object at them or hitting them with an always-equipped pipe. Jumping on the enemies' heads will push them down a level or off the screen entirely. Levels feature either boss battles or a pile of [[gold bar]]s at the end, worth various points depending on the level.<ref>[http://www.onlinearcadegames.nl/online-arcade/83-mr-goemon Online Arcade Games]</ref>
