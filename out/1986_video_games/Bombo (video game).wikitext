Taken from the game's instructions:

''A wave of insurrection has left the earth littered with bombs primed to explode and destroy mankind. Your commission is to clear the [[pyramids]] of ancient [[Egypt]], [[castles]] of medieval [[Great Britain|Britain]] and hustling, bustling modern day [[New York City]] of this danger before their history becomes just a history. Hurry time is not on your side, neither are the many enemies left to harass you.''

==Gameplay==
Taken from the game's instructions:

{{quote|You must collect 20 [[bomb]]s from each screen, flashing bombs score more points and large bonuses are scored for collecting a majority of flashing bombs. Your [[Jetpack]] allows you full vertical movement in all directions which you must master quickly to work your way through the platforms of each level.}}
