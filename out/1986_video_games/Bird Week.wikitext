The player plays as a bird and can either play the normal game or the single level practice game. The player must feed [[Butterfly|butterflies]] to the baby birds so that they can grow and eventually leave the [[bird nest|nest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/bird-week|title=Bird Week Basic information|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|date=|accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref> The game has no end sequence: beyond level 999, it simply repeats levels until the player loses all of their lives.<ref name="25atwikijp">{{cite web|url=http://www25.atwiki.jp/famicomall/pages/365.html|title=Ending/advanced gameplay information |publisher=FC no Game Seiha Shimasho  |date=3 April 2009|accessdate=2012-12-17|language=ja}}</ref>

Each level represents a different season of the year, beginning in early spring and then progressing through summer and autumn before repeating to the following spring. If the proper number of butterflies are not fed to the babies, then the babies end up starving to death.<ref name="25atwikijp"/> The player loses a life by failing to feed a baby bird, or by being caught by predators and other obstacles.
