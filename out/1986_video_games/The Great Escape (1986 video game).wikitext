'''''The Great Escape''''' is a [[video game]] which shares a title and similar plot to the film ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''. It was programmed by [[Denton Designs]], which went on to produce the similarly acclaimed ''[[Where Time Stood Still]]''. '''''The Great Escape''''' was published by [[Ocean Software]] in 1986 for the [[ZX Spectrum]],<ref>{{WoS game|id=0002125|name=The Great Escape}}</ref> [[Commodore 64]],<ref>[http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=1090 ''The Great Escape''] at Lemon64</ref> [[Amstrad CPC]]<ref>[http://www.cpczone.net/index.php?game=1038 ''The Great Escape''] at CPCZone</ref> and [[DOS]]. The well-known convertor [[Trevor Inns]] created the Commodore 64 version <ref>[http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=1090 ''The Great Escape''] at Lemon64</ref>

==Scenario==
The player controls an unnamed prisoner of war who has been interned in a POW camp somewhere in northern [[Germany]] in 1942. The camp itself is a small castle on a promontory surrounded on three sides by cliffs and the cold [[North Sea]]. The only entry to the camp is by a narrow road through the gatehouse and anyone passing through this must be carrying the correct papers. Everywhere else the camp is surrounded by fences or walls with guard dogs used to patrol the perimeter and guards in observation towers with searchlights posted to watch for any prisoners trying to escape. Beneath the camp there is also a maze of tunnels and drains, although these are dangerous to enter without some kind of light. The player's task is to escape from the camp. There are a number of different ways in which this can be achieved.

==Gameplay==
The gaming environment is displayed in [[Isometric projection|isometric]] 2.5D with the player's character initially in bed at the beginning of a day in the camp. The prisoner has a daily routine, along with all the other prisoners, which includes roll call, exercising, mealtimes and bedtime. The other prisoners will follow this routine and, if the player does not control the main character for a short period of time, their character will join in the routine. There are soldiers guarding the camp and they will apprehend the player if he is seen out of routine (prison guards only arrest on touch and only detect prisoners in their line of sight or indoors).<ref>[[Retro Gamer]] issue 101, page 60</ref>
