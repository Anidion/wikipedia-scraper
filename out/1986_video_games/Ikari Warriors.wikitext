'''''Ikari Warriors''''', known as {{nihongo|'''''Ikari'''''|怒||"Fury"}} in Japan, is a vertically scrolling [[run and gun video game]] released for arcades by [[SNK]] in 1986. It was published in North America by [[Tradewest]]. At the time there were many ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'' [[Video game clone|clones]] on the market. What distinguished ''Ikari Warriors'' were [[Rotary switch|rotary]] [[joystick]]s and a two-player cooperative mode.<ref name="NGen21"/> The rotary joystick controls were in turn based on SNK's earlier ''[[TNK III]]'' (1985). ''Ikari'' was originally intended to be an official licensed adaptation of the film ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), but SNK were initially unable to acquire the rights to the film.

The game was a major commercial success in arcades. It was Japan's second highest-grossing [[Table arcade cabinet|table arcade]] in 1986, and London's third highest-grossing arcade game that year. It was also a major breakthrough US release for SNK, ranking among America's top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games for two years in a row, in 1986 and 1987.

==Gameplay==
The player takes the role of [[commando]]s named [[Ralf Jones|Colonel Ralf Jones]] (red) and Second Lieutenant Clark Still (blue), who must try to reach the village of Ikari. Enemy units attempting to kill the player include tanks, enemy soldiers and helicopters. A number of [[power-up]]s along the way help the player achieve victory.

Players must proceed from the bottom of the screen upwards, towards the village of Ikari. Trying to prevent them from reaching the village are enemy soldiers and other units. Along the way, players may commandeer enemy tanks and helicopters (NES version) to help fight their way through the enemy personnel. The tanks are immune to enemy bullets, but have a limited supply of fuel and will sustain damage when it runs out or the tank is caught in an explosion, taking the player with it unless he can exit the tank and get clear before it blows up. The helicopters have two different weapons, a spread gun and a cannon, and may fly over water.

Rotating the joystick changes the direction the character faced independent of the direction the character was moving, as controlled by pushing the joystick. This gives the player freedom to attack or walk in eight different directions. No shot is fired from directly in front of the player; the warrior uses the machine gun in his right hand, and throws grenades with his left. If a player character takes too long moving up screen, the computer starts using "call for fire". A red spot appears below him; this is tracking fire to speed up the game.

==Hardware==
''Ikari Warriors'' uses SNK's model LS-30 joysticks, which contain a 12-way rotary switch box. The joysticks can be rotated in addition to being pushed in eight directions. The less successful ''[[TNK III]]'', released in 1985 and also from SNK, is the first to have used such joysticks.<ref>[http://arcadeflyers.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=1162&image=2 "Transfer lever as well as turret turning knob"].

''Ikari Warriors'' [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) were manufactured in two different versions: SNK pinout and [[JAMMA]] pinout. Most SNK-pinout units were put into ''Ikari Warriors'' cabinets, while most JAMMA-pinout units were supplied as conversion kits. The SNK-pinout boards have a 22/44-pin edge connectors. The JAMMA-pinout PCBs have a 28/56-pin edge connectors. Both types consist of a stack of three boards, with interconnects.

==Development==
The game was developed by SNK, where it was designed and directed by Koji Obada. He had previously designed SNK's ''[[TNK III]]'' (1985), known as ''T.A.N.K.'' in Japan and Europe, a vertical tank shooter inspired by [[Taito]]'s ''[[Front Line (video game)|Front Line]]'' (1982) that used rotary joystick controls. The same year, [[Capcom]]'s vertical run-and-gun shooter ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'' (1985), known as ''Senjō no Ōkami'' ("Wolf of the Battlefield") in Japan, had become a major global arcade hit. ''Ikari'' combined the run-and-gun shooter gameplay of ''Commando'' with the rotary joysticks and tank vehicles of ''T.A.N.K.''<ref name="Continue">{{cite magazine |title=「怒」を作った男 |trans-title=The Man Who Made "Ikari" |magazine=[[:ja:CONTINUE (雑誌)|Continue]] |date=March 2001 |lang=ja |url=http://shmuplations.com/snkgoldenage/}}</ref>

The game was also inspired by the [[action film]] ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), released as ''Rambo: Ikari no Dasshutsu'' ("Rambo: The Furious Escape") in Japan. Obada had originally intended the game to be an official licensed adaptation of ''Rambo'', but SNK were initially unable to acquire the rights to the film. This resulted in the game's title being shortened to ''Ikari'', referencing part of the film's Japanese title. After the game made its North American debut at an arcade game expo, they got in touch with the film's star [[Sylvester Stallone]], who was friends with SNK's president, about acquiring the rights to the film. However, it was too late by that point, as the game had already become popularly known by its Japanese title ''Ikari'' among arcade players in Japan and North America, leading to the game being officially released as ''Ikari Warriors'' in North America.<ref name="Continue"/>

==Regional differences==
In addition to changing the names of the main characters from Ralf and Clark to Paul and Vince, the military commander the player rescues at the end of the game is named General Kawasaki in the Japanese version (named after SNK's founder Eikichi Kawasaki) and Colonel Cook in the US/Euro version (named after Tradewest's founder Leland Cook). General Kawasaki's name was unchanged in the NES version. The enemies in the game were actually Neo-Nazis, as evidenced by the presence of a swastika at the middle of the final room.

==Ports==
[[File:Ikari Warriors.gif|thumb|left|[[ZX Spectrum]] port]]
''Ikari Warriors'' was initially ported to the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[IBM PC]] by [[Quicksilver Software]] and published by [[Data East|Data East USA]] in the US in 1986.<ref name='retrogamer152'>{{cite magazine |title=The History of Ikari Warriors|magazine=Retro Gamer|issue=152|author=Martyn Carroll|publisher=Imagine Publishing |date=25 February 2016|page=34}}</ref> [[Elite Systems]] acquired the licence for Europe releasing the [[Amstrad CPC]] version in late 1986.<ref name='cvg63'>{{cite magazine |title=Ikari Warriors (Amstrad review)|magazine=Computer and Video Games|issue=63 |publisher=EMAP|author=Tim Metcalfe|date=January 1987|page=19|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=1514&page=19|access-date=7 May 2021}}</ref> A version for the [[ZX Spectrum]] by [[David Perry (game developer)|David Perry]] was scheduled for November 1986<ref name='crash33'>{{cite magazine |title=Elite's Autumn Extravaganza|magazine=Crash |issue=33 |publisher=Newsfield|date=October 1986|page=137|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=1000&page=137|access-date=7 May 2021}}</ref> but was never released.

In 1988 Elite published a second Commodore 64 port (by John Twiddy, programmer of ''[[The Last Ninja]]''), a new ZX Spectrum port (by David Shea, author of the Amstrad version) along with versions for the [[Commodore 16]], [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]].<ref name='retrogamer152' />

SNK released their own port for the [[MSX]] in 1987. The NES version was developed by [[Micronics]]. Both the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 7800]] ports were released in 1990 as one of the final published games for those systems. The game was also included on the ''[[SNK 40th Anniversary Collection]]'' for various modern consoles and [[Windows]] (through [[Steam (service)|Steam]]).

===Conversions===
''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' enthusiastically reviewed the "classy" [[Amstrad]] personal computer conversion, calling the graphics "simply brilliant" and the gameplay "awesomely addictive". They said that players "won't see better ... probably for quite a while" because "the Amstrad graphics are as close as dammit to the arcade machine and the playability goes off the ''C+VG'' scale".<ref name="cvg63"/>

The IBM PC version of the game received 4 out of 5 stars in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]''.<ref name="Dragon142">{{cite magazine|title=The Role of Computers|last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk|magazine=Dragon|issue=142|date=February 1989|pages=42–51|url=https://fapestniegd.xen.prgmr.com/dragon/Drmg142.pdf#page=44}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Ikari Warriors'' spawned the sequels ''[[Victory Road (video game)|Victory Road]]'' (1986) and ''[[Ikari III: The Rescue]]'' (1989).

SNK released an ''Ikari Warriors'' clone in 1987 called ''[[Guerrilla War (video game)|Guerrilla War]]'' (known as ''Guevara'' in Japan). The game features communist fighters [[Che Guevara]] and [[Fidel Castro]] as its heroes.

[[Sylvester Stallone]], whose role as [[John Rambo]] had an influence on the game, owned an ''Ikari Warriors'' arcade cabinet in the 1980s. The future [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) champion [[Kazushi Sakuraba]] (later famous for defeating the [[Gracie family]] of [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] fighters) was also a fan of ''Ikari'' in his high school years.<ref name="Continue"/>

The characters Ralf and Clark appeared again as playable characters in ''[[Metal Slug 6]]'' and ''[[Metal Slug 7|7]]'', as well as in the ''[[King of Fighters]]'' series. Their names were used for two minor unrelated characters in ''[[Crystalis]]'', and they were featured as cameos in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as background characters in the King Of Fighters Stadium stage.
