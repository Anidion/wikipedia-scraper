''The Incredible Shrinking Fireman'' is a [[platform game]] in which the player moves the titular fireman through a series of flip-screen rooms attempting to avoid enemies and search for pieces of a Stretching Rack, to return him to full size.  In keeping with other [[Mastertronic]] platform games of the era, such as the ''[[Magic Knight]]'' series, the character must pick up and use various objects encountered on the way to complete the game.  Possession of certain objects provides access to alternate travel routes (such as moving up through the ceiling).<ref name="Your Sinclair #5 p76">{{cite web |url=http://live.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek/magazines/your-sinclair/5#78 |website=World of Spectrum |accessdate=3 March 2019 |title=Your Sinclair #5 p76}}</ref>
