Three reviewers of ''Zzap!64'' stated that the graphics were "simplistic", but found them to be crisp and colourful.<ref name=zap>{{cite journal|title=Miami Vice review - Zzap!64|journal=Zzap!64|date=October 1986|issue=18|page=103|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=018&amp;page=103&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap&amp;check=1|access-date=21 January 2016}}</ref> Chris Bourne of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'', however, criticised the graphics as "dodgy" and "drab".<ref name=crash/> Jim Lloyd of ''Computer and Video Games'' praised the music and its ability to change once the player moves from a car to building, however theorised that the game would sell due to "its name".<ref name=CVG>{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd|first1=Jim|title=Miami Vice review - CVG|journal=Computer and Video Games|date=October 1986|issue=12|page=41|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue060/Pages/CVG06000041.jpg|access-date=21 January 2016}}</ref> Bourne criticised the game's lack of music for the Amstrad port and limited range of sound effects.<ref name=crash/>
