'''''Batman''''' is a 1986 [[Isometric projection|isometric]] [[action-adventure game]] by [[Ocean Software]] for the [[Amstrad PCW]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The 8000 Plus Collection: The Ultimate Tips Book for the Amstrad PCW |last=Ainsley |first=Rob |year=1989 |chapter=Batman hints |page=105 |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |location=Bath}}</ref> [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[MSX]],<ref name='MobyGames'>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/batman_ |title=Batman |access-date=2009-02-11 |last=Smith |first=Martin |author2=Игги Друге |work=MobyGames |publisher=MobyGames |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228193236/http://www.mobygames.com/game/batman_ |archive-date=28 February 2008}}</ref> and the first [[Batman]] game developed. The game received favourable reviews. An unrelated Batman game was released two years later, titled ''[[Batman: The Caped Crusader]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:ZX Batman.png|left|thumb|ZX Spectrum version]]

The object of the game is to rescue [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] by collecting the seven parts of the Batcraft [[hovercraft]] that are scattered around the [[Batcave]]. The gameplay takes place in a 3D isometric universe, which programmer Jon Ritman and artist Bernie Drummond would further develop for 1987's ''[[Head Over Heels (video game)|Head Over Heels]]'', and is notable for implementing an early example of a [[save game]] system that allows players to restart from an intermediate point in the game on the loss of all lives rather than returning all the way to the start (in this case the point at which Batman collects a "Batstone").<ref name="SinclairUser1">{{cite news | first=Jerry | last=Muir | title=Batman | date=May 1986 | publisher=[[EMAP]] | url =https://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/SinclairUser/Issue050/Pages/SinclairUser05000051.jpg | work =[[Sinclair User]] | access-date = 2009-02-11}}</ref>
