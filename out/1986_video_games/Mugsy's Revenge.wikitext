'''''Mugsy's Revenge''''' is a strategy and management [[computer game]] for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC that was released in 1986. It is effectively a sequel to the earlier ''[[Mugsy (video game)|Mugsy]]'' by the same publisher, and has many of the same features, in both design, and setting.

== Gameplay ==
The player takes the role of 'Mugsy', a gangster who has just been released from prison. The game begins in 1919, and the aim of the game is for Mugsy to make a fortune from the [[rum-running|bootleg]] smuggling business, which has been generated as a result of [[prohibition]]. In each 'turn' of the game, which represents one year, decisions must be made about how much illegal alcohol to buy, which staff to assign to which activity, and how much money to spend on bribing law enforcement. Surviving for ten years means that the game ends, with the repeal of prohibition.

The game had a similar theme and visual style to ''Mugsy'', in that it featured strong, colorful graphics in a similar style to [[comic books]], with information presented to the player in the form of dialogue between on-screen characters, such as Mugsy himself, and an un-named assistant. At each decision point, the player enters text into a dialogue box.

There was also a [[mini-game]] arcade element. This is triggered in the event that one of Mugsy's rivals orders a contract killing on him. When this happens, the player controls Mugsy directly, and must shoot the assassins who are sent after him before Mugsy gets shot too many times himself.

==Controls==
Only a keyboard could be used for the majority of the gameplay, since most of the user input was by text. A joystick could be used for the arcade sequence.

==Release==
The game was released at a price of £8.95 for the Commodore and Amstrad versions, and £7.95 for the Spectrum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-adverts/m/MugsysRevenge.jpg|accessdate=25 June 2015|title=Mugsy's Revenge Advertisement|publisher=Melbourne House}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Reviews of the Spectrum edition were generally warm, and many compared it unfavourably to the original ''Mugsy''. While many reviews were positive about the graphics, gameplay was seen as repetitive. Scores out of ten from magazines were 7<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/mugsysrevenge.htm|title=Mugsy's Revenge|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref> ([[Your Sinclair]]), 6<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/review.aspx?gid=3740&rid=6142|title=Sinclair ZX Spectrum Reviews|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref> ([[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]) and 8 from [[Sinclair User]].

The Commodore reviews were less positive, ranging from 2 out of 10 from [[Your Commodore]], to 6 out of 10 in [[Computer and Video Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D1747|title=Lemon - Commodore 64, C64 Games, Reviews & Music!|work=Lemon64|accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref>
