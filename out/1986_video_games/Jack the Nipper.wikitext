'''''Jack the Nipper''''' is a [[video game]] by [[Gremlin Graphics]] released in 1986 for [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[MSX]]. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Jack the Nipper II: In Coconut Capers]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Jack the Nipper'' is a side-view [[flip screen]] game with puzzle solving and platform elements. The graphics are rendered in [[2D graphics|2D]], but an illusion of depth is achieved by allowing characters to move forward and back within the playing area.

The player controls Jack, a naughty child who wants to break the record for naughtiness (recorded on the "naughtyometer"). He needs to carry out various wicked pranks on the unsuspecting inhabitants of his town, but if he comes into contact by angry adults he will be spanked. With each spanking his "[[Irritant diaper dermatitis|nappy rash]]" meter increases, and if it grows too high Jack loses a life. Contact with the monsters and ghosts which inhabit the town will also increase the nappy rash.

The game went to number 1 in the ZX Spectrum charts, replacing ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'', and reached number 2 in the overall charts behind ''[[Leader Board]]''.<ref name='pcw17july86charts'>{{cite magazine |title=Charts|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|volume=5|issue=29|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=17 July 1986|page=38|url=https://archive.org/details/popular-computing-weekly-1986-07-17/page/n37/|access-date=4 October 2023}}</ref>

''[[Sinclair User]]'' described it as having a "[[Wally Week|Wallyish]] style reminiscent of ''[[Pyjamarama]]'', running wild through the village, searching houses, shops and gardens for objects you can use to create havoc elsewhere", in an environment populated by "[[The Beano|Beano]]"-type characters. The review noted how it was "tempting when you come across a well-tended garden and you just happen to have a bottle of weed killer ... And then there's the tin of glue and the false teeth factory..."<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{Citation|title=Jack the Nipper Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=August 1986}}</ref>
