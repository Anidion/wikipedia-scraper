'''''Killed Until Dead''''' is an [[adventure game]] developed by [[Artech Digital Entertainment|Artech]] and published by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] in 1986. It was released on [[Apple II]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

==Gameplay==
The game itself seems to be inspired by ''[[Cluedo]]'', where the player must eliminate clues as they get closer to stopping the crime, the objective being to stop a murder before it happens. Gameplay revolves primarily around interrogating key suspects and interviewing them about other people, places, and objects. False accusations can lead to the player getting killed, lending to the game's humorous ironic sentiments.

==Plot==
Five mystery writers have gathered at a mansion and one of them plans to murder another. The player takes the role of Hercule Holmes, who must piece together all aspects of the crime in order to solve the case. The player can search suspect's rooms, confront them with evidence, and order cameras to record secret meetings.
