==Reception==

''[[Amstrad Action]]'' complimented the "stunning vector graphics" but bemoaned the "pitiful lack of helpful instructions", while deriding it for having "very little relevance to its origin" and being "basically just a shoot-em-up".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Amstrad_Action_Issue_007|title=Amstrad Action Issue 007|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
