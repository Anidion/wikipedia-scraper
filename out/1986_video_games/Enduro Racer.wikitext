{{nihongo|'''''Enduro Racer'''''|エンデューロレーサー}} is an [[arcade racing]] game from [[Sega]]. It was released [[1986 in video gaming|in 1986]] with two [[arcade cabinet]] versions, a stand-up cabinet with handlebars and a full-sized [[dirt bike]] cabinet. It is often seen as a dirt racing version of ''[[Hang-On]]'', as it uses a similar engine and PCB. The game was later released for the [[Master System]] in 1987, the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]] in 1988, and the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Atari ST]] in 1989.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Enduro Racer Arcade.png|thumb|200px|left|Arcade screenshot]]
''Enduro Racer'' is a motorcycle racing game based on the sport of [[Enduro]]. The player rides a [[dirt bike]] through seven stages, which have elevation changes and turns, and must avoid other riders as well as logs and boulders. Controls for the game are based on a motorcycle's handlebars, with a throttle and brake control. Players can pull up the handlebars on the cabinet to perform a [[wheelie]]. Jumping over logs is also possible, but players have to land with the wheelie technique or risk crashing. During the race, players are competing against a timer. Though the timer stops when the player has crashed, restarting is slow and consumes time.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Edgeley|first=Clare|date=February 1987|title=Arcade Action|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=64|page=116}}</ref>

== Development ==
Prior to the development of ''Enduro Racer'', Sega game developer [[Yu Suzuki]] created ''[[Hang-On]]'', his second game with the company. After deciding to make a motorcycle racing game, he had to decide on a style of racing for the game. Suzuki himself was a fan of dirt bikes, along with [[motocross]] and [[Enduro]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2018|isbn=9781476631967|pages=92–97}}</ref> However, Sega's market research concluded that road-based [[MotoGP|GP 500 racing]] was more popular worldwide, so it was selected for use for ''Hang-On''.<ref name="Robinson2">{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Martin|date=March 22, 2015|title=Out Ran: Meeting Yu Suzuki, Sega's original outsider|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-22-out-ran-meeting-yu-suzuki|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220185846/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-22-out-ran-meeting-yu-suzuki|archive-date=December 20, 2015|access-date=December 24, 2015|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''Enduro Racer'' became Suzuki's opportunity to develop a dirt bike game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Enduro Racer|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/enduroracer/enduroracer.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617035449/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/enduroracer/enduroracer.htm|archive-date=June 17, 2015|access-date=June 3, 2015|website=Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref>

In January 1987, Clare Edgeley reviewed the arcade game in ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', praising it as "brilliant" and calling it a different game from ''Hang-On''.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Edgeley|first=Clare|date=January 1987|title=Enduro Racer|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=64 (February 1987)|page=113|url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/5/119}}</ref> In 1993, the Spectrum port and was voted number 50 in the ''[[Your Sinclair]] Official Top 100 Games of All Time''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Top 100 Games of All Time|journal=Your Sinclair|date=September 1993}}</ref> A reviewer for ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' praised the Spectrum port for being as close to an accurate arcade version as the Spectrum hardware can handle, with smooth graphics.<ref name=":3" /> John Gilbert of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' also gave high praise to the Spectrum version, stating that the conversion "puts other top software houses to shame".<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Gilbert|first=John|date=March 1987|title=Enduro Racer|magazine=[[Sinclair User]]|issue=60|pages=24–25}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[Commodore User]]'', reviewer Ferdy Hamilton was disappointed in the Commodore 64's release, citing the "blob-like sprites", jerking controls, and that the conversion could have been better than that for the ZX Spectrum, which he called "unfaultable".<ref name=":1" /> Three reviewers for ''[[Zzap!64]]'' were highly critical of the Commodore 64 port, slamming the game's poor features with one reviewer stating: "It doesn't look, sound, or play anything like the original - in fact, it doesn't play at all well full stop".<ref name=":2" /> A reviewer for ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' wrote that the Atari ST version is a good conversion of the original but that the replacement of the bike noises with music might disappoint some.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=March 1988|title=Screen Test Updates|magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]|issue=6|page=60}}</ref>
