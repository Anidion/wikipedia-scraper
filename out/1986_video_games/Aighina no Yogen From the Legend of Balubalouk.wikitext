Jason, the game's main protagonist is sent to rescue [[Princess]] Laira, the daughter of Aighina (Aigiina). She is the only one knows how to use ''Aura Stars''; which must be collected in five dungeons and re-united in the sixth. Players have to kill enough enemies to uncover a ladder in order to progress. Some stages also contain secrets and may have additional methods to continue in the game.

A very early version of a partial English patch for a NES version was released before the translation project was completed. However, the project never saw completion.<ref>[http://unreleased.lostlevels.org/game.php?number=1194 Translation information] at Lost Levels</ref> However, the game would eventually be ported onto the [[Commodore 64]] in all regions outside Japan.

A North American NES release was planned for 1988 and a fully translated prototype exists.
