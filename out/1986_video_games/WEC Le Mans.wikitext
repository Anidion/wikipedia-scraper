'''''WEC Le Mans''''', known as {{nihongo foot|'''''WEC Le Mans 24'''''|WECル・マン24|WEC Ru Man 24|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan, is a [[racing simulation]] video game released in [[Arcade game|arcades]] by [[Konami]] in 1986. It was the first [[racing video game]] to depict the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] World Endurance Championship (WEC). The Lap of Le Mans is split up into three sections, during which the time of day changes from day to dusk, dusk to night, and night to dawn.

==Gameplay==
The game attempted to realistically simulate car driving, with the car jumping up and down, turning back and forth, and spinning up to 180 degrees, with an emphasis on acceleration, braking, and gear shifting, along with the need for counter-steering to avoid spin-outs. It also featured accurately simulated courses approved by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]], and used [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] to simulate road vibration in the form of a vibrating [[Racing wheel|steering wheel]] that reacts to the driver's acceleration and off-road bumps.<ref>{{KLOV game|10383|WEC Le Mans 24}}</ref>

The game is known as being very difficult to complete: the track's width remains constant at three lanes of racing, and any slight contact with an opposing race car will result in either a spin, or a spectacular flip in the air. Going off the course and running wide at a corner will also end in a spin.

Play continues until timer is depleted and/or four successive laps are completed, which ends the game.

==Arcade cabinet==
[[Image:WECLeMans24.jpg|thumb|left|WEC Le Mans deluxe arcade unit]]

Konami released three different [[video game arcade cabinet]] versions of the video arcade game, an upright machine, a 'mini' spin where the driver sat in a sit-down cockpit, and the 'big' spin version, the deluxe arcade version that would actually spin the gamer around a 360° spinning base, turning left or right depending on the corner. The front of the 'big' spin arcade machine looked like a real Prototype C Race car.

The arcade cabinet was expensive for its time, with a high price of [[Pound sterling|£]]7000 in 1986,<ref name="su_arc"/> equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|7000|1986|r=0}} or [[United States dollar|$]]{{Inflation|US|{{To USD|{{inflation|UK|7000|1986|2012|r=2}}|GBR}}|2012|r=0}} in {{currentyear}}.

==Ports==
The game had several [[Porting|ports]] by [[Imagine Software]] (as Imagine Studios) to [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. A rumored [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] port to the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] was mentioned, but never came to fruition.

She gave it "the edge" over ''Out Run'', mainly for better "movement", but noted "many seem to prefer ''Out Run''".<ref name="cvg_rev1"/> At the [[Amusement Trades Exhibition International|ATEI (Amusement Trades Exhibition International)]] show in January 1987, both ''Out Run'' and ''WEC LE Mans'' "stole the January show" according to ''Computer and Video Games''.<ref name="cvg65"/> Clare Edgeley reviewed it again in the February 1987 issue of ''[[Sinclair User]]'', stating it "is far and way the most sophisticated and certainly the most thrilling game I've ever played", describing it as "like ''[[Hang-On]]''" but "with a racing car which you actually sit inside" and a "movement system" that "is entirely different from anything experienced before" where "you really get thrown around" and "which simulates each action, even spinning" and "shakes the whole car" when going off track or skidding on the marked border lines. She stated "there are hazards to avoid, other cars bombing past you", "great graphics and high speed".<ref name="su_arc">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/103/394/wec_le_mans_review.html|title=Wec Le Mans arcade game review|access-date=12 June 2015}}</ref> ''Top Score'' newsletter called it a "superb driving simulator that was unfortunately overshadowed" by ''Out Run''.<ref name="Top-Score">{{cite news |title=Hot New Games Debut for the Winter Season: AMOA Expo '86 Previews Sizzling Lineup of Video and Pin Games |work=Top Score |date=Winter 1987 |publisher=Amusement Players Association |url=https://archive.org/details/1987WinterTopScore/page/n2}}</ref>
