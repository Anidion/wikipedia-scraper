'''''Zombi''''' is an icon-driven [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure video game]]. It was [[Ubisoft]]'s first publication, released in 1986.<ref>[http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n8/games_games.html "Games, Games and More Games"] article from ''Start'' magazine volume 3 issue 8, March 1989; retrieved from Atarimagazines.com</ref> It was programmed by Yannick Cadin and S. L. Coemelck, with graphics by Patrick Daher and music by Philippe Marchiset.

==Gameplay==
A first-person action adventure, it borrows heavily from the [[George A. Romero]] film ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', being set in a [[zombie]]-filled [[shopping mall]] blocked in by articulated trucks. The player controls four protagonists exploring the mall. If a character's health is depleted, he turns into a zombie, which then roams the room they died in. Zombies can be killed either by numerous body shots or a single shot to the head. Characters are named after the creators of the game.

==Ports==
The game was re-released in 1990, with [[Video game port|ports]] developed for the [[ZX Spectrum]] (by Geoff Phillips, Chris Jones and Steve Chance), [[Commodore 64]] (Jean Noel Moyne, Laurent Poujoulat, Jean Francois Auroux),<ref>[http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=2949 ''Zombi''] at Lemon64.com</ref> [[Amiga]] (Alexander Yarmitsky),<ref>''[http://hol.abime.net/1628 Zombi]'' at Hall of Light</ref> [[Atari ST]] and [[DOS]] (Yannick Cadin).

==Legacy==
Another [[Ubisoft]] title ''[[ZombiU]]'' was release for the [[Wii U]] in 2012 and later ported to the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in 2015. It is debated whether or not this game is a remake/reboot of the original.
