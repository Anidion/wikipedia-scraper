'''''Hoops''''' is a [[college basketball]]-themed 1986 video game published by Hoops for [[IBM PC compatible]] computers written by [[Jeff Sagarin]] and [[Wayne L. Winston|Wayne Winston]],<ref name="Burns1" /> with additional coding done by Jeff Klopfenstein.<ref name="Mitchell1">{{cite web |last1=Mitchell |first1=Jerry |title=HOOPS basketball game |url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/archivesphotos/results/item.do?itemId=P0025404 |website=Indiana University Archives Photograph Collection |publisher=Indiana University |accessdate=14 November 2020 |archive-date=16 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116012053/http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/archivesphotos/results/item.do?itemId=P0025404 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Billy Packer]], the CBS basketball analyst, also provided defensive rating statistics for the game.

==Gameplay==
''Hoops'' is a game in which over 200 college basketball teams are playable in a text-only game, with strategy being changeable during the game by key-inputs.<ref name="CGW38"/> The teams featured in the game included historical teams starting from the 1950 [[City College of New York|CCNY]] basketball team to the 43 best rated college basketballs teams of 1986. The player selects teams to play against each other and  players from each team that would be picked for the game, and then follow the game via a text-based play-by-play and scoreboard.<ref name="Burns1" /> In-game options include giving one team a home-court advantage or playing on a neutral court.<ref name="Peterson1" />

In later editions of the game, the number of teams is increased to 428, fatigue was added as a factor in game-play, and 3-point field goals had also been enabled.<ref name="O'Connell1">{{cite news |last1=O'Connell |first1=Jim |title=Hoops has a winning program |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/452083780/ |accessdate=15 November 2020 |work=The Daily Oklahoman from Oklahoma City |date=27 December 1987 |archive-date=16 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116012047/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/452083780/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Development==
The game began as a table-top game played using cards and dice developed by Winston, but this version proved laborious and time-consuming to play. When Sagarin, a friend of Winston's who worked rating basketball teams for a number of newspapers, bought a computer in 1985, Sagarin suggested converting Winston's table-top game into a computer game.<ref name="Burns1" /> Winston then enlisted Klopfenstein to program the game, and Packer was brought in to provide defensive statistics.<ref name="O'Connell1" />

==Reception==
Reception of the game was broadly positive. Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The game is full of flavor, full of teams and full of options that should delight even the most demanding fan of the cage sport. ''Hoops'' is steadfast in its perspective."<ref name="CGW38">{{cite magazine |last=Teverbaugh |first=Rick |title=Sports Scoreboard |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=June–July 1987 |volume=1 |issue=38 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_38/page/n39/mode/2up |accessdate=14 November 2020 |pages=40–41}}</ref> Ed Burns, writing in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1987, described the game as "extremely sophisticated yet marvelously easy to play", though he also criticised the fact that players did not get tired in the version he reviewed, and that the play-by-play notices were insufficiently tailored to individual players.<ref name="Burns1">{{cite magazine |last1=Burns |first1=Ed |title=WARNING: 'HOOPS' MAY BE ADDICTIVE |url=https://vault.si.com/vault/1987/03/30/warning-hoops-may-be-addictive |accessdate=14 November 2020 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=30 March 1987 |archive-date=16 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116012050/https://vault.si.com/vault/1987/03/30/warning-hoops-may-be-addictive |url-status=live }}</ref>

Writing in March 1990 for [[Strat-O-Matic]]'s ''Strat-O-Matic Review'' magazine, Bart Ewing gave the game a negative review, stating that the game was boring, had too many fouls, and no way of keeping statistics from game to game, would be better with player cards, and that the player playing as coach has too little control over the game.<ref name="Ewing1">{{cite news |last1=Ewing |first1=Bart |title='Hoops' game critiqued |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/digital_museum/Strat+Review/March+1990.pdf |accessdate=15 November 2020 |work=Strat-O-Matic Review |date=March 1990 |page=14 |archive-date=16 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116012010/https://s3.amazonaws.com/digital_museum/Strat+Review/March+1990.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> A later May 1990 review in the same magazine written by Patrick E. Clark disagreed with this view, stating that ''Hoops'' was "a better game than I could ever imagined".<ref name="Clark1">{{cite news |last1=Clark |first1=Patrick E. |title=Another view of 'Hoops' computer game |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/digital_museum/Strat+Review/Strat-O-Matic+Review+May+1990.pdf |accessdate=15 November 2020 |work=Strat-O-Matic Review |date=May 1990 |archive-date=16 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116012010/https://s3.amazonaws.com/digital_museum/Strat+Review/Strat-O-Matic+Review+May+1990.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Legacy==
Winston went on to become a Professor Emeritus of Decision and Information Systems at Indiana University, and Sagarin became a well-known sports statistician.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana University Archives |url=https://twitter.com/IUBArchives/status/1250104441816207363 |website=Twitter |date=14 April 2020 |accessdate=14 November 2020 |archive-date=2020-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116012134/https://twitter.com/IUBArchives/status/1250104441816207363 |url-status=live }}</ref>
