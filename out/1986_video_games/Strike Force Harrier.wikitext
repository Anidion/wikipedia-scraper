'''''Strike Force Harrier''''' is a 1986 [[Combat flight simulation game|combat flight simulation]] video game designed by Rod Hyde and published by [[Mirrorsoft]] for the [[8-bit]] home computers. [[16-bit]] ports were released later.

==Gameplay==
The game simulates the flying of the British attack aircraft [[Harrier jump jet]], known for its vertical takeoff and landing. The objective is to attack an enemy base 250 miles away, filled with [[MiG]] fighters, [[SAM site]]s, and tanks. The game can't be cleared in one go, each sector must be cleared to establish landing, refuelling, and rearming bases for the land forces. A HUD displays essential information on the cockpit window. A radar screen plots the position and any enemies nearby. Red traces warn of missiles requiring evasive action.<ref name="CG"/>
