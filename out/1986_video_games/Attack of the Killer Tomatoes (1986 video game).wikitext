The player must control Wimp as he explores various [[Isometric projection|isometric 3D]] rooms, and attempts to destroy the mutated killer tomatoes.  There are three different types of tomato to be found in the factory:  Killer tomatoes walk around on legs, in square patterns and will kill Wimp if they touch him.  Wimp must destroy these tomatoes by crushing them with a hammer, which can be found somewhere in the factory.  The second type of tomatoes bounce up and down.  Wimp must stop them bouncing by squirting them with tomato sauce, then take them to the crusher to keep up the supply of tomato puree.  The third type of tomatoes sit on the floor of the factory and, if Wimp touches them, they cause the time on the clock to accelerate for a short while.    If "clocking off" time is reached before all the killer tomatoes have been destroyed then the player loses.  Punch cards can be found around the factory which will give the player extra time.<ref name="CRASH_Review">{{Citation|title=Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Review|newspaper=[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]|date=May 1986}}</ref><ref name="ZX_Computing_Review">{{Citation|title=Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Review|newspaper=[[ZX Computing]]|date=May 1986}}</ref>
