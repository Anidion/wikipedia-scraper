{{nihongo foot|'''''Valkyrie no Bōken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu'''''|ワルキューレの冒険 時の鍵伝説|''The Adventure of Valkyrie: The Legend of the Time Key''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a video game developed and published by [[Namco]]. It was released in Japan for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] on August 1, 1986. It was also released for the [[Virtual Console]] of multiple Nintendo consoles, for the [[Wii]] on March 20, 2007, for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] on September 4, 2013 and for the [[Wii U]] on February 4, 2015.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Valkyrie no Boken screenshot.png|thumb|left|Valkyrie being surrounded by a group of enemies.]]
The player controls Valkyrie in her quest to defeat Zouna and restore peace to Marvel Land. Valkyrie fights monsters, collects gold and finds stronger equipment which will increase her powers. Without in-game hints or advice, the player must devise a plan to defeat Zouna, with many of Valkyrie's tasks not immediately apparent; some can only be guessed by exploration and experimentation.

When Valkyrie defeats a monster, she earns experience points towards the next level and (usually) a small amount of money. Although money is scarce in Marvel Land, the player rarely needs it to buy equipment. All the game's items can be obtained for free if the player knows where to look. In addition to equipping weapons and armor, Valkyrie gains access to seven [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]]. When she learns each one depends on her intelligence, which increases with each level of experience. The first, and possibly the most valuable, of these is the healing spell.

==Plot==
In Marvel Land, people coexist in peace and harmony with nature, and the animals are docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Tattas and other races mingle, working to improve their community. A large clock tower, resembling a stone grandfather clock, stands watch over the countryside; an ancient evil was sealed in the clock long ago with a key of time (stored in the middle of its face), and the people have lost their fear.

One day, the clock tower mysteriously stops working. Before long, a villager takes it upon themselves to rewind the clock. Fumbling with the key of time, the villager drops it, and before they can pick it up, Zouna, a dark wizard who manipulates time, escapes and takes the key.

Zouna wreaks havoc in Marvel Land, darkening and terrorizing its people and laying waste to the countryside. Confident in his power, he builds a castle, ruins once-thriving towns and villages, and separates families. Only a few scattered towns remained standing, a futile bastion against Zouna's invasion. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would be subdued heroically by Zouna; Marvel Land needs a savior.

Valkyrie, a fledgling [[shieldmaiden]] descends to Marvel Land from the heavens. In her first adventure, she wields a simple shield and a mace of light. Vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness which has consumed it, her adventure begins.

==Development==
[[File:Odin og Völven by Frølich.jpg|thumb|right|The characters and setting of ''Valkyrie no Bōken'' were based on [[Norse mythology]].]]
Being one of the first third-party companies for the console, Japanese company [[Namco]] was seeing great success with their releases on Nintendo's highly-popular [[Family Computer]]. Their arcade game ports such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Xevious]]'' were unprecedented successes, and generated a lot of revenue for the company. Seeing the Famicom as the next evolution in video games, Namco began to develop exclusive titles for the console instead of simply ports or remakes of their earlier arcade games.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kurokawa |first1=Fumio |title=ビデオゲームの語り部たち 第4部：石村繁一氏が語るナムコの歴史と創業者・中村雅哉氏の魅力 |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |language=ja |website=[[4Gamer]] |publisher=Aetas |access-date=2 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801205701/https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |archive-date=1 August 2019 |date=17 March 2018}}</ref> The first of these was ''[[Star Luster]]'' in 1985, a well-received space combat simulation game.<ref>{{cite news |title=5月10日号特別付録 ファミコンロムカセット オールカタログ」 |agency=Family Computer Magazine |issue=9 |publisher=Tokuma Shoten |date=10 May 1991 |volume=7 |page=204}}</ref> With games like ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' being hugely popular for the console, Namco decided their next game would be a similar role-playing game, with a large, vast world and unique characters.

''Valkyrie no Bōken'' was the result of this. The game's characters and world were designed by character designer Hiroshi Fujii.<ref name="Interviews">{{cite news |title=Valkyrie no Densetsu Developer Interview |url=http://shmuplations.com/legendofvalkyrie/ |access-date=2 April 2020 |agency=Nippon Super |date=January 1991 |via=Shmuplations |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202001243/http://shmuplations.com/legendofvalkyrie/ |archive-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> Joining Namco after graduating college, Fujii was initially assigned to the company's design department, working on the package artwork for games like ''[[Sky Kid]]'', ''[[Tower of Babel (1986 video game)|Tower of Babel]]'', and ''Family Tennis''.<ref name="Interviews"/> Once the division was dissolved, he was transferred to the game development department, becoming a character artist for ''Valkyrie no Bōken''.<ref name="Interviews"/> Fujii's drawings were used heavily for reference by the development team, acting as a design document of sorts.<ref name="Interviews"/> Due to hardware limitations, his drawings could not be accurately replicated in the game itself; most notable of these is Valkyrie herself, being blond on the cover art and having black hair in-game.<ref name="Interviews"/> Fujii looked to [[Norse mythology]] while designing the characters and setting.<ref name="Interviews"/> Valkyrie was originally depicted as a "child of the gods" in early sketches, but was changed to being a simple female warrior due to her design being drastically different from the Valkyries in Norse mythology.<ref name="Interviews"/>

==Release==
Namco published ''Valkyrie no Bōken'' on August 1, 1986.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography |author-link1=Tokyo Photographic Art Museum |title=Family Computer 1983 - 1994 |date=2003 |publisher=Otashuppan |location=Japan |isbn=4872338030}}</ref> It was published under Namcot, Namco's older home console game division from the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Included with the game was a detailed map that showed the first few areas of the game and hints on how to get some of the more valuable items.

In 1998, Namco published [[Namco Anthology 2]] for the [[PlayStation]], which included ports and enhanced remakes of older Namcot games. ''Valkyrie no Bōken'' was included, alongside a remake. This remake had more arcade-like gameplay, similar to the sequel ''Valkyrie no Densetsu'' instead of the original's role-playing format.<ref>{{cite web |title=「ナムコクラシックII」「キングオブキングス」などあの名作が帰って来る ナムコ、PS用ソフト「ナムコアンソロジー2」を発売 |url=https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/corporate/press/namco/1998/1998-september/press-05.html |publisher=[[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] |access-date=5 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200405013250/https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/corporate/press/namco/1998/1998-september/press-05.html |archive-date=5 April 2020 |language=ja |date=21 September 1998}}</ref> ''Namco Anthology 2'' was digitally re-released for the [[PlayStation Network]] in 2013 under the ''Game Archives'' label.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Satsuki |first1=Makoto |title=『ナムコアンソロジー』がPSアーカイブスに登場！ 『ナムコミュージアム』シリーズとあわせて往年の名作をコレクションしよう |url=https://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/774/774775/ |website=Dengeki Online |access-date=5 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204220843/https://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/774/774775/ |archive-date=4 February 2019 |language=ja |date=18 December 2013}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Valkyrie no Bōken'' was followed by ''[[Valkyrie no Densetsu]]'', a 1989 arcade game with simultaneous two-player play and a console conversion released for the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]]. That year an [[MSX2]] game, ''Valkyrie no Bōken II'', was announced; although the [[game demo]] was included on ''DiskStation Compilation No. 4'', its production was canceled.

In 1992 Namco released a [[prequel]] to ''Valkyrie no Bōken'', ''[[Xandra no Daibōken: Valkyrie to no Deai]]'', for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]. Featuring Valkyrie's green amphibian-appearing friend, Krino Sandra (Whirlo), the prequel was released in Europe as ''Whirlo''. ''Valkyrie no Bōken'' was resurrected for the [[PlayStation]] in 1998 on ''[[Namco Anthology|Namco Anthology 2]]'', with an upgraded (linear) version of the game side-by-side with an emulation of the Famicom [[Nonlinear gameplay|original]].

''Walküre no Densetsu Gaiden: Rosa no Bōken'' is a [[visual novel]] game released by Namco for Windows on April 26, 1996. In it, the Great Goddess tasks Rosa with pursuing the monster Tōrushin on a floating island in the sky over Marvel Land.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/micom-basic-1996-03-ozidual/Micom%20Basic%201996%2003%20%28J%20OCR%29/page/158/mode/1up | title=Micom Basic (マイコン BASIC) - March 1996 (600 dpi) | date=March 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/virtual-idol-vol.-07-game-magazine-scan-jp/Virtual%20Idol%20Vol.07%20%28Game%20Magazine%29%28Scan%29%28JP%29/page/n109/mode/1up | title=Virtual Idol Vol 07 (Game Magazine) (Scan) (JP) | date=1996}}</ref> Its [[audio drama]] version was released earlier on March 25. In 2007, Namco released ''[[The Glory of Walküre]]'', an upgrade of the original game with enhanced graphics, for Japanese cell phones using the i-Apli system.
