'''''Portal''''' is a text-driven adventure with a graphical interface published for the [[Amiga]] in 1986 by [[Activision]].{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} The writing is by American author [[Rob Swigart]], and it was produced by Brad Fregger. Ports to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II]], and [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC]] were later released.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} A version for the [[Atari ST]] was announced and developed, but not published.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} Until recently, it was thought that a [[Macintosh]] version was similarly developed yet left unpublished. The published Macintosh version was rediscovered in 2021 by a game collector.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Portal for 68k (no, not that Portal ;) - Macintosh Garden|url=https://macintoshgarden.org/forum/portal-68k-no-not-portal#comment-81307|access-date=2021-06-26|website=macintoshgarden.org}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[File:Portal 1986 screenshot.png|thumb|left|The computer terminal interface]]
The player, taking on the role of the unnamed [[astronaut]] [[protagonist]], returns from a failed 100-year voyage to [[61 Cygni]] to find the Earth devoid of humans. Cars are rusted and covered with moss, the streets are completely barren, and everything appears as though the entire human race had just vanished suddenly. The player happens upon a barely functioning computer terminal that is tied into a storytelling [[mainframe computer|mainframe]], Homer. Through this interface, the player, assisted by Homer who attempts to weave the information into a coherent narrative, discovers information in order to piece together the occurrences leading to the disappearance of the human race. For instance, spending some time in the Medical Records section may unlock a piece of data in the Science section, and through these links the player can finish the game.

==Reception==
''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'' gave the Commodore 64 version of ''Portal'' five stars out of five, describing it as "engrossing, fascinating, and somewhat disturbing ... like a murder mystery, an expedition, and having amnesia all rolled into one".<ref name="info198701">{{Cite magazine |last1=Dunnington |first1=Benn |last2=Brown |first2=Mark R. |last3=Malcolm |first3=Tom |date=January–February 1987 |title=64/128 Gallery |url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n13/mode/2up |magazine=Info |pages=14–21}}</ref> Roy Wagner of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' described the story as "interesting and well-written", but felt the interface was tedious. The Amiga version, using a mouse, was considered superior to that of the C64, and only bothered the reviewer by way of slowing down the reading of the story.<ref name = "CGW">{{citation | date = May 1987 | last = Wagner | first = Roy | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Portal: A Very Novel Game | pages = 32–34}}</ref> The magazine's [[Charles Ardai]] agreed that the interface was tedious and hesitated to recommend it because it was not a game, but said that the quality of the writing was very high.<ref name="ardai198707">{{cite magazine | title=Titans of the Computer Gaming World / Part Three of Five: Ardai on Activision | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June–July 1987 | last=Ardai | first=Charles | authorlink=Charles Ardai | pages=36}}</ref>

==Novel==
A hardcover novel, titled ''Portal: A Dataspace Retrieval'' (1988) and composed mostly of the text from the interactive novel with some new additions, was written by the same author, Rob Swigart, and first published by [[St. Martin's Press]]. It takes the form of a series of notes on different subjects, in an order the player would encounter them through [[Homer]]. A softcover edition was released by Backinprint.com in 2001.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.backinprint.com |publisher=Backinprint.com|author=Swigart, Rob|title=Portal: A Dataspace Retrieval|date=2001}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In April 2012, author Rob Swigart and Subliminal Games launched a [[Kickstarter]] fundraising campaign called "Rob Swigart's Portal (1986) Reborn" to recreate the world of ''Portal'' as a modern third-person adventure game.<ref>[http://www.portal1986.com Rob Swigart's Portal (1986) Reborn]</ref> Some of the features set to be included were moving backward or forward in time through a simulation of the past and changing the character's appearance for different responses and reactions by virtual non-player characters. On June 5, the project creator cancelled the Kickstarter project having raised only $22,796 of the $530,000 target.<ref>{{cite web | website=Kickstarter | url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/subgames/rob-swigarts-portal-1986-reborn-v20/ | title=Rob Swigart's Portal (1986) Reborn}}</ref>
