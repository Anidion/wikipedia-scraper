{{nihongo foot|'''''Slap Fight'''''|スラップファイト|''Surappu Faito''|also known as '''''Alcon''''' in North America|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1986 [[scrolling shooter|vertically scrolling shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed by [[Toaplan]] and published by [[Taito]]. Set on the colonized fictional planet of Theron in the future, where an alien race led by Gaudy have invaded the human-controlled location, players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot taking control of the SW475 [[List of fictional spacecraft#Space fighters|space fighter]] craft in an effort to counterattack the invaders. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[microcomputer]] and [[Home video game console|console]] platforms by various [[third-party developer]]s, with each one featuring several changes or additions compared to the original release.

''Slap Fight'' proved to be popular with arcade players despite a low number of arcade boards manufactured in Japan, but it was met with mixed reception from video game magazines across western regions, specifically the home [[Video game conversion|conversion]]s. Although it never received a direct sequel, the game's ideas and weapon system were later inherited by both ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]'' and ''[[Grind Stormer]]'', with the latter being regarded as its [[spiritual successor]]. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Slap Fight (Alcon).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]
''Slap Fight'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed vertically scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] game reminiscent of ''[[B-Wings]]'', where players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot taking control of the SW475 space fighter craft in a counterattack effort to defeat an invading alien race led by Gaudy on planet Theron as the main objective.<ref name="SFMDmanual">''Slap Fight MD'' manual (Sega Mega Drive, JP)</ref><ref name="SFALCONhg101">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/slap-fight-alcon/|title=Slap Fight / ALCON|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name="SFss">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/slap_fight.html|title=SLAP FIGHT|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja}}</ref> Besides some stationary [[helicopter]]s with blades spinning, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be fought before progressing any further is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard and side shots that travel a max distance of half the screen's height and length.<ref name="SFALCONhg101"/><ref name="SFss"/>

The game's weapon [[power-up]] system takes inspiration from ''[[Gradius]]'';<ref name="SFMDmanual"/><ref name="SFALCONhg101"/><ref name="SFss"/> certain enemies spawn a [[star]]-shaped [[Item (gaming)|item]] upon destruction to be collected, activating an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen that moves a lit cursor through the list of weapon power-ups described below.<ref name="SFMDmanual"/><ref name="SFALCONhg101"/><ref name="SFss"/> However, activating any weapon power-up increases the ship's [[Collision detection#Hitbox|hitbox]], making it a bigger target for enemy fire and difficult to keep successive lives in the heat of battle.<ref name="SFALCONhg101"/> If any power-up is lit but the player's ship is destroyed before a power-up could be selected, the star item is "carried over" and the speed power-up is lit on the next life. A number of hidden bonus secrets to be found are hosted, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as firing on determined locations and certain [[setpiece]]s within the scenery in some stages reveals a bonus secret.

Major weapons affect the enemies and terrain differently. For example, certain enemy towers can only be destroyed with laser or homing missile shots; other enemies are destroyed much faster with specific weapons to match. If [[bomb]] or homing missile shots are equipped, certain bonus targets will appear or parts of the landscape may be destroyed to reveal bonuses. If laser is active, certain plants in the landscape can be shot repeatedly to grow and earn extra points until they scroll off-screen.<ref name="SFss"/> It has been reported that a bug in the game enabled the player to obtain all power-ups, simply by allowing themselves to be killed by the first enemy appearing upon starting the game without touching the controls. If this occurred, the next time the player's ship appears, it has all the power-ups equipped.<ref>{{cite web|author=smac|url=https://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/76529-best-trick-cheat-or-bug-in-an-arcade-game/&do=findComment&comment=1735599|title=Best Trick, Cheat Or Bug In An Arcade Game.. (Page 2)|website=rllmukforum.com|date=16 March 2005|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>

The game employs a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name="SFALCONhg101"/> Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's [[firepower]] to its original state and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to [[Continue (video games)|continue]] playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns. The title does not support continues with extra credits and is believed to loop endlessly.

== Plot ==
The plot of ''Slap Fight'' varies between each region and version.<ref name="SFMDmanual"/><ref name="SFALCONhg101"/><ref name="SFss"/><ref name="ALCONflyer">''Alcon'' arcade flyer (Taito, US)</ref> The game takes place in the year 2059 on another galaxy, mankind has colonized an alien planet called Theon after evacuating a previously colonized planet Orac. Five years ago, the colony on Orac was attacked by alien invaders and the war was so intense that the colonists were forced to leave. Theon is now under attack by the same alien fleet, but the humans are ready. The player assumes the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot in the SW475 space fighter craft to stop the invaders from taking over Theon.

== Development ==

[[File:Slap Fight art design.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the artwork were hand-drawn sketches created by the development team before being transposed to [[pixel art]] graphics.]]
''Slap Fight''{{'}}s development team had a concept for a game that featured secrets, while its main appeal was to keep players investing in long play sessions that revolved around hidden items and the weapon power-up system, as then-Toaplan [[Video game composer|composer]] Masahiro Yuge stated that the team's idea for the game was to add as many secrets as they could such as an alien that resembled one from ''[[Space Invaders]]'', which they included as an homage to Taito, with Yuge citing his affinity for titles with hidden secrets and characters.<ref name="PSGv10">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=東亜プランインタビュー|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=F.S.G Club|date=September 1989|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name="G49">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/gamest0049#page/69/mode/2up|title=東亜プラン|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|pages=68–69|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name="TSCb">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル 特設ページ|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name="STGv4b">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Yūsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=東亜プラン特集 - 元・東亜プラン 開発者インタビュー: 弓削雅稔|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=41–48|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023744/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref> ''Slap Fight'' was also one of the earliest projects Toaplan made using [[game design document]]s, though Yuge claimed that these were added after development as postscripts, since the team "needed some written records".<ref name="TSCa">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=14 November 2011|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030143/https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711134859/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/|date=2018-07-11}}).</ref>

Yuge stated that the weapon change mechanism was intended to be a strategic element in ''Slap Fight'', as the player's ship is rendered invincible.<ref name="TSCb"/> The weapon power-up system was implemented early during the creation process, since the development team wanted to make "that kind of game", while each of the weapons' functionality and roles were decided to be good for certain sections in the title.<ref name="TSCb"/> All of the secrets were planned from the beginning of development and the team kept adding to the idea during the creation process such as secrets that required certain weapons.<ref name="TSCb"/> Another secret, the ship's satellite "option", was an idea suggested by Osamu "Lee" Ōta as a way to give the second player on an [[Arcade cabinet#Cocktail or table cabinets|cocktail cabinet]] a purpose.<ref name="TSCb"/>

The [[Sega Mega Drive]] conversion titled ''Slap Fight MD'' was developed by M.N.M Software, a Japanese game development company founded by former Dempa Micomsoft member Mikito Ichikawa.<ref name="EuroGSFMD">{{cite web|last=Massey|first=Tom|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-12-death-from-above-the-making-of-slap-fight-md|title=Death from Above: The making of Slap Fight MD - Mikito Ichikawa takes us behind the doors of a forgotten classic|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=[[Gamer Network]]|date=5 May 2015|access-date=2019-11-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320144329/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-12-death-from-above-the-making-of-slap-fight-md|archive-date=20 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Ichikawa met then-Toaplan composer [[Tatsuya Uemura]] at the home of late ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'' [[Video game designer|designer]] [[Fukio Mitsuji]], exchanging business cards before Ichikawa found the offices of Toaplan two weeks later.<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/> Being a fan of ''[[Twin Cobra]]'', Ichikawa wanted to make a console port but Uemura told him the game was already being converted by another team. Uemura then asked if Ichikawa could port ''Slap Fight'' instead, which surprised Ichikawa, as the arcade original displayed Taito's logo. He accepted the offer since he was a big fan of the arcade version.<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/>

''Slap Fight MD'', which was created under subcontract from Toaplan, was developed concurrently over the course of one year alongside four other projects at M.N.M Software, including ''[[Streets of Rage 2]]'' and an unreleased Mega Drive conversion of ''[[Rally Bike|Dash Yarō]]'', affecting both development of the port and Ichikawa's health greatly due to increasing overtime to the point of working at home on his [[Personal computer|PC]] while his health condition deteriorated, prompting him with including version information in the project during development as a result.<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/><ref name="Beep21">{{cite web|url=https://note.com/beep21/n/ncd94d6b47320|title=「スラップファイト3671」開発日誌 Beep21出張版 #0|work=Beep21|publisher=note|date=January 28, 2022|access-date=2022-01-29|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220129135650/https://note.com/beep21/n/ncd94d6b47320|archive-date=2022-01-29|url-status=live}}</ref> Uemura served as [[Video game producer|producer]], while [[Video game programmer|programmer]] Jun Shimizu did the coding process entirely by himself and also served as [[level designer]].<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/> ''[[Streets of Rage]]'' composer [[Yuzo Koshiro]] was recruited by Ichikawa to score the music due to his experience with M.N.M, while voicework was done by a friend of Koshiro serving at a US military base.<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/> Ichikawa arranged the original arcade music and claimed that M.N.M originally did not have plans to arrange the arcade's music, however Uemura requested it and after positive feedback from him, led Ichikawa to committing to the task.<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/> Toaplan also provided reference materials used during development of the arcade original to the team at M.N.M.<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/> The cover art was drawn by Parsley Promotion.<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/>

The special mode in ''Slap Fight MD'' was developed by M.N.M due to the fact that their conversion would have not featured as much content if they had followed Toaplan's basic contract of just porting the straight arcade version of ''Slap Fight'' to the Mega Drive.<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/> Ichikawa stated that the special mode was conceived as the "ultimate version" and featured a wider range of strategic play, as the team felt the original arcade release did not offer as many gameplay strategies and depth.<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/> Both Toaplan and M.N.M wanted the port to be catered towards casual and hardcore players.<ref name="EuroGSFMD"/>

According to Tatsuya Uemura, not many arcade boards were produced for ''Slap Fight'' in Japan but proved to be popular among players.<ref name="G49"/> Japanese magazine ''Game Machine'' listed it on their 1 September 1986 issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles such as ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' and ''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=291|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 September 1986|page=23|lang=ja}}</ref> [[Den of Geek]] noted its weapon system and multiple ways to kill enemies.<ref name="T-Hdog">{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/games/58480/toaplan-the-rise-and-fall-of-japans-greatest-shooting-game-company|title=Toaplan: the rise and fall of Japan's greatest shooting game company|work=[[Den of Geek]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|date=21 June 2018|access-date=2020-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621073806/http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/games/58480/toaplan-the-rise-and-fall-of-japans-greatest-shooting-game-company|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
