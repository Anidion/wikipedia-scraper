It was released in Japan in December 1986, in Europe in February 1987, and in North America in July.

The plot of ''Kid Icarus'' revolves around protagonist Pit's quest for three sacred treasures, which he must equip to rescue the [[Greek mythology|Greek]]-inspired fantasy world Angel Land and its ruler, the goddess Palutena. The player controls Pit through platform areas while fighting monsters and collecting items. The objective is to reach the end of the levels, and to find and defeat [[Boss (video games)|boss]] monsters that guard the three treasures. The game was developed by Nintendo's [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Research and Development 1]] division with assistance with an external company (later identified to be Tose), which helped with testing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Monnens |first1=Devin |title=Making of a Myth: The Grueling Development of the Original Kid Icarus |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/29565/making-of-a-myth-the-grueling-development-of-the-original-kid-icarus |website=Nintendo World Report |access-date=February 8, 2019 |date=March 19, 2012 |archive-date=April 7, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407035256/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/29565/making-of-a-myth-the-grueling-development-of-the-original-kid-icarus |url-status=live }}</ref> It was designed by Toru Osawa and [[Yoshio Sakamoto]], directed by [[Satoru Okada]], and produced by [[Gunpei Yokoi]].

It was included in several lists of the best games compiled by ''[[IGN]]'' and ''[[Nintendo Power]]''.

It was later re-released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in Japan in 2004. It was released on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2007 and the [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console in 2013. A ''[[3D Classics]]'' [[Video game remake|remake]] was released in Japan in 2011 and in North America, Europe, and Australia in 2012. In 2016, ''Kid Icarus'' was included on the North American and PAL region releases of the [[NES Classic Edition]]. It was released on [[Nintendo Switch Online]] in 2019.

A sequel, ''[[Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters]]'', was released for the [[Game Boy]] in 1991. A third entry in the series, ''[[Kid Icarus: Uprising]]'', was released for [[Nintendo 3DS]] in March 2012, after Pit's inclusion as a playable character in the 2008 game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''.

Palutena bestowed the people with light to make them happy. Medusa hated the humans, dried up their crop, and turned them to stone. Enraged by this, Palutena transformed Medusa into a monster and banished her to the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]]. Out of revenge, Medusa conspired with the monsters of the Underworld to take over Palutena's residence the Palace in the Sky.<ref name="manualstory"/> She launched a surprise attack, and stole the three sacred treasures — the Mirror Shield, the Light Arrows and the Wings of Pegasus — which deprived Palutena's army of its power. After her soldiers had been turned to stone by Medusa, Palutena was defeated in battle and imprisoned deep inside the Palace in the Sky.

With her last power, she sent a bow and arrow to the young angel Pit. He escapes from his prison in the Underworld and sets out to save Palutena and Angel Land.<ref name="manualstory"/><ref name="jpnstory">{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_pk/vc_pk_02.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106033737/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_pk/vc_pk_02.html |archive-date=November 6, 2010 |url-status=live |title=VC 光神話 パルテナの鏡 – ストーリー |date=January 23, 2007 |language=ja |publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo Co., Ltd]] |access-date=June 23, 2011}}</ref> Throughout the course of the story, Pit retrieves the three sacred treasures from the fortress gatekeepers at their respective fortresses in the Underworld, the Overworld, and the Skyworld.<ref name="manualangelland"/> Afterward, he equips himself with the treasures and storms the sky temple where he defeats Medusa and rescues Palutena.<ref name="gamespy"/> The game has five different endings;<ref name="takeontheneslibrary"/> depending on the player's performance, Palutena may present Pit with headgear or transform him into a full-grown angel.<ref name="gamespy"/><ref name="manualqa">{{cite book|title=Kid Icarus Instruction Booklet |section=Questions and Answers|pages=43–44|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date= July 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/281070/features/time-machine-kid-icarus/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118002612/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/281070/features/time-machine-kid-icarus/ |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |title=Time Machine: Kid Icarus |date=December 30, 2010 |work=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing Limited]] |access-date=July 3, 2011}}</ref> In the Japanese version, the best ending from the English version does not exist, and instead another bad ending is present.<ref name="takeontheneslibrary">{{cite web |title=#26 – Kid Icarus |url=http://takeontheneslibrary.com/finished/26-kid-icarus/ |website=Take on the NES Library |access-date=January 7, 2019 |date=September 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107181229/http://takeontheneslibrary.com/finished/26-kid-icarus/ |archive-date=January 7, 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Development==
The game was designed at [[Nintendo]]'s [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Research and Development 1]] (R&D1) division. It was developed for the [[Family Computer Disk System]] (FDS) because its [[floppy disk]], called Disk Card, has three times the storage capacity of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]]'s [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]] of the time. Combined with the possibility to [[Saved game|store the players' progress]], the Disk Card format enabled the developers to create a longer game with a more extensive game world. ''Kid Icarus'' was the debut of Toru Osawa (credited as Inusawa) as a video game designer, and he was the only staff member working on the game at the beginning of the project.<ref name="nindori">{{cite journal|journal=[[Nintendo Dream]] |script-title=ja:やればやるほどディスクシステムインタビュー(前編)|pages=96–103|date=August 6, 2004|issue=118 |language=ja|publisher=Mainichi Communications Inc.}}</ref> Originally he wanted to make an [[action game]] with [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements, and wrote a story rooted in Greek mythology, which he had always been fond of.<ref name="nindori" /><ref name="staff">{{cite video game|title=Kid Icarus|developer=[[Nintendo|Nintendo Co., Ltd]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=July 1987|scene=staff credits}}</ref> He drew the [[pixel art]], and wrote the [[Specification (technical standard)#Program specification|technical specifications]], which were the basis for the playable prototype. After Nintendo's [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' had been finished, more staff members were allotted to the development of ''Kid Icarus''.<ref name="nindori"/>

The game was directed by [[Satoru Okada]] (credited as S. Okada), and produced by the general manager of the R&D1 division, [[Gunpei Yokoi]] (credited as G. Yokoi). [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] (credited as Hip Tanaka) composed the music.<ref name="nindori"/><ref name="staff"/> [[Yoshio Sakamoto]] (credited as Shikao.S) joined the team upon return from his vacation after the completion of ''Metroid''. He streamlined the development process, and made many decisions that affected the design of ''Kid Icarus''. Several out-of-place elements were included in the game, such as credit cards, a wizard turning player character Pit into an [[eggplant]], and a large, moving nose that was meant to resemble composer Tanaka. Sakamoto attributed this unrestrained humor to the former personnel of the R&D1 division, which he referred to as "strange". Osawa said that he had originally tried to make ''Kid Icarus'' completely serious, but opted for a more humorous approach after objections from the team.<ref name="nindori"/>

To meet the projected release date of December 19, 1986, the staff members worked overtime and often stayed in the office at night. They used torn cardboard boxes as beds, and covered themselves in curtains to resist the low temperatures of the unheated development building. Eventually, ''Kid Icarus'' was finished and entered production a mere three days before the release date. Several ideas for additional stages had to be dropped because of these scheduling conflicts.<ref name="nindori"/>

==Release==
In February and July 1987, respectively, a cartridge-based version was published for the NES in Europe and North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/nes/action/kidicarus/similar.html?mode=versions |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731080141/http://www.gamespot.com/nes/action/kidicarus/similar.html?mode=versions |archive-date=July 31, 2012 |url-status=live |title=Kid Icarus Release |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc]] |access-date=July 3, 2011}}</ref> For this release, the graphics of the ending were updated, and staff credits were added.<ref name="nindori"/> Unlike the Japanese version, which saves the player's progress on the Disk Card, the cartridge version uses a [[Password (video games)|password system]] to restore progress,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_pk/vc_pk_03.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108023852/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_pk/vc_pk_03.html |archive-date=November 8, 2010 |url-status=live |title=VC 光神話 パルテナの鏡 – ゲームの進めかた |date=January 23, 2007 |language=ja |publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo Co., Ltd]] |access-date=June 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Kid Icarus Instruction Booklet |section=How to Start Playing Kid Icarus|pages=9–10|publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=July 1987}}</ref> an almost unprecedented feature.<ref name=EGM100>{{cite magazine |title=100 Best Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=136}} Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.</ref>

By late 2003, 1.76 million copies of ''Kid Icarus'' had been sold worldwide, with a [[cult following]].<ref name="ignnesreview"/><ref>{{cite magazine| magazine=2004 CESA Games White Paper |date=December 31, 2003|title=Kid Icarus|pages=58–63|publisher=[[Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association]]}}</ref> It received mixed reviews from critics over the years. In October 1992, a staff writer of the UK publication ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine|Nintendo Magazine System]]'' said that it was "pretty good fun", but did not "compare too well" to other platform games, due in part to its "rather dated" graphics.<ref name="nmsgi">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Official Nintendo Magazine|Nintendo Magazine System]]|title=8-Bit NES Game Index|page=106|issue=1 |date=October 1992|publisher=[[EMAP|EMAP Images Limited]]}}</ref> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' magazine's Stuart Hunt called it an "unsung hero of the NES" that "looks and sounds pretty". He described the music as "sublime", and the enemy characters as "brilliantly drawn". Although he considered the blend of gameplay elements from different [[Video game genres|genres]] a success, he said that it suffered from "frustrating" design flaws, such as its [[Nintendo hard|high difficulty level]].<ref>{{cite magazine| magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|title=Retro Revival – Kid Icarus: Almost the Pits|pages=88–90|author=Hunt, Stuart|issue=51|date=May 22, 2008|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing Ltd.]]}}</ref> Jeremy Parish of ''[[1Up.com]]'' disagreed with the game's status as an "unfairly forgotten masterpiece" among its substantial Internet following. He found it to be "underwhelming", "[[Software bug|buggy]]", and "pretty annoying", because of "shrill music, loose controls, and some weird design decisions". He said that the game was "[not] terrible, or even bad – just a little lacking". He recommended players to buy the Virtual Console version, if only because it allowed them to experience ''Kid Icarus'' "with a fresh perspective".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/retro-roundup-nestravaganza |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713070604/http://www.1up.com/news/retro-roundup-nestravaganza |archive-date=July 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |title=Retro Roundup 2/15: Kirby, Kid Icarus and Paperboy |author=Parish, Jeremy |date=February 15, 2007 |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[UGO Entertainment, Inc]] |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s Frank Provo reviewed the Virtual Console version. He noted that the gameplay was "[not] the most unique blueprint for a video game", but that it had been "fairly fresh back in 1987". He considered the difficulty "excessive", and found certain areas to be designed to frustrate players. He said that the presentation had not aged well. Though favoring the Grecian scenery, he criticized the graphics for the small, bicolored, and barely animated sprites, the black backgrounds, and the absence of [[Parallax scrolling|multiple scrolling layers]]. He said the music was "nicely composed", but the sound effects were "all taps and thuds". He was dissatisfied with the [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], because the Virtual Console release preserves the slowdown problems of the NES, and removed its cheat codes. He warned potential buyers that they might appreciate ''Kid Icarus'' for its "straightforward gameplay and challenging level layouts", but might "find nothing special in the gameplay and recoil in horror at the unflinching difficulty".<ref name="gamespotreview">{{cite web | url= http://gamespot.com/wii/action/kidicarusnes/review.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090224003402/http://gamespot.com/wii/action/kidicarusnes/review.html | archive-date=February 24, 2009 | url-status=live | title=Kid Icarus Wii Review | date=February 16, 2007 | last=Provo | first=Frank | work=[[GameSpot]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc]] | access-date=April 7, 2010}}</ref> Lucas M. Thomas of ''[[IGN]]'' noted that the game design was "odd" and "not Nintendo's most focused". He said it had "[not] aged in as timeless a manner as many other first-party Nintendo games from the NES era", and described it as "one of those games that made a lot more sense back in the '80s, accompanied by a tips and tricks strategy sheet". He complimented the theme music, which he considered heroic and memorable.<ref name="ignnesreview">{{cite web |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/884/884530p1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703145241/http://retro.ign.com/articles/884/884530p1.html |archive-date=July 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |title=Kid Icarus Review |date=March 6, 2007 |author=Thomas, Lucas M. |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment |access-date=June 26, 2011}}</ref> In his review of the Virtual Console release, Thomas criticized the removal of cheat codes as "nonsensical". He found it to be "not an issue worthy of a prolonged rant", but said that "[Nintendo has] willfully edited its product, and damaged its nostalgic value in the process".<ref name="ignvcreview"/>
