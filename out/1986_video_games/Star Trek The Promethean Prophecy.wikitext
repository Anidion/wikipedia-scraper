==Plot==
Captain [[James T. Kirk]] of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] is on an exploration mission in the Prometheus Solar System when the ship comes under attack by an unknown entity. After [[Spock]] takes over for a hysterical science officer Berryman, the enemy is determined to be a Romulan Bird of Prey. The Romulans reject all incoming transmissions but send threats to the Captain. Helmsman [[Hikaru Sulu]] fires a barrage of four torpedoes at what appears to be a false image of the Romulan vessel. The vessel becomes critically damaged and the Romulan commander tells Kirk that he was avenging his brother whom Kirk had defeated in a prior engagement. Damage reports show that the ship's protein stock used for food synthesis has been contaminated by leaking phaser coolant.<ref name="coolant"/> The captain and a landing crew beam down to Prometheus Four, a class M planet with a concentration of life which appears to be peaceful.

==Reception==
[[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that ''Promethean'' was "light years better than" predecessor ''[[Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative]]'' "in both design and execution", and without its bugs. It concluded "Bottom line: Highly recommended!"{{r|scorpia198703}}
