'''''Uninvited''''' is a black-and-white horror-themed [[point-and-click game|point-and-click]] [[adventure game]]. It was originally developed for the [[Macintosh]] by [[ICOM Simulations]] released in 1986 by [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]] as part of the [[MacVenture]] series. 

The following year, a color version of the game was released for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]], and in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

==Plot==
An unseen man regains consciousness from a car crash in front of a tree. The man's sibling (a younger brother in the PC versions but an older sister in the NES version) is missing, and the car is soon destroyed, as it bursts into flames. Within sight from the wreckage lies an old mansion which the man enters out of curiosity. It is not long before the man is greeted by the first undead dweller.

It gradually becomes evident that the house once belonged to a sorcerer with a number of apprentices. Dracan, the most talented apprentice, became corrupt and killed the other inhabitants with his magic, resulting in the house becoming haunted.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Uninvited_Screenshot_Macintosh.png|thumb|Macintosh screenshot]]

The main house consists of two floors and a tower, most parts being in early 20th century style. Some rooms (e.g. the servant's bedroom) have newer decor. No help is to be found, as there is not a single living person inhabiting the house.

Aside from the house, there are three backyard buildings to explore: the observatory, where some of the final events take place; the greenhouse, which is not as infertile as it first seems; and the chapel, which leads into a cemetery maze. Several places are guarded by magical creatures, including apparitions, hellhounds, and zombies, as well as some more unconventional entities; one is a tiny demon that flies by periodically, holding a key.

There is also an art gallery room hidden in the house. To access the room, the player has to collect two lamps from a fireplace, and click on an odd dot on a painting in a study room. The player will then be teleported to a room containing paintings and sculptures. A door in the art gallery room brings the player to the hall of the observatory. Accessing the art gallery is possible in all versions of ''Uninvited'' except those on the Commodore 64 and NES.

The quest to find the man’s sibling is mostly a matter of gaining access to the locked or guarded parts of the estate. As in the other MacVenture games, there is a time limit. But unlike a regular time limit that is based on seconds or minutes, the time limit in ''Uninvited'' is based on moves (a move is defined as either speaking to a character, entering a room, observing an object, or using an item). If the player runs out of moves, the evil spell of the mansion takes control, and the player eventually ends up as a zombie. This element is partially absent from the NES version, as it is instead caused by a forbidden item when collected. Since the story largely revolves around magic, many of the game's puzzles seem illogical. Hints for these and bits of the background story are unraveled in the various diaries and scrolls found within the grounds. Still, because the gameplay is very non-linear, the ending is somewhat abrupt.

==Ports==
The game was ported to the [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], and [[MS-DOS]] in 1987. It was ported to the Apple [[IIGS]] in 1988, the [[Commodore 64]] in 1989, and the [[NES]] in 1991.

In 1993, an enhanced version of the game was released for [[Windows 3.1x]].

===NES version===
As with the other [[MacVenture#NES ports|NES MacVenture]] games, ''Uninvited'', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Akuma no Shōtaijō'''''|悪魔の招待状||lit. "The Devil's Invitation"}}, added music, and elements of the written narration and storyline were altered, including:
* In the NES version, if the player uses the [[phonograph]] in the Game room (Rec room in original versions), a broken-record version of the main theme from ''[[Shadowgate]]'', another NES-[[porting|ported]] game in the [[MacVenture]] series, will play. (A similar gag appears in another point-and-click game, ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'').
* The sibling trapped in the mansion is changed from a younger brother to an older sister in the NES version.
* The NES version has no time limit unless the player picks up the ruby in one of the bedrooms. Even then, the player can drop the ruby to terminate the time limit.
* As with the other NES ports, the game texts were severely simplified, in some cases also adding hints or elucidations for the gameplay. As an example, a hallway picture reads as follows in the NES version: "It's a small, {{sic}} painting of a young fellow."
* In the original game, the address was, "Master Crowley, [[666 (number)|666]] Blackwell Road, Loch Ness, Scotland". However, at the time the game was released, [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]] had stringent policy necessitating the removal of any remotely offensive material.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crockford |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Crockford |url=http://crockford.com/wrrrld/maniac.html |title=The Expurgation of Maniac Mansion |access-date=June 5, 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.filibustercartoons.com/Nintendo.php Nintendo's Era of Censorship]</ref> Rather than create a new address, it was simply shortened to "Master Crowley". This is likely a reference to [[occult]]ist [[Aleister Crowley]], but Nintendo (perhaps unknowingly) allowed the name to remain in the game. Other changes that may relate to censorship issues are pentagrams turned into stars (or, in one case, a ruby) and a cross into a chalice (while another cross that only served as decoration was removed altogether).
* Beyond the game texts being simplified for the NES port, some of the death texts were edited or altered due to their rather graphic descriptions.
* When performing magic, instead of the typing magic words on a keyboard, the player simply has to scroll through his/her inventory before selecting the words.

The NES version was released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in a package called "8-Bit Adventure Anthology", also released on PC on Steam

==Reception==
''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''Uninvited'' positively, praising its "delightfully sarcastic commentary", "skillfully drawn and plentiful" graphics, and "intriguing and challenging plot", while noting that the puzzles were at times frustratingly difficult.
