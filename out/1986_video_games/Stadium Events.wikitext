'''''Stadium Events'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|''Running Stadium''|ランニングスタジアム|Ranningu Sutajiamu|lead=yes}}.}} is a [[Sports game|sports]] [[exergaming|fitness game]] developed by [[Human Entertainment]] and published by [[Bandai]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. This and ''Athletic World'' are the two games in the ''Family Fun Fitness'' series, designed and branded for the short-lived ''Family Fun Fitness'' mat accessory for the NES. ''Stadium Events'' allows players to compete in four different [[Olympic games|Olympic]] inspired sporting events, using the mat to move as they compete in running and jumping focused gameplay.

The North American version was rebranded by [[Nintendo]] after its 1987 release. The game was re-released as '''''World Class Track Meet''''' and the new mat was titled the [[Power Pad]]. Original North American copies of ''Stadium Events'' are now considered to be among the rarest video games, leading to high prices in the secondary [[video game collecting]] market.

==Gameplay==
''Stadium Events'' is a [[exergaming|fitness game]] that allows the players to compete in four different sporting events: [[Sprint (running)|100M dash]], [[hurdles|110M hurdles]], [[long jump]], and [[triple jump]].<ref name="Stadium Events manual">{{cite book | title=Stadium Events | type=NTSC NES instruction manual booklet | date=1987 | publisher=Bandai}}</ref>{{rp|1–3}} The game utilizes the ''Family Fun Fitness'' control mat which supports up to two players simultaneously, although up to six alternating players can be registered for each event.<ref name="Stadium Events manual"/>{{rp|4–7}} The left side of the mat must be used for the dash and hurdle events, while the other events can use either side. The top speed of the player's runner is dependent upon which row of buttons on the mat is used. If the player lifts their feet slightly before the starting signal, it is considered a false start.<ref name="Stadium Events manual"/>{{rp|8–11}}

The 100M dash event places two players against each other in a race. The 110M hurdles event is similar to the dash, but the players must jump when white box markers appear along the edge of the screen. The long jump has the players running and then jumping and staying in the air as long as possible to record a longer distance. The triple jump is similar to the long jump but includes three separate jump markers.<ref name="Stadium Events manual"/>{{rp|12–19}} In tournament mode, the player must compete against computer players at the 100M dash and 110M hurdle events. The player must beat each of the six computer players at both the dash and hurdle events in order to win. In this mode, three false starts results in a disqualification.<ref name="Stadium Events manual"/>{{rp|8–11}} In another mode, "[[The Olympics]]", numerous players can compete in all four events consecutively. In this mode, the [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness]] 1982 world track record is used as a reference for scoring standards.<ref name="Stadium Events manual"/>{{rp|20–21}}

==Release==
''Stadium Events'' was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America in September 1987.<ref name="gspot_main">{{cite web|title=Stadium Events|url=http://www.gamespot.com/stadium-events/|website=GameSpot|access-date=May 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922171712/http://www.gamespot.com/stadium-events/|archive-date=September 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Nintendo]] saw promise in the ''Family Fun Fitness'' technology, so purchased the mat and re-branded it as the [[Power Pad]]. ''Stadium Events'' was also re-released as ''World Class Track Meet''.<ref name="ESPN"/>

The North American version of ''Stadium Events'' is considered one of the rarest NES games.<ref name="ESPN" /><ref name="ign7" /><ref name="gspotsuper" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> The total number of copies sold to consumers is unknown. The standard minimum initial run for an NES game was around 10,000 copies, but collectors believe the game's scarcity is much higher. A popular rumor that the game was sold at one [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] store was proven false. [[Howard Phillips (consultant)|Howard Phillips]], a former spokesman for [[Nintendo of America]], did not believe the cartridges were destroyed and claimed that reworking all of the cartridges would have been impractical.<ref name="ESPN">{{cite news|last1=Heckert|first1=Justin|title=The true story of Nintendo's most wanted game|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/18121761/the-true-story-nintendo-most-coveted-game?sf43733216=1|accessdate=November 29, 2016|work=[[ESPN.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129082439/http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/18121761/the-true-story-nintendo-most-coveted-game|archivedate=November 29, 2016}}</ref> ''Stadium Events'' copies have been sold for up to {{USD|35,100}} in the [[video game collecting]] market.<ref name="ESPN"/><ref name="ign7">{{cite web|last1=Claiborn|first1=Samuel|title=7 of the Rarest Nintendo Treasures Ever Made|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/27/7-of-the-rarest-nintendo-treasures-ever-made|website=IGN|date=September 27, 2014 |access-date=May 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515082408/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/27/7-of-the-rarest-nintendo-treasures-ever-made|archive-date=May 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="gspotsuper">{{cite web|title=Super-Rare NES Game Sold for $35,100|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-rare-nes-game-sold-for-35-100/1100-6424548/|website=GameSpot|access-date=May 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515073655/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-rare-nes-game-sold-for-35-100/1100-6424548/|archive-date=May 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=191868 |title=Wii Feature: 25 rarest Nintendo games ever |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |date=June 29, 2008 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906205134/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=191868 |archive-date=September 6, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3151658 |title=Instant Rarity: Are Those "Rare" Games Really Worth the Money? from |publisher=1UP.com |date= |access-date=February 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522163238/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3151658 |archive-date=May 22, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
