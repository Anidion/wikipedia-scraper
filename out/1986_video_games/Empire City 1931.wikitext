{{nihongo foot|'''''Empire City: 1931'''''|エンパイア シティ:1931|Enpaia Shiti: 1931|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (known as '''''Street Fight''''' in Germany and the [[Benelux Union]]) is a [[shooter game]] developed by [[Seibu Kaihatsu]] that was originally released into [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1986, by [[Taito]] in Japan and Europe and by [[Romstar]] in North America. The game has players taking on the mafia in 1931 [[New York City]] by gunning down mobsters one by one.

Versions of the game were released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (1987) and [[MSX]] (1988) as {{nihongo foot|'''''Magnum Kiki Ippatsu: Empire City: 1931'''''.|マグナム危機一髪 エンパイアシティー1931|Magunamu Kiki Ippatsu Enpaia Shitī 1931|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}<ref>[http://superfamicom.org/famicom/info/magnum-kiki-ippatsu-empire-city-1931 Japanese title information] at SuperFamicom.org</ref> [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] advertised a release for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in Western regions, but the console version remained exclusive to Japan.<ref name=1up>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9009373|last=Cifaldi|first=Frank|title=The Paper Trail: VideoGames & Computer Entertainment #1|work=Retronauts|publisher=1up.com|date=Nov 10, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709052655/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9009373|archive-date=July 9, 2012}}</ref>

Seibu Kaihatsu eventually released a follow-up game, ''[[Dead Angle]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:MagnumKikiIppatsuBloodSplatters.png|175px|left|thumb|Players control the onscreen crosshair and must shoot enemies before the counter on the bottom right of the screen turns to zero.]]

The game is set in 1931 [[New York City]] where the player controls a young [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who is out to avenge his family members, who were killed in a gang shootout. Over a period of several months, he targets mobsters, culminating with the mafia boss.

Players use a [[joystick]] to move a [[Reticle|crosshair]] around the screen to aim and shoot at mobsters one at a time. They lurk around various areas, including on the street and in windows. An arrow appears that helps direct players to the location of the next mobster onscreen. Players have a set amount of time to find and shoot each enemy; if time is running out, a [[Speech balloon|speech bubble]] appears counting down the last few seconds on the timer. When the timer reaches zero, the player is shot and the screen pans to the location of the enemy. A defend button is available as a last resort to avoid being shot.<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |last1=Edgeley |first1=Clare |title=Arcade Action: Empire City |magazine=[[Computer + Video Games]] |date=15 June 1986 |issue=57 (July 1986) |page=94 |url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/18/118/empire_city_review.html}}</ref> Players can replenish their ammo by shooting hidden ammunition boxes and get bonus points by shooting at gold bars.

Levels are cleared after a set number of mobsters are eliminated. In the game's final level, the player has only one opportunity to assassinate the mob boss as he walks in front of windows in a building. After the final level is completed, the game loops back to the beginning.

The Famicom version is largely the same.<ref>[http://manna.revolver-knight.com/archive/gaming/magnum/magnum.html ''Magnum Kiki Ippatsu: Empire City 1931''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725073951/http://manna.revolver-knight.com/archive/gaming/magnum/magnum.html |date=2008-07-25}} at Manna Revolver Knight</ref> The player's progress can be restored any time in the Famicom version by using a [[password (video gaming)|password]] system of four numbers and/or letters.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Empire City: 1931'' on their August 1, 1986 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=289|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 August 1986|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>

A review by Clare Edgeley in ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said the game was "fast moving, with lots of action" and called it an "unusual and addictive game" that was  "bound to be a winner".<ref name="CVG"/>
