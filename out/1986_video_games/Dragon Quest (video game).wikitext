{{nihongo foot|'''''Dragon Quest''''',|ドラゴンクエスト|Doragon Kuesuto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} titled '''''Dragon Warrior''''' when initially localized to North America, is a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Chunsoft]] and published by [[Enix]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was originally released in Japan in 1986 and by [[Nintendo]] in North America in 1989. It is the first game in the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' video game series. ''Dragon Quest'' has been [[Video game porting|ported]] and [[video game remake|remade]] for several video game platforms, including the [[MSX]], [[MSX2]], [[PC-9801]], [[Super Famicom]], [[Game Boy Color]], [[mobile phone]]s, and [[Nintendo Switch]] as of 2019. The player controls the hero character who is charged with saving the Kingdom of Alefgard and rescuing its princess from the evil Dragonlord. ''Dragon Warrior''{{'}}s story became the second part in a trilogy, with several spinoff [[anime]] and [[manga]] series.

''Dragon Quest'' was created by [[Yuji Horii]], inspired by previous role-playing games such as ''[[Wizardry]]'', ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'', and his own 1983 game ''[[The Portopia Serial Murder Case]]''. Horii wanted to create an introductory RPG for a wide audience. He emphasized storytelling and emotional involvement, and simplified the interface, to translate the mostly Western [[PC game]] genre of RPG to the Japanese [[Video game console|console]] market. [[Mangaka|Manga artist]] and ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' creator [[Akira Toriyama]] produced the artwork and [[Koichi Sugiyama]] composed the music. The North American version features numerous changes, including battery-backed [[Random-access memory|RAM]] save games (rather than using a [[password (video gaming)|password save system]]), larger character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], and pseudo-[[Elizabethan English]] style dialog.

''Dragon Quest'' was commercially successful in Japan, but its later release as ''Dragon Warrior'' in North America was less favorably received. <!-- due to the more popular ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series being released less than a year later -- unsourced, unmentioned in the body --> The original version of the game sold more than {{nowrap|2 million}} copies worldwide, with {{nowrap|1.5 million}} sold in Japan and 500,000 in the United States. Later, Western critics noted the game's shortcomings but acknowledged its importance to the genre. It inspired [[fan-made]] [[ROM hacking|ROM hacks]] with substantial changes. The game's synthesized soundtrack has been orchestrated, and its music has been performed at numerous concerts. As a whole, ''Dragon Quest'' has been credited with establishing the basic template for subsequent [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese console RPGs]].

After receiving some items and gold, the hero sets out on his quest. Much of ''Dragon Warrior'' is spent talking to [[Non-player character|townspeople]] and gathering information from them that leads to additional places, events, and secrets. Towns contain shops that sell improved weapons and armor; general stores where the player may buy other goods; inns that allow the hero to recover his health and magic, and shops that offer keys for purchase. The player may sell items at half price to shops that provide weapons, armor, or general goods. The hero's status window is shown whenever he stops moving, displaying his current [[experience level]] (LV) and the number of [[hit point]]s (HP), [[magic point]]s (MP), gold (G), and [[experience point]]s (E).<ref name=DW1NES>{{cite video game|title=Dragon Warrior|developer=Chunsoft|publisher=Nintendo|date=1989|platform=Nintendo Entertainment System}}</ref><ref name="manual20212932">{{cite book |section=How to Start Off on the Right Foot (What you must do at the beginning of the game) |title=Dragon Warrior: Instruction Booklet |publisher=Nintendo of America |location=Redmond, WA |id=NES-DQ-USA |year=1989 |pages=20–21, 29–32}}</ref>

==Plot==
''Dragon Warrior''{{'}}s plot is a twist on the classic [[damsel in distress]], in that the player does not even have to meet with or speak with her to complete the game.

===Backstory===
''Dragon Warrior'', its sequel, ''[[Dragon Quest&nbsp;II]]'', and its prequel, ''[[Dragon Quest&nbsp;III]]'', make up a trilogy with a shared timeline.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fukushima |first=Yasuhiro|title=Unveiled Secrets of Dragon Warrior&nbsp;II|publisher=[[Enix]]|location=Redmond, WA|year=1990|page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Brad| last=Shoemaker|title=''Dragon Warrior&nbsp;III'' Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/dragonwarrior3/review.html|website=GameSpot|date=August 1, 2001|access-date=February 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220061959/http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/dragonwarrior3/review.html |archive-date=February 20, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The story's background begins when the kingdom of Alefgard was shrouded in permanent darkness. The brave warrior [[Erdrick]] ("Loto" in the Japanese versions and [[Game Boy Color]] remake) defeated an evil creature and restored light to the land. In Erdrick's possession was the Ball of Light, which he used to drive away enemies who threatened the kingdom. Erdrick handed the Ball of Light to King Lorik, and Alefgard remained peaceful for a long time.<ref name=manual56/> The Ball of Light kept winters short in Alefgard and helped maintain peace and prosperity for the region.<ref name="DWExplorerHandbook">{{cite book |section=''Dragon Warrior'' – The Saga |title=Dragon Warrior Explorer's Handbook |pages=58–60}}</ref>

However, there is one man who shunned the Ball of Light's radiance and secluded himself in a mountain cave. One day, while exploring the cave's extensive network of tunnels, the man encountered a sleeping dragon who awoke upon his entrance. He feared the dragon would incinerate him with its fiery breath, but the dragon instead knelt before him and obeyed his commands. This man, who is later discovered to be a dragon,<ref name="np6_52">{{Cite magazine |title=Previews – ''Dragon Warrior''|magazine=Nintendo Power|date=May–June 1989|issue=6|publisher=Tokuma Shoten |location=Redmond, WA |pages=52–53 |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582}}</ref> became known as the Dragonlord.<ref name="DWExplorerHandbook" /> One day, after his soul became corrupted by learning magic,<ref name="np6_52"/> the Dragonlord attacked Tantegel Castle and the nearby town of Breconnary with his fleet of dragons and set the town on fire. Riding a large red dragon, the Dragonlord descended upon Tantegel Castle and stole the Ball of Light. Soon, monsters began to appear throughout the entire land, destroying everything in their paths.<ref name="DWExplorerHandbook" /> Much of the land became poisonous marshes, and at least one destroyed town never recovered and remains in ruins.<ref name=manual56/>

The following day, Erdrick arrived at Tantegel Castle to speak with King Lorik and offered his help to defeat the Dragonlord. After searching the land for clues to the Dragonlord's location, Erdrick found that the Dragonlord lived on an island that could be accessed only via a magical bridge that only a Rainbow Drop could generate. After venturing to the island, Erdrick disappeared.<ref name="DWExplorerHandbook" /> Many years later, during King Lorik&nbsp;XVI's reign,<ref name=manual56/> the Dragonlord attacked the kingdom again and captured Princess Gwaelin.<ref name="DWExplorerHandbook" /> Many heroes tried and failed to rescue the princess and recover the Ball of Light from the Dragonlord's castle, called Charlock. The prophet Mahetta predicted that "One day, a descendant of the valiant Erdrick shall come forth to defeat the Dragonlord."<ref name=manual56/> However, when the descendant arrives as the game's hero, many of the people of Alefgard have forgotten the story of Erdrick, and those few who do remember consider it a myth and do not believe in Mahetta's prophecy. King Lorik starts to mourn the decline of his kingdom.<ref name=DWSG4>{{cite book |title=Dragon Warrior: Strategy Guide |first=Tsutomu |last=Otsuka |editor1-first=Ani |editor1-last=Orimo |editor2-first=Tomy |editor2-last=Yazawa |others=Terado, Katsuya; Imai, Shuji. illustrators. |publisher=Nintendo of America |year=1989 |oclc=30018721 |location=Redmond, WA | page=4}}</ref>

===Main story===
The game begins when the player assumes the role of a stranger who arrives at Tantegel Castle. A castle guard tells him that a dragon has captured the princess and is holding her captive in a distant cave.<ref>{{cite book |section=Tantegel Castle – Before You Leave the Castle |title=Dragon Warrior Explorer's Handbook |url=http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Wiki/images/d/d6/Dragon_Warrior_-_NES_-_Explorer%27s_Handbook.pdf |url-access=limited |publisher=Nintendo of America |location=Redmond, WA |year=1989 |id=NES-DQA-USA |page=[https://archive.org/details/dragonwarriorexp00libg/page/n8 7]}}</ref> Determined to rescue the princess and defeat the Dragonlord, he discovers an ancient tablet hidden inside a desert cave; carved on the tablet is a message from Erdrick that outlines what the hero needs to do to follow in Erdrick's footsteps and defeat the Dragonlord.<ref name="DWExplorerHandbook" /> The hero eventually rescues Princess Gwaelin, but realizes that in order to restore light to Alefgard, he must defeat the Dragonlord at Charlock Castle. After the hero collects a series of relics, he creates a bridge to reach Charlock and fights his way through the castle before finally confronting the Dragonlord. At this point the hero is given a [[Dialog tree|dialogue choice]] – to side with the Dragonlord or to challenge him. If players choose the former, the game ends, the hero is put to sleep, and the game [[Hang (computing)|freezes]];<ref name=kurt/> however, in the GBC remake, the hero instead wakes up from a bad dream. If the player chooses to fight, a final battle between the hero and the Dragonlord commences.<ref name="DWExplorerHandbook" /><ref name="Guide 30">{{cite book |title=Dragon Warrior&nbsp;I&nbsp;&&nbsp;II Official Strategy Guide |publisher=Prima Publishing |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-7615-3157-9 |year=2000 |page=30}}</ref>

Once the hero defeats the Dragonlord he reclaims the Ball of Light, eradicating all monsters in Alefgard, and triumphantly returns to Tantegel Castle where King Lorik offers his kingdom as a reward. The hero turns down the offer and instead wishes to find his own kingdom. Accompanied by Princess Gwaelin, the hero then sets off in search of a new land; this sets the stage for the events in ''Dragon Warrior II'', which take place many years later and tells the story of three of the hero's descendants.<ref name="DWExplorerHandbook" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Dragon Warrior&nbsp;I&nbsp;&&nbsp;II Official Strategy Guide |publisher=Prima Publishing |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-7615-3157-9 |year=2000 |page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |section=The Story of ''Dragon Warrior'' | title=Dragon Warrior II: Instruction Booklet |year=1990 |publisher=[[Enix]] |location=Redmond, WA |id=NES-D2-USA |page=5}}</ref>

The populace thinks his claim of the ability to defeat the Dragonlord are preposterous; however, King Lorik sees this ability, which give him hope and he aids the hero on his quest.<ref name=DWSG5/>

===Background===
When Eidansha Boshu Service Center was founded in 1975 it published [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines that advertised real estate. In 1982, after failing to establish a chain of stores, the company's founder [[Yasuhiro Fukushima]] transformed it into a software company devoted to gaming and created [[Enix]]. To find talent for the company, Fukushima held the "Enix Game Hobby Program Contest". The competition was styled after manga competitions, was advertised in computer and manga magazines, and had a {{JPY|1}}&nbsp;million prize for the winners. The winners were {{nihongo|[[Kazuro Morita]]|森田和郎}}, [[Koichi Nakamura]], and manga magazine ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump|Shōnen Jump]]'' writer Yuji Horii, who was the top winner. Horii designed a tennis game, ''[[Love Match Tennis]]'', which became Enix's first release. While he did not believe he would win, he was motivated by his editor, who enjoyed the games and published Horii's articles on them.

The original idea for what became ''Dragon Quest'' came during the development of the 1985 NES port of ''Portopia''. Horii and Nakamura discovered the RPG ''[[Wizardry]]'' at a [[Macworld Conference & Expo]]. It had some influence on the NES ''Portopia''{{'}}s [[dungeon crawl]] segments, and Horii liked its depth and visuals. He wanted to create a game similar to ''Wizardry'', to expose Japan to the mainly Western-dominated RPG genre, and to expand the genre beyond computer enthusiasts.<ref name=PowerUp/><ref name="1UP.com" /> Horii also cited ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' as an inspiration for ''Dragon Quest''{{'}}s gameplay,<ref name="EGM">{{cite magazine|last1=Johnston |first1=Chris |last2=Ricciardi |first2=John|last3=Ohbuchi|first3=Yotaka |date=December 1, 2001|title=Role-Playing&nbsp;101: ''Dragon Warrior''|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |publisher=Sendai Publications |location=[[Lombard, IL]]|issn=1058-918X |oclc=23857173|pages=48–51 }}</ref><ref name="np238_84" /> specifically the [[First person (video games)|first-person]] [[Random encounter|random battles]] in ''Wizardry'' and the [[overhead perspective]] of ''Ultima''.<ref name=kurt/> Though the RPG genre was predominantly Western and limited to [[Personal computer|PC]]s, Japanese gamers enjoyed home-grown games such as ''[[The Black Onyx]]'' and the [[Dragon Slayer (series)|''Dragon Slayer'' series]] alongside Western RPG ports. However, while Horii and Nakamura enjoyed the dungeon crawling and statistical nature of ''Wizardry'', they realized most people would not. This had not originally been a concern, but the success of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' greatly increased the potential audience of any new Famicom or NES game. To create ''Dragon Quest'', the gameplay needed to be simplified.<ref name=PowerUp/> According to Horii: "There was no keyboard, and the system was much simpler, using just a [game] controller. But I still thought that it would be really exciting for the player to play as their alter ego in the game. I personally was playing ''Wizardry'' and ''Ultima'' at the time, and I really enjoyed seeing my own self in the game."<ref name="1UP.com" />

In order to create an RPG that would appeal to a wide audience unfamiliar with the genre, and video games in general, Horii wanted to create a new kind of RPG that did not rely on previous experience with the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' tabletop RPG, did not require hundreds of hours of rote fighting, and could appeal to any kind of gamer. To accomplish this he needed to simplify the system and have players associate themselves with the hero.<ref name=PowerUp/><ref name="npinterview">{{cite magazine|last=Horii|first=Yuji|author-link=Yuji Horii|issue=221|date=November 2007|magazine=Nintendo Power| title=Nintendo Power | publisher=[[Future US]]|location=[[South San Francisco, CA]]|issn=1041-9551|pages=78–80|quote=At the time I first made ''Dragon Quest'', computer and video game RPGs were still very much in the realm of hardcore fans and not very accessible to other players.

He developed a coming-of-age tale that audiences could relate to and made use of RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this.<ref name="Gotemba-Iwamoto"/>

===Japanese development===
Yuji Horii and his team at Chunsoft began developing ''Dragon Quest'' in 1985.<ref name=Essential50>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-dragon-warrior|title=20.

Horii knew that RPGs had a steeper learning curve than other video games, and to compensate for this he implemented quick level-ups at the start of the game with a clear final goal that is visible from the world map's starting point: the Dragonlord's castle. He provided a series of smaller scenarios in order to build up the player's strength to achieve the final objective.<ref name="Iwata Asks: History"/> He created an [[open world]] which is not blocked physically in any way except by monsters that can easily kill unprepared players; [[Gamasutra]] described this as one of the earliest examples of [[nonlinear gameplay]]. Horii used bridges to signify changes in difficulty and implemented a level progression with a high starting growth rate that decelerates over time, which contrasts with the random initial stats and constant growth rates of the early editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons''.<ref name="harris_dq">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1902/game_design_essentials_20_open_.php?page=8 |author=Harris, John |title=Game Design Essentials: 20 Open World Games |page=8 |website=Gamasutra |date=September 26, 2007 |access-date=January 31, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219100056/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1902/game_design_essentials_20_open_.php?page=8 |archive-date=February 19, 2011 }}</ref> To appeal to a larger audience, manga artist and creator of ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', [[Akira Toriyama]], was hired.<ref name=PowerUp/><ref>{{cite web |title=Top 100 Game Creators of All Time – 74.

[[Koichi Sugiyama]], the game's music composer, solicited Enix via a PC game's feedback questionnaire.

Initial sales of the game were so low that Enix was going to lose money, but several ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump|Shonen Jump]]'' articles by Horii helped increase its sales substantially. People liked Toriyama's artwork and Sugiyama's music, which the book ''Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life'' said "was richer and more exciting than any game music had ever sounded".<ref name=PowerUp/> In Japan, 1.5 million copies of the original version were sold.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/news/71808/full/ | title=ドラクエ9、シリーズ最高415万本出荷 | language=Japanese | work=Oricon News | date=December 21, 2009 | access-date=March 21, 2021}}</ref> More than {{nowrap|1 million}} of those copies were sold within the first six months.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Iwamoto |first1=Yoshiyuki |title=Japan on the Upswing: Why the Bubble Burst and Japan's Economic Renewal |date=2006 |publisher=Algora Publishing |isbn=978-0-87586-463-1 |page=201 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUUehPO7CdwC&pg=PA201}}</ref> It was very successful there and launched a popular series with several spin-off series and stand-alone games.

Several years after the Japanese release, the first English version of ''Dragon Warrior'' was initially seen as a commercial failure,<ref name="1UP-flops" /> but the ''Nintendo Power'' subscription giveaway was eventually a success and allowed Enix to bring the next three games to North America.

In the ''Nintendo Power''{{'}}s November&nbsp;2010 issue, in celebration of the NES's 25th anniversary in North America, Horii recalled the making of ''Dragon Warrior''. Horii was a fan of basic RPG mechanics, and wanted to simplify the interfaces; he said that many other RPGs' interfaces at the time "were so complicated that they intimidated new users". He said that ''Dragon Quest''{{'}}s simplified gameplay made the game appealing to people and made the franchise successful. He had been told that the Famicom lacks sufficient capacity for RPGs, which further motivated him to make one.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Horii |first=Yuji |title=25 Years of the NES |magazine=Nintendo Power |issue=260 |publisher=Future US |location=South San Francisco, CA |issn=1041-9551 |date=November 2010 |page=50}}</ref>
