[[File:Zub gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay]]
In ''Zub'', [[Private (rank)|Private]] Zub, is tasked by the King Zub to reclaim the Green Eyeball of Zub from his brother. Private Zub, having never been in combat for 478 years, is promoted to [[Sergeant]] and sent off to make his way to planet Zub 10.<ref name="Instructions">{{cite book|title=Zub Instruction Manual|publisher=[[Mastertronic]]|date=1986}}</ref>

Controlling the mission bound Zub, the player must travel through the Zub system, from planets Zub 1 to 10, to retrieve the crown jewel and return it.

==Development==
''Zub'' was developed by [[Ste and John Pickford]].<ref name="RetroG">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|title=The Making of Zub|author=Retro Gamer|pages=36â€“38|issue=86|url=https://archive.org/details/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_086/page/n35/mode/2up}}</ref> It was originally titled ''[[wiktionary:Special:Search/zob#French|Zob]]'' but was changed due to it being a slang term in French.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|title=Future Shocks|date=January 1987|page=12|issue=13|url=https://archive.org/stream/YourSinclair37Jan89/YourSinclair/YourSinclair13-Jan87#page/n13/mode/1up/}}</ref> It was released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] computers under [[Mastertronic]]'s M.A.D (Mastertronic's Added Dimension) imprint.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|title=Preview|date=December 1986|page=158|issue=35|url=https://archive.org/stream/crash-magazine-35/Crash_35_Dec_1986#page/n157/mode/1up}}</ref> [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]] composed the music for the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/zub/|title=Zub|last=Dodd|first=Martin|work=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=6 October 2008|access-date=28 November 2020}}</ref> The inclusion of the ''Lightfarce'' came from the brothers frustrations with the positive press ''[[Light Force]]'' was receiving. It took the brothers two and a half day to create the game. Believing it to be unreleaseable, it was included in ''Zub'' at the end of its development cycle as an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]].<ref name="RetroG"/>

Originally meant to be a twelve week project, the game ended up taking sixteen to twenty weeks to complete.<ref name="RetroG"/> Due to delay, Mastertronic released the game compatible with the [[ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_16K/48K|ZX Spectrum 48K]], lacking in features such as animated sequences. Mastertronic later released a [[ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_128|128K version]] and offered customers who bought the 48K a free copy of the enhanced version.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|title=Killer Insect Horror|date=June 1987|page=10|issue=41|url=https://archive.org/stream/crash-magazine-41/Crash_41_Jun_1987#page/n9/mode/1up/}}</ref>

''[[Zzap!64]]'' described the game as "a glamorous but tedious clone of ''[[Frogger]]''.<ref name="Z64"/> Richard Bradbury from ''[[Commodore User]]'' criticized its sound effects and over called it "a rather weak and repetitive game" that had little or no appeal.<ref name="Commodore"/>
