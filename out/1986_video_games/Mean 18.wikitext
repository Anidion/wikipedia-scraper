'''''Mean 18''''' is a [[golf]] video game designed by Rex Bradford with graphics by George Karalias, both of Microsmiths, and released by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] for [[MS-DOS]] compatible operating systems in 1986. It was ported to the [[Amiga]], [[Apple IIGS]],  [[Atari ST]], and [[Macintosh]]. It includes an editor allowing players to create their own courses. In 1989, [[Atari Corporation]] published a port for the [[Atari 7800]] console. A version for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was in development in 1989 but was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reichert |first=Matt |title=Mean 18 |website=AtariProtos.com |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/8bit/software/mean18/mean18.htm |accessdate=September 19, 2014}}</ref>

''Mean 18'' includes the Augusta National and [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach]] and [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|St. Andrews]] courses. It uses a 3-click control system, where the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade.

There are Beginner and Expert difficulty options. The Expert mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click more crucial. The player can also choose between regular and professional tees. For the Beginner mode, the program automatically recommends the best club. Using the Expert mode, the program still recommends clubs, but not necessarily the best one for the shot or places the golfer in line with the pin.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' cited the practice green, the computer caddy, and course editor as reasons for preferring the Amiga version of ''Mean 18'' to the also-"outstanding" ''[[Leader Board]]''.{{r|wagner198612}} ''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'' gave the Amiga version four stars out of five, stating "If you're a golfer, you'll like Mean 18" but criticizing the "blocky IBM-style graphics. Complete [[video game porting|Amigatization]] would solve a lot of the problems".<ref name="info198701amiga">{{Cite magazine |last1=Dunnington |first1=Benn |last2=Brown |first2=Mark R. |last3=Malcolm |first3=Tom |date=January–February 1987 |title=Amiga Gallery |url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n89/mode/2up |magazine=Info |pages=90–95}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' listed it in May 1988 as one of "Our Favorite Games", praising the graphics, sound, realism, and course editor.<ref name="compute198805">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_096_1988_May#page/n13/mode/2up | title=Our Favorite Games | work=Compute! | date=May 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | pages=12}}</ref>
