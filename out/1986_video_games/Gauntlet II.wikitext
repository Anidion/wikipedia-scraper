'''''Gauntlet II''''' is a [[1986 in video gaming|1986]] [[arcade game]] produced by [[Atari Games]] that serves as the immediate sequel to the original ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'', which was released the previous year.  Like its predecessor, ''Gauntlet II'' is a [[fantasy]]-themed top down [[dungeon crawl]]er game and was released as a dedicated cabinet, as well as a conversion kit, both available in 2-player and 4-player versions.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:ARC Gauntlet_II.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]

''Gauntlet II'' is essentially an expanded version of the original ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)#Gameplay|Gauntlet]]''. Like in the original game, there are four character classes to play as, with the choices being Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard and Elf. The main difference from the original game is that multiple players can now choose to play as the same character class. Because of this each player is now distinguished by the palette of their character, with red and blue being in all versions of the game, while yellow and green are featured in the 4-player version. New voice samples were added in ''Gauntlet II'', identifying each player by their color and class (e.g. "Yellow Elf", "Red Wizard").

New level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the play-field turned in steps of 90°. Other new features include the enemy "It", which upon contact made a player "It" and drew all enemies towards them. The only way to release this curse is by [[Tag (game)|touching another player]] or entering the exit, turning any level containing "It" into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special [[power-up|pick-up]], acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which occupied multiple squares and required multiple hits to destroy.<ref name=ahistory>{{cite web | url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=gauntlet&page=detail&id=939 | title=Gauntlet II The Arcade Video Game by Atari Games Corp. | publisher=Arcade History}}</ref>

New level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included "all walls are invisible", "magic walls" which changed into monsters or items when hit, "stun tiles" which stunned the player, and fake exits.

Another challenge in the game is the possibility to find a "secret room". This can be found by completing specific achievements within the level (e.g., "don't be fooled", means that you must find the real exit first). The secret room contains items such as food and magic potions (extra shot power, extra shot speed, extra magic power, extra speed, extra armor and extra fight power).

==Development==
Shortly after the release of the original ''Gauntlet'', until March 31, 1986, Atari Games held a contest where players submitted level designs, game ideas, and other suggestions for a potential ''Gauntlet'' sequel.<ref name=agpc1>{{cite magazine|magazine=Atari Games Players Journal|title=Gauntlet Maze Design Contest|date=January 1986|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.atarimania.com/mags/pdf/atari-games-players-club-vol-01-number-01.pdf}}</ref><ref name=cashbox>{{cite magazine|magazine=Cash Box|title='Gauntlet' Contest Announced|date=February 1, 1986|url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox49unse_31/page/38}}</ref> The winners of the contest were announced in the April 1986 issue of Atari Games' newsletter,<ref name=agpc2>{{cite magazine|magazine=Atari Games Players Journal|title=Gauntlet Maze Design Contest|date=April 1986|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.atarimania.com/mags/pdf/atari-games-players-club-vol-01-number-02.pdf}}</ref> and the developers implemented some of those submissions in ''Gauntlet II''. During the release of ''Gauntlet II'', Atari Games held a second contest where players were tasked to find the secret rooms in the game itself. After fulfilling a certain task, the players were given a code, which they submitted to Atari Games via an entry form; the grand prize was a U.S. government saving bond valued at $5000, and the first 500 entries received a t-shirt. The contest was held until December 19.<ref name=agpc3/><ref name=cashbox860913>{{cite magazine|magazine=Cash Box|title=It's A Brand New Game: Gauntlet II|date=September 13, 1986|url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox50unse_7/page/34}}</ref>

==Releases==
''Gauntlet II'' was ported to the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[MS-DOS]] in 1987. These versions of the game were released in North America by [[Mindscape (software publisher)|Mindscape]] and in Europe by [[U.S. Gold]]. Most versions only supported two players, but the Atari ST version supported an adaptor that allowed two further joysticks (totalling four) to be connected via that machine's [[parallel port]]. Mindscape later ported the game to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990 and the [[Game Boy]] in 1991. The NES version of ''Gauntlet II'' was one of the earliest games for the console that supported up to four players, being compatible with either the [[NES Four Score]] or [[NES Satellite]] adapters.<ref name=np19>{{cite magazine|magazine=Nintendo Power|title=Gauntlet II|issue=19|pages=25–36|date=December 1990}}</ref> Unlike the NES version of the first ''Gauntlet'', ''Gauntlet II'' was a more direct conversion of the arcade original, lacking any sort of storyline or ending.

''Gauntlet II'' is also included in the compilations ''[[Midway Arcade Treasures 2]]'' (released for [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[GameCube]] in 2004) and ''[[Midway Arcade Origins]]'' (released for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2012).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/14/midway-arcade-origins-review | title=Squeezing 30 fridge-sized games onto a disc proves difficult |date=November 13, 2012 |publisher=ign.com}}</ref> A stand-alone port of the game was also released by [[Sony Online Entertainment]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] on May 3, 2007 as a downloadable game on the [[PlayStation Store]], but has since been delisted.

The Game Boy version was praised by the German ''Play Time'' magazine for its technical implementation (including 8-directional scrolling), faithful recreation of graphics, and for evoking nostalgic feelings with similar sound effects; however, this version was criticized for difficult-to-recognize sprites and its technically weak theme music.<ref name=playtime/>

The Spectrum version of the game was well received, ''Sinclair User'' said it was "a corker. Fast action and superb gameplay make ''Gauntlet II'' probably the first sequel worth the cash". ''Your Sinclair'' said it was "a 'must have' for all of you who asked for Gauntlet on your Desert Island Disks". Both ''YS'' and ''Crash'' gave the main weaknesses as the sound and the over-similarity to the original.

In 1997 ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' listed ''Gauntlet II'' as the 3rd best arcade game of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The 10 Best Arcade Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=130}}</ref>
