'''''Jewels of Darkness''''' is a trilogy of [[text adventure]] games by [[Level 9 Computing|Level 9]]. The individual games were initially released separately in 1982. They featured some themes and names inspired by the books of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and so became known as the ''[[Middle-earth|Middle-Earth]] Trilogy''. The individual releases were available for the [[BBC Micro]] unlike the compilation.

In 1986 the three games were revised, expanded and rereleased together as a compilation. For legal reasons the references to Middle Earth were removed and the trilogy was retitled ''Jewels of Darkness''. The games include simple static graphics.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that the compilation's claim that the games had been "significantly revised to incorporate the latest innovative techniques" was false. It described the puzzles as illogical, the Commodore version's graphics as "crude", and, like the parser, below the standard of previous Firebird text adventures.<ref name="seacat198802">{{cite magazine | title=Jewels of Darkness | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=44 | date=February 1988 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=44 | access-date=24 April 2016 | last=Seacat | first=Douglas | pages=23, 26}}</ref>

"[The graphics are] colourful but they're not great works of art. And the location descriptions and scenarios have always struck me as being good enough on their own."<br>
