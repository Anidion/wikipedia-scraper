==Reception==
{{Video game reviews
| award1Pub = ''Crash''
| award1 = Smash<ref>Game review, Crash magazine, [[Newsfield Publications]], issue 34, November 1986</ref>
}}
''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' awarded ''Fat Worm'' 95%.<ref>[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/34/fatworm.htm CRASH issue 34], November 1986, at CRASH Online</ref> The reviewers were impressed with the solid 3D graphics and the quirky nature of controlling the protagonist, concluding "extremely silly, and wonderful fun". ''[[Your Sinclair]]'', similarly impressed, scored 9 out of 10 and a Megagame award.<ref>[http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/fatworm.htm Your Sinclair issue 13] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083906/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/fatworm.htm |date=2007-09-29 }} at the Your Sinclair Rock 'n' Roll Years</ref>  Julian later became critical of the gameplay, stating that kid programmers like himself had "insufficient understanding" and that at the time "it seemed logical that the players ought to suffer" as much as the developers; but that feedback from players in the form of [[PEEK and POKE#POKEs as cheats|pokes and cheats]] often enhanced published games to make them fun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goatchurch.org.uk/progs/fatworm/fatworm.html |title=Fat Worm Blows a Sparky |author=Julian Todd |author-link=Julian Todd |date=29 March 2003 |accessdate=2007-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928094115/http://www.goatchurch.org.uk/progs/fatworm/fatworm.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}</ref>
