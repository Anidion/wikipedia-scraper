It is based on the ''[[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]]'' toyline.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.takaratomy.co.jp/products/gamesoft/blog/i0300/post_46.html|script-title=ja:『トランスフォーマー・コンボイの謎』でレッツトラウマ|trans-title=Let's trauma in ''Transformers: Mystery of Convoy''|date= 2008-06-06|access-date= 2009-02-27|publisher= [[Takara Tomy]]|language= ja|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120217095202/http://www.takaratomy.co.jp/products/gamesoft/blog/i0300/post_46.html|archive-date=2012-02-17 }}</ref> The game was made available on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service on June 10, 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_tf/index.html|title= VC トランスフォーマー コンボイの謎|trans-title=Virtual Console - ''Transformers: Mystery of Convoy''|access-date= 2009-02-27|publisher= Nintendo|language= ja}}</ref>

The game stars [[Autobot]] protagonist [[Ultra Magnus]]. The titular ''Mystery'' is the identity of Optimus Prime's (referred to in the title as "Convoy") killer, as the [[The Transformers: The Movie|1986 film]] did not see a Japanese release for another four years.{{fact|date=December 2023}} Thus, Optimus Prime's death was not adequately explained to the Japanese audience; this game was intended to capitalize on that gap.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Ultra Magnus, who must shoot his way through 10 horizontally and vertically scrolling levels consisting of various [[Decepticon]] enemies, with a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight at the end of each level. He can transform into a car carrier, which makes it easier for him to avoid enemy attacks, drive through narrow entrances and shoot enemies that are flying above him. Along the way, he can also pick up various [[power-up]]s which can give him wider ranging firepower or even the ability to fly. There are two [[Warp (video games)|Warp Zones]] within the game; they can be found by rescuing [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] from the Decepticons.

The bosses for each level consist of mostly large Decepticon symbols in different color palettes. The only Deceptions Ultra Magnus actually fights are Megatron, who for unexplained reasons is the penultimate boss, and [[Trypticon]] (known in Japan as Dinosaurer), the final boss.<ref name=1up>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3160736 |title=Robots in Disgust |last=Oxford |first=Nadia |page=2 |date=2007-03-07 |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] |access-date=2014-06-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305062613/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3160736 |archive-date=March 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Another playable character in the game is [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]], who can be unlocked by collecting the letters that spell Rodimus. One is hidden, sequentially, in levels 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. However, though his vehicle mode has its own graphics, his robot-mode [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] is Ultra Magnus in Rodimus's palette.

===Smartphone app===
The studio [[DLE (company)|DLE]] also produced a smartphone app, titled {{nihongo|''Q Transformers: Return of the Mystery of Convoy''|キュートランスフォーマー 帰ってきたコンボイの謎|Kyū Toransufōmā Kaettekita Konboi no Nazo}}, which was released for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in August 2014.<ref name="animenewsnetwork.com"/> This was a remake of the original game using Q Transformers [[Optimus Prime]] and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] as playable characters instead of [[Ultra Magnus]] and [[Rodimus Prime]]. Like the original, it is quite difficult but serves as an endless runner game instead of the platformer style of the original. This was a Japanese app store exclusive, but the servers have been shut down since its release.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.appspy.com/news/8947/transformers-nes-game-returns-as-q-transformers-mystery-of-the-returned-convoy-on-ios-and-android | title=Transformers NES game returns as Q Transformers: Mystery of the Returned Convoy on iOS and Android}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Transformers: Mystery of Convoy'' is known for its high difficulty level and poor stage design, resulting in a largely negative reception both at release and retrospectively.<ref name="FCM">{{cite news |title=5月10日号特別付録 ファミコンロムカセット オールカタログ |agency=Family Computer Magazine |issue=9 |publisher=[[Tokuma Shoten]] |date=May 10, 1991 |volume=7 |page=82 |language=ja}}</ref><ref name="Lambie">{{cite web |last1=Lambie |first1=Ryan |title=Transformers: Mystery of Convoy Might be the Most Cynical Licensed Video Game Ever Made |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/games/transformers-mystery-of-convoy-might-be-the-most-cynical-licensed-video-game-ever-made/ |website=[[Den of Geek]] |publisher=Den of Geek World |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607202834/https://www.denofgeek.com/games/transformers-mystery-of-convoy-might-be-the-most-cynical-licensed-video-game-ever-made/ |archive-date=June 7, 2020 |date=February 13, 2018}}</ref><ref name="RGamer">{{cite web |author1=Retro Gamer Staff |title=Transformers: Convoy no Nazo (Transformers: Mystery of Convoy) |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/transformers-convoy-no-nazo-transformers-mystery-of-convoy/ |website=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |access-date=October 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913083230/https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/transformers-convoy-no-nazo-transformers-mystery-of-convoy/ |archive-date=September 13, 2015 |date=February 11, 2010}}</ref> ''[[1UP.com]]'' called it the "perfect example of a shameless tie-in." They criticized the game for its high level of difficulty, the game's implementation of the transforming ability and how the ninth stage loops infinitely unless a specific pattern is followed.<ref name=1up/>
