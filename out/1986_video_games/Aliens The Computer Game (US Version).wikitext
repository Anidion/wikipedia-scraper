===Retrospective===
''[[VentureBeat]]''{{'}}s Stephen Kleckner commented in a 2014 feature that "as with a lot of compilation-designed titles, Aliens falls into that trap of being a collection of mediocre experiences instead of a game with a singular focus. […] Hardcore fans who own a Commodore 64 should load this one up. Everyone else isn’t missing much that a [[Let's Play]] video won't provide."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/06/games-of-the-alien-franchise-part-1-the-bad-the-canceled-and-the-weirdly-cool/ |title=Games of the Alien franchise, Part 1: The bad, the canceled, and the weirdly cool &#124; GamesBeat &#124; Games &#124; by Stephen Kleckner |publisher=Venturebeat.com |date=2014-10-06 |access-date=2015-07-17}}</ref> On the other hand, Chris Cummins from [[Village Voice Media|Topless Robot]] wrote in 2010 that "the now-crude graphics aside, it's still arguably the best game based on any of the films in the ''Alien'' saga."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2010/05/the_15_greatest_sci-fihorror_games_for_the_commodo.php?page=2 | title=The 15 Greatest Sci-Fi/Horror Games for the Commodore 64 | date=19 May 2010 }}</ref>
