Lost body heat can be restored by moving into a heated igloo.

==Reception==
Matthew J.W. Ratcliff for ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' said "First Star Software has done an excellent job of bring the ''Mad Magazine'' classic Spy vs. Spy comics to life in Arctic Antics."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/analog-computing-magazine-65|title=Analog Computing Magazine Issue 65 (Whats new at CES)|date=October 25, 1988|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Ervin Bobo for ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' said "As a new grouping, Maxx-Out is off to a good start with its initial selection."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/1988-03-computegazette|title=Compute! Gazette Issue 57|date=March 25, 1988|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Bill Scolding for ''[[Commodore User]]'' said "''Arctic Antics'' is by far and away the weakest of the three Spy games and you might wonder just how much longer the First Star programming team can get away with churning out what are essentially very similar games."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Commodore_User_Magazine_Issue_046|title=Commodore User Magazine Issue 046|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Paul Rixon for ''[[Page 6]]'' said "If you're a fan of the previous Spy vs Spy titles you will be overjoyed with Arctic Antics since it has all the charm, challenge, fun and addictiveness of its predecessors."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Page6-46-Oct90|title=Page6 46 Oct90|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
