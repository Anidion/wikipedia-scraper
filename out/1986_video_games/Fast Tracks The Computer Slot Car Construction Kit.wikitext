[[File:FastTracksScreenshotC64.jpg|thumb|Screenshot]]
The game involves running into other cars on the track. Each time a player bumps another car off the track, the car returns to the start of the lap, and two seconds are removed from the final time. If the player leaves the track they will have to restart the lap.<ref name="mobygames"/>

A map editor is also available in the game, which can be saved onto the disc.<ref name="mobygames">[http://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/fast-tracks-the-computer-slot-car-construction-kit ''Fast Tracks: The Computer Slot Car Construction Kit''] at [[MobyGames]]</ref> Seven circuits are built-in.<ref name="mobygames"/>

==Reception==
Roy Wagner reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and wrote that "race tracks, that you create, can be sent to friends who don't even have the game. They can then try to beat your best times. This game offers a lot of variety and plays nicely. It comes in a close third to the ''Racing Destruction Set'' from EA and ''Pole Position''".<ref name="CGW26">{{cite magazine |last=Wagner |first=Roy |title=The Commodore Key |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=March 1986 |volume=1 |issue=26 |pages=38}}</ref>
