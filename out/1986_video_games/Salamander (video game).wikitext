{{nihongo|'''''Salamander'''''|{{ruby-ja|沙羅曼蛇|サラマンダ}}|Saramanda}}, retitled {{nihongo|'''''Life Force'''''|ライフフォース|Raifu Fōsu}} in [[North America]] and in the Japanese arcade [[#Development|re-release]], is a [[Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Konami]]. Released in 1986 as a spin-off of ''[[Gradius]]'', ''Salamander'' introduced a simplified power-up system, two-player cooperative gameplay and both horizontally and vertically scrolling stages. Some of these later became normal for future ''Gradius'' games. In Japanese, the title is written using [[ateji]], which are [[kanji]] used for spelling foreign words that has been supplanted in everyday use by [[katakana]]. ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]'', another game by Konami was also given this treatment, with its title written in Japanese as {{nihongo|魂斗羅|kontora}}.

''Salamander'' was followed with a sequel in 1996 titled ''[[Salamander 2]]''.

==Gameplay==
The first player controls [[Vic Viper]] and the second player takes the reins of debuting spacecraft Lord British, which is sometimes referred to as "Road British" due to the ambiguity of Japanese-to-English [[romanization]]. The game features six stages which alter between horizontal and vertical scrolling.

Players are allowed to continue from where they leave upon death instead of being returned to a predefined checkpoint as per ''Gradius'' tradition. There are no continues in [[single player]] mode, and two in the two-player mode. The number of continues can be changed through DIP switches. The player gains [[power-up]]s by picking up capsules left behind by certain enemies, as opposed to the [[Gradius|selection bar]] used in other ''Gradius'' games. However, the Japanese version of ''Life Force'' keeps the selection bar.

Many of the power-ups can be combined. For example, an option fires a second (or third) salvo of missiles or ripple/plutonic lasers if these power-ups have been attained. The ripple and laser, however, are mutually exclusive. The only power-up that can survive the ship's destruction is the options (called "multiples" in the English release), they followed the exact flight path of the player's ship and fired when they did, but were otherwise invulnerable. Upon the ship's destruction, the options float in space for a brief time before disappearing; the new ship can grab and retain them.

==Development==
The arcade version of the game was released under its original title in Japan and Europe, and as ''Life Force'' in North America. The Japanese and European versions are nearly identical, but the American version changes the game's plot by adding an opening text that establishes the game to be set inside a giant [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] life-form which is infected by a strain of [[bacteria]]. Stages that feature starfield [[Wallpaper (computing)|backgrounds]] were changed to the web background from Stage 1 to maintain consistency with the organic setting of the plot. The power-ups are also given different names, with the "Speed-Up" becoming "Hyper Speed", the "Missile" becoming the "Destruct Missile", the "Ripple Laser" becoming the "Pulse Laser" and "Force Field" becoming the "Shield". Narration is added to the beginning of each stage, detailing the area of the alien's body which the player is currently inhabiting such as "Enter stomach muscle zone" or "Bio-mechanical brain attack".

Konami later released an enhanced version of ''Salamander'' in Japan in 1987 bearing the American title of ''Life Force'' which further fleshes out the organic motif. All of the backgrounds and mechanical enemies are completely redrawn and given organic appearances. The power-up system was also modified, with the Japanese ''Life Force'' using the same power-up gauge as the original ''Gradius''. Some music tracks have been completely changed for this release and the power-up gauge is arranged differently for both players.

==Ports==

===Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum===
[[Ocean Software]] on their Imagine label, released licensed versions of ''Salamander'' for computer systems by Spectrum, Commodore and Amstrad in 1988. The Spectrum and Amstrad versions were generally criticized, but the Commodore 64 version was highly praised by the critics of the day, particularly ''[[Zzap!64]]''. Though missing two of the six stages, the simultaneous two player mode and gameplay being much easier than its arcade counterpart, the Commodore port is generally considered to be one of the best arcade conversions on this system.

===Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System===
''Salamander'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in Japan in 1987. Instead of being a direct port of ''Salamander'', elements were taken from the original ''Salamander'' and the Japanese ''Life Force'' re-release, and some elements, such as levels and bosses, were removed to make way for new content. Most of the background graphics and enemy sprites from ''Salamander'' are used in favor of those used in ''Life Force'', though the ''Gradius''-style power bar is used in place of the original instant pick-up system. In 1988, North America received a port as well for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The NES version is practically identical to its Famicom equivalent, other than not having the multiple endings, having two option power ups instead of three, and being titled ''Life Force''. The North America version was later re-released for the [[Virtual Console]] on February 16, 2009 for the [[Wii]],<ref>{{cite news|title=One WiiWare Game and One Virtual Console Game Added (and One Surprise Coming) to Wii Shop Channel|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/MAJvPmo4G3odfJt-TGey8nBuh5CNlw6R|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=February 16, 2009|access-date=February 16, 2009}}</ref> on January 23, 2014 for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/life-force-3ds/|title = Life Force for Nintendo 3DS - Nintendo Game Details}}</ref> and August 21, 2014 for the [[Wii U]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/life-force-wii-u/|title = Life Force for Wii U - Nintendo Game Details}}</ref> The European version is titled ''Life Force: Salamander'' on its cover and was released on November 22, 1989. The NES version makes use of the [[Konami Code]], which increases the number of lives from three to 30. The first two levels of ''Life Force'' were profiled in the second issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', issued in 1988. Several issues later the entire game was re-profiled.

===MSX===
The [[MSX]] port of {{nihongo|''Salamander''|[[:ja:沙羅曼蛇 (MSX)|沙羅曼蛇]]|Saramanda}} is significantly different from the original and any other ports.  New to this port is a graphical introduction that introduces human pilots for each ship, as well as names for each stage. The levels are notably longer than the arcade original, and the player is forced to start from a pre-defined checkpoint upon death of either pilot, instead of starting where he left off. After level two, the player can choose the order of the next three stages. In addition, the player can collect "E" capsules by destroying certain enemies. Collecting fifteen will permanently upgrade one of the available weapons on the power-up bar. Some weapons allow the player ships to merge, one player controlling movements and the second player controlling weapons. Instead of the Vic Viper and the Lord British Space Destroyer, the ships are known as the Sabel Tiger and the Thrasher; piloted by human characters named Iggy Rock and Zowie Scott. The story takes place in the year 6709 A.D and has 2 different endings. The MSX version was re-released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on January 12, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/software/12.html|title = Wii &#124; Virtual Console バーチャルコンソール}}</ref> It was later released for the [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console on July 20, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000023067|title=沙羅曼蛇 &#124; Wii U &#124; 任天堂}}</ref> They were also made available for the Project EGG on Windows Store on May 19, 2015.

===PC Engine===
A version for the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] was released on December 6, 1991. Based on the arcade version of ''Salamander'', changes on this port include starting from a pre-defined checkpoint upon death in 1 Player mode, faster enemy animations, and improved music. In Japan, the PC Engine version was re-released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] on September 11, 2007, for [[PlayStation Network]] on July 21, 2010 and for the [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console on October 22, 2014, and also for the Project EGG con Windows Store on March 3, 2014. It was released in North America on November 16, 2017 for the [[Wii U Virtual Console]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/220240/20180204/konami-releases-turbografx-16-games-for-the-wii-u-even-though-its-already-2018.htm|title=Konami Releases TurboGrafx-16 Games For The Wii U, Even Though It's Already 2018|first=John|last=Diente|date=February 4, 2018|website=Tech Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.konami.com/games/ca/en/products/dl_salamander_tg_e/|title=SALAMANDER|website=Konami Product Information}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/salamander-wii-u/|title=Salamander for Wii U - Nintendo Game Details|website=www.nintendo.com}}</ref> The PC version is on the  [[TurboGrafx-16 Mini]] released in 2020 and is the sole title from the compilation that is excluded from the Japanese model while being included in the North American and European ones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/konami-releases-game-lineup-trailers-turbografx-16-mini-console-2811606|title = Konami Releases Game Lineup Trailers for TurboGrafx-16 Mini Console| website=[[International Business Times]] |date = 8 August 2019}}</ref>

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Salamander'' on their August 15, 1986 issue as being the second most successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=290|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 August 1986|page=21|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19860815p.pdf#page=11|lang=ja}}</ref> It went on to be the top-grossing arcade game on Japan's ''[[Gamest]]'' charts between September and October 1986.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=ゲーム人気度ベスト10 |trans-title=Best 10 Popular Games |magazine=[[Gamest]] |date=18 October 1986 |volume=4 (November 1986) |url=https://archive.org/details/gamest0004/page/n80/mode/1up |page=75 |lang=ja}}</ref>

In 1997, ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' rated the NES version the 76th best console video game of all time, calling it "one of the coolest shooters ever, and ... one of the first big two-player simultaneous shooters on the NES." They particularly noted that the graphics in the fire stage were "mind-blowing back in the day".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=100 Best Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=113}} Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only and U.S. releases only, thus why the arcade and PC Engine versions and ''Salamander Deluxe Pack'' are not included in the ranking though the listing mentions all of them.</ref> In 1993, ''[[Commodore Force]]'' ranked the game at number 19 on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Ton!|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-101/ZZap_64_Issue_101_Commodore_Force_Issue_11_1993_Autumn#page/n32/mode/1up/|website=Commodore Force|date=Autumn 1993|accessdate=2017-09-03|page=33}}</ref>

==Anime==
[[File:Sala-front.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Volume 1 cover]]
{{nihongo|'''''Salamander'''''|沙羅曼蛇|Saramanda}} is a 1988 [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] [[mini-series]] by [[Studio Pierrot]], directed by [[Hisayuki Toriumi]]. There were three episodes released on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] between February 25, 1988 and February 21, 1989. The series was licensed by a British company Western Connection. The series is not canon, however; as the ''MSX Gradius'' series states that the events with Gofer take place over a two-hundred year period following the crisis with Zelos and his Salamander Armada. In this mini-series, it is revealed that the Bacterians capture sentient life to create leaders for their space armada. They capture sentient life via a dark fog going through space that changes inorganic matter into organic matter (the large brain-like final bosses in the games); and that they are a crystal-like life-form in origin. [[Noriko Hidaka]] provided the voice of the protagonist Stephanie. In the anime, the Lord British Space Destroyer was named after one of the protagonists, Ike Lord British of planet Latis; thus making it Lord British's Space Destroyer.
