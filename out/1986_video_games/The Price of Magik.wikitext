John Sweeney for ''[[Page 6]]'' said "this adventure is excellent value for money. Congratulations on another great game, Level 9."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Page_6_Issue_24_1986-11_ABACUS_GB/page/n71/mode/2up|title=Page 6 - Issue 24 (1986-11)(ABACUS)(GB)|date=November 17, 1986|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Amtix]]'' said "No doubt the game will be another smashing success. It's just a pity that all their imagination seemed to be exhausted in well hidden ideas and nothing was left to beef up the plot or flavour the atmosphere."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Amtix_Magazine_Issue_09/page/n59/mode/2up|title=Amtix Magazine Issue 09|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Keith Campbell for ''[[Commodore User]]'' said "as with all Level 9 games, one can only say, 'Their best yet!'"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Commodore_User_Magazine_Issue_034/page/22/mode/2up|title=Commodore User Magazine Issue 034|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Rob Steel for ''[[The Games Machine]]'' said "There is nothing to bind the adventure together, it is simply a number of rooms containing unexciting creatures, clues to one of the 18 spells or nothing of interest."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Games_Machine_Issue_007/page/n73/mode/2up|title=The Games Machine Issue 007|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
