==Summary==
[[File:HottmanNoChiteiTankenFamicomLevel15.png|225px|left|thumb|By the final level of the game, the tasks that players must accomplish are taxing but not impossible.]]

Players get to dig up [[dirt]] beneath the surface, find [[key (lock)|key]]s behind four doors, and then find the [[door]] to the next level. The most obvious game to compare it to is ''[[Dig Dug]]'', but without the [[boulder]]s and with various devices like teleporting doors, speed, [[dynamite]], and a [[wet suit]]. There are 15 levels in the entire game; which repeat themselves after the 15th level is finished.

Lava can spew out at a vertical direction towards the player and kill him; it does not reset itself even after the players loses a life (but it does reset itself after a [[game over]]) [[Password (video gaming)|Passwords]] are activated by pressing a certain button combination on the password screen. Several passwords results in [[cheat code]]s that does certain things; such as deactivating the lava in all levels of the game.<ref>[http://www25.atwiki.jp/famicomall/pages/422.html Advanced information {{in lang|ja}}] at FC no Game Seiha Shimasho</ref>
