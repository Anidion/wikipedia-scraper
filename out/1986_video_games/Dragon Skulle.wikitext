==Gameplay==
''Dragon Skulle'' is an arcade adventure in isometric perspective pseudo-3D set on the fictional island of Dragon Skulle, where you must find and destroy the Skull of Souls.<ref name=zzap64/> The gameplay is more about exploring than puzzle solving when compared with its predecessors.<ref name="rgamer56"/>

==Reception== 
The game received a 53% rating from ''Zzap!64'' who criticised the game on the basis of poor 3D, weak sound and lack of originality.  All three reviewers expressed gratitude that it was the last in the Arthur Pendragon series.<ref name=zzap64>{{citation | title = Dragonskulle | url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=11&page=37 | journal=[[Zzap!64]] | issue=11 | pages=37 | publisher=[[Newsfield Publications]] | date=March 1986 }}</ref>

''Commodore User'''s Eugene Lacey was also unimpressed by the game, stating that the Pendragon series of games had been dragged out too long. Although this was said to be the most difficult title in the series due to "hair wrenching puzzles" it was otherwise weaker than its predecessors with poorer graphics and "appalling" animation of the lead character. Lacey concluded the review by stating that it was "A disappointing conclusion to what was a very good series of games."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/commodore-user-magazine-30/Commodore_User_Issue_30_1986_Mar#page/n21/mode/1up|title = Commodore User Magazine Issue 30|date = March 1986}}</ref>
