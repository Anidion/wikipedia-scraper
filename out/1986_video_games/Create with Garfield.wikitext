==Reception==
Eric Holroyd, in a review for the ''[[Australian Apple Review]]'', recommended the game for Garfield fans, especially if mixed with the similar game ''Teddy Bear-rels of Fun'', claiming that "The added bonus of mixing and matching the two will give endless hours of fun for you, your family and your friends".<ref name="Holroyd"/> Neil Randall, writing in [[Compute!'s Gazette]], highly recommended the software for those who enjoyed "creativity programs". He complemented the program as "useful and fun" and thought it  "impressive for its ability to get the user creating shortly after boot-up".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Randall |first=Neil  |date=September 1987 |title=Create with Garfield |url=https://archive.org/details/1987-09-computegazette/page/n43/mode/2up |magazine=Compute!'s Gazette |issue=51 |publisher=ABC Publishing |access-date=1 December 2023 |page=43}}</ref>
