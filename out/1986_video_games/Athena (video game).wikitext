{{Nihongo|'''''Athena'''''|アテナ|Atena}} is a 1986 [[Platform game|platform]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[SNK]]. [[#Ports|Conversions were later released]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] console and [[ZX Spectrum]]<ref name='spectrumcomputing' /> and [[Commodore 64]]<ref name='zzap_review' /> home computers.

The game's protagonist, Princess Athena, has gone on to appear in later [[fighting game]]s by SNK as a [[Player character|secret character]] or assistant to her descendant [[Athena Asamiya]], a frequent main character in these games.

==Plot==
Athena was the young, headstrong [[princess]] of the heavenly Kingdom of Victory. She was bored of the monotonous daily life in the [[palace]] and desired exciting adventures. One day, she opened the "Door Which Shouldn't Be Opened" in the basement of Castle Victory, said to lead to a savage and deadly place. As she dared cross the doorway, it caused her to fall from the skies and to another realm called Fantasy World, which was dominated by the evil Emperor Dante. After her flowing dress was lost while catching the wind for her fall, the perilous adventures of Princess Athena began as she landed in a [[wilderness]] overrun by beast-like warriors and more dangers than she could ever wish for. She readied to fight for her life and arm herself, with no other choice than to face the ruthless Dante and every obstacle on her way, to free this kingdom and make it back alive to her own.

After Athena defeats Dante, it all begins anew in the sequel, ''Athena: Full Throttle'', in which the princess, again bored, opens the "Door Which Shouldn't Be Opened '''B'''", disregarding her loyal maid Helene's advice, and they both fall to Elysium World, where they face off against other villains.

Many of the game's elements are inspired by [[Greek mythology]] or [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman culture]] such as weapons, equipment, items and enemy designs, while Princess Athena herself is named after the Greek goddess [[Athena]].

==Gameplay==
Upon landing, unarmed and nearly [[nudity|nude]], the princess only has her kicks to fend off the approaching [[monster]]s, but she may collect the dead enemies's various weapons and also has the chance to find [[shield]]s, headgear and [[body armor|armor]] to cover her body, although these will be lost after withstanding some attacks. Her journey requires leaping and climbing as well as fighting through the land's eight hazardous worlds, each leading up to an oversized enemy that must be dealt with before proceeding to the next area. The use of certain weapons such as a [[hammer]] allows Athena to break through stone blocks, sometimes revealing not only armor but [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] items such as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]'s sandals that, when worn, allow her to make great leaps.

The game features certain [[role-playing video game]] elements to complement the platform action. Princess Athena has to defeat enemies such as the final [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] by using various mythological weapons, items and equipment. Without some items, she cannot make it through the adventure.

== Ports ==
Athena was later [[Conversion (software)|converted]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] by [[Micronics]]. Conversions were also done for the [[ZX Spectrum]]<ref name='spectrumcomputing' /> and [[Commodore 64]]<ref name='zzap_review' /> in 1987 by [[Ocean Software]] and released under their [[Imagine Software|Imagine]] label.

The NES version was only released for [[North America]]n homes until the [[PlayStation Network]] saw a release of the arcade original in 2011. Both the arcade and NES versions of ''Athena'' are eventually included in ''[[SNK 40th Anniversary Collection]]'', released for the [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2018, and then in 2019 for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/snk-40th-anniversary-collection-review-it-belongs-/1900-6417028/|title=SNK 40th Anniversary Collection Review - It Belongs In A Museum |publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 6, 2018}}</ref>
