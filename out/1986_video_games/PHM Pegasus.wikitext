'''''PHM Pegasus''''' is a [[vehicle simulation game|ship simulation]] and action game released for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II]], [[DOS]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. The title refers to {{USS|Pegasus|PHM-1}}, one of the {{sclass|Pegasus|hydrofoil}}s which were used by the [[U.S. Navy]] in the 1970s.

The game was developed by [[Lucasfilm Games]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]].<ref name="run">{{cite journal|date=April 1987|title=''PHM Pegasus''|journal=[[Run (magazine)|RUN]]|volume=4|issue=4|pages=13|publisher=CW Communications/Peterborough|location=Peterborough, NH|issn=0741-4285|oclc=10151803}}</ref> The game has eight different missions in which [[Player character|players]] must maneuver helicopters, convoy ships, and patrol hydrofoil missilecrafts to survey areas, clear areas of enemy ships, and escort friendly ships.<ref name="run"/>

Mission locations include the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], the [[Caribbean]], and the [[Gulf of Sidra]].<ref name="run"/> The developers of the game consulted with Boeing Marine Systems, a manufacturer of [[hydrofoil]]s, to increase the realism of the simulation.<ref name="run"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Trunzo|first=James V.|date=September 1987|title=''PHM Pegasus'' Review|journal=[[Compute!]]|issue=88|pages=61|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue88/Reviews_PHM.php|access-date=2009-06-18}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:PHM_Pegasus_DOS_screenshot.png|thumb|left|DOS screenshot]]
''PHM Pegasus'' assigns players to the control of three different types of vehicles: Patrol Hydrofoil Missilecrafts (PHM), [[Seasprite]] and [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|Seahawk]] helicopters, and [[convoy]] ships. The first two missions are time-limited where the player controls a PHM and must find nearby enemy crafts using the ship's 40-mile radius radar and sink them using the ship's array of weaponry. Players can fire from a manual maneuvering screen or use a pair of binoculars to identify and aim at ships. Two missions are seek-and-destroy where the player can use two helicopters to locate enemy ships in the [[Mediterranean]] and sink them using the PHM. Another mission involves surveillance where players must navigate within 1500 feet of eight tankers suspected of carrying arms to photograph the vessels. The mission does not allow the tankers to be fired upon, so two SeaHawk helicopters must be used to scout the area before approach.

The last two are escort missions: guarding a friendly vessel to its destination. The first involves protecting a convoy as it travels to port through the [[Caribbean]]. The second and final mission of the game has the player guarding a supply ship as it makes its way through the [[Persian Gulf]] out into the [[Indian Ocean]]. Two helicopters are provided and prolonged enemy incursions must be minimized.<ref name="tgmreview">{{cite journal|date=February 1988|title=''PMS Pegasus'' Review|journal=The Games Machine|issue=3|pages=48|publisher=Newsfield|location=Ludlow, Shropshire|oclc=25958246}}</ref>

==Reception==
According to [[Noah Falstein]], ''PHM Pegasus'' was Lucasfilm Games' biggest-ever hit at the time of its release, and the company's "first 100,000+ seller".<ref name=falstein>{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010309111431/http://lucasfans.adventuregamer.com/features/interview_noahfalstein.html | url=http://lucasfans.adventuregamer.com/features/interview_noahfalstein.html | title=Interviews: Noah Falstein | author=Linkola, Joonas | date=2000 | work=[[Adventure Gamers|LucasFans]] | archive-date=March 9, 2001 | url-status=dead}}</ref>

''[[Compute!]]'' called ''PHM Pegasus'' "a worthy addition to even the casual game player's collection. It's a must if you are an action fanatic looking for a new challenge".<ref name="trunzo198709">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-09-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_088_1987_Sep#page/n61/mode/2up | title=PHM Pegasus | work=Compute! | date=September 1987 | access-date=10 November 2013 | author=Trunzo, James V. | pages=61}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' consulted with a hydrofoil expert to review ''PHM Pegasus'' in 1987. The magazine stated that the game understated damage to the player's ship from missiles, but that the hydrofoil's velocity was realistic; the game also accurately modeled the possibility of shooting down a missile with gunfire. It concluded that "the game has a certain sameness and/or lack of elan which differentiates the truly outstanding product from the merely good one".{{r|brooks198709}} 1992 and 1994 surveys in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game two and a half stars out of five.<ref name="brooks199206">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1992 | access-date=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
