''Crumble's Crisis'' is a flip-screen action-adventure game in which the player controlling Captain Crumble equipped with a jet backpack flies through maze-like levels, dodges hostile fauna and searches for escaped zoo creatures. There are 5 unique zones to search, each containing 6 hiding Fuzzies. The player has only one life and if they touch any wall or enemy, it will deplete the suit's energy, but it can be recovered by collecting energy packs. As in ''Space Lobsters'' - the action takes place in a shrunken window - about 1/2 of the game screen, while the rest of it is filled with decorations and cages showing the number of captured Fuzzies.

==Reception==

He also praised "a stunning comic title screen and accompanying music."<ref name="page6"/> Similarly, Niels Reynolds, who reviewed the game for ''[[Atari User]]'' magazine, rated it at 8 points overall, including a 9 out of 10 points for playability.<ref name="atariuser"/>
