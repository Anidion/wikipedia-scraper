'''''Slalom''''', originally released as '''''VS. Slalom''''', is a [[skiing]] [[sports video game]] developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Nintendo]] in 1986 for the [[Nintendo VS. System]] in [[Arcade game|arcades]]. It was then released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America in August 1987 and in Europe later that year. The player [[Racing game|races]] in a series of downhill [[slalom skiing]] runs while navigating past flags and obstacles before time expires. It was developed by [[Tim and Chris Stamper]] and its music was composed by [[David Wise (composer)|David Wise]].

''Slalom'' is the first NES game developed outside Japan and the Stamper brothers' first game released under the Rare brand. Reviews from the 1980s found ''Slalom'' unrealistic, but largely appreciated its graphics and animations, and the original arcade version received praise for its innovative [[ski]] controls. In contrast, ''[[AllGame]]''{{'}}s retrospective review called the game poorly made and rushed. ''Slalom'' was released in Rare's 2015 ''[[Rare Replay]]'' compilation for [[Xbox One]].

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Slalom (NES) screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The player heads downhill.]]
''Slalom'' is a [[single-player]] game in which players race downhill in a series of [[slalom skiing]] races. There are 24 downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains.<ref>{{cite book |title=Slalom ''back cover'' |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |year=1986}}</ref> Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on [[difficulty level|difficulty]]: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts.<ref name="Manual">{{Cite book|title=Slalom ''Instruction Booklet'' |editor=Rare |editor-link=Rare (company) |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |location=[[Redmond, WA]] |year=1986}}</ref>{{rp|4}} The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or else they will tumble and lose time.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|5}} With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles.<ref name="Gen 4"/> Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski on the wrong side of the flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|6}}

Also located on the runs are [[Mogul skiing|mogul]]s (bumps) that, when hit, causes the racer to go airborne and slow down slightly when landing.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|6}} While airborne, players can perform [[freestyle skiing|freestyle tricks]] and earn bonus points, but if the player botches the trick, the racer may tumble and fall, losing time. At the end of each run, final scores are calculated based on the amount of time remaining on the run and points scored from completing freestyle tricks.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|7}} If the player earns enough points, they may race the next level "solo" (without other skiers onscreen).<ref name="Gen 4"/> The points earned in qualifying runs convert to additional seconds on the solo run timer.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|7}} The [[high score]]s on each of the runs are saved in memory until the console is powered off.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|4}}

==Development==
''Slalom'' was developed by British video game company [[Rare (company)|Rare]] by [[Tim and Chris Stamper]].<ref name="Davison">{{cite magazine |last=Davison |first=John |title=25 Years of Rare |magazine=[[GamePro]] |date=June 2, 2010 |access-date=August 4, 2011 |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/215329/25-years-of-rare/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225180552/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/215329/25-years-of-rare/|archive-date=2010-12-25}}</ref> Rare had been looking to develop games for consoles in the wake of rampant computer game piracy in the United Kingdom. They chose the NES for its nascent popularity,<ref name="RG int"/> though the console had no Western developers, and asked Nintendo for a license. When Nintendo declined, they [[reverse engineered]] the console and made a [[demo (software)|demo]], ''Slalom'' to show the company. Nintendo was astonished at their effort, and made Rare its first Western developer, beginning a long and close collaboration between Rare and [[Nintendo of America]] founder and president [[Minoru Arakawa]].<ref name="Retro Glimpse"/>

''Slalom'' was originally released in 1986 in arcades as part of the [[Nintendo VS. System]] and is titled ''VS. Slalom''. This features an [[Video game arcade cabinet#Upright cabinets|upright cabinet]], a joystick, one jump button, monaural sound, and standard [[raster graphics]]. An optional controller upgrade features two physical ski poles and shortened skis that the player stands on to control the skier.<ref name=vs>{{cite web |title=''Killer List of Videogames: Vs.

The music is the first NES composing job by Rare's video game composer David Wise. In a December 2010 interview, Wise said that he found the NES sound board work challenging.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greening|first1=Chris|title=David Wise Interview: Revisiting Donkey Kong Country|date=December 15, 2010|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/davidwiseinterview/|publisher=Video Game Music Online|access-date=22 August 2015}}</ref> He had to first code the [[Hex code|HEX values]] for each [[musical note|note]] by hand before converting them into [[subroutine]]s with a computer.

Upon its original release in arcades, ''VS. Slalom'' was reviewed by Clare Edgeley in British magazine ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''. She praised the innovative ski controls, but said it lacked "staying power" and considered it an "above average" game without the ski controls.<ref name=":7">{{Cite magazine|last=Edgeley|first=Clare|title=Arcade Action|magazine=Computer and Video Games|issue=63 (January 1987)|date=16 December 1986|publisher=[[EMAP]]|location=United Kingdom|issn=0261-3697|pages=138–9|url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-063/page/n137/mode/2up}}</ref>

The NES version of ''Slalom'' received preview coverage in early 1987 in the first issue of ''[[Nintendo Fun Club News]]'' – the predecessor to the company's [[house organ|official monthly magazine]] ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' – citing the arcade conversion to the NES.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Sneak Peeks – ''Slalom'' | magazine=[[Nintendo Fun Club News]] | publisher=[[Nintendo]] | location=[[Redmond, WA]] | volume=1 | number=1 | date=Winter 1987 | page=3 | issn=1041-9551 | oclc=18893582 | url=https://archive.org/stream/Nintendo_Fun_Club_News_Issue_01_Winter_1987#page/n2/mode/1up}}</ref> It was featured in the following Summer 1987 issue with a brief overview and expert tips.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=''Slalom'': How fast can you shoosh? | magazine=Nintendo Fun Club News | publisher=Nintendo | location=Redmond, WA | volume=1 | number=2 | date=Summer 1987 | pages=2–3 | issn=1041-9551 | oclc=18893582 | url=https://archive.org/stream/Nintendo_Fun_Club_News_Issue_02_Summer_1987#page/n1/mode/2up}}</ref> French magazine [[Tilt (French magazine)|''Tilt'']] appreciated the game's graphics and sound, but thought its animation did not fare as well.<ref name=Tilt/> German magazine ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' highly commended ''Slalom''{{'}}s animations (particularly its use of scrolling and perspective) and said its sounds were mediocre. The magazine found the game fun, though unrealistic.<ref name=ASM>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/asm_magazine-1988-02/ASM_02_1988#page/n55/mode/1up/ |magazine=[[Aktueller Software Markt]] |language=de |issue=2 |pages=56 |date=February 1988 |issn=0933-1867 |title=Hals-und Beinbruch (Slalom)}}</ref> ''Power Play''<ref name="Power Play"/> and ''Gen4'' similarly praised the animations. Though ''Gen 4'' found the game unrealistic, they appreciated its depiction of speed and the gradual difficulty progression.<ref name="Gen 4"/> ''Power Play'' liked the level and obstacle graphics.<ref name="Power Play"/> ''Gen 4'' considered the graphics average for Nintendo, and disagreed internally as to whether the game was sufficiently fantastical.<ref name="Gen 4"/> ''Power Play'' thought the game needed more variety and quickly became monotonous.<ref name="Power Play"/>

''AllGame'' editor Brett Alan Weiss's retrospective review was critical as he called ''Slalom'' "a rush job" that did not capture the spirit of skiing. He said that the game was repetitive, too simple, and not fun for adults. Weiss described the graphics as blocky and insipid, the sound as repetitive and derivative. He said that even though it was an early release in the console's lifespan, ''Slalom'' was on par with the 1979 [[Intellivision]]'s capabilities. He recommended [[Konami|Konami's]] ''[[Antarctic Adventure]]'' for the [[ColecoVision]] instead.<ref name="Weiss"/> UK-based magazine ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' wrote that the game received little fanfare.<ref name="RG2006" /> The magazine's Stuart Hunt wrote in December 2010, on Rare's 25th anniversary, that the game was "fun but quite simplistic" in its lack of race variety. He said, though, that the game showcased how the company could maximize the system resources of the NES.<ref name="RG2010" /> ''Slalom'' was included in ''Rare Replay'', a compilation of 30 Rare games, released on the Xbox One on August 4, 2015.<ref name="Polygon: Replay"/>
