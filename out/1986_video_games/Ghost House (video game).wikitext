{{nihongo|'''''Ghost House'''''|ゴーストハウス|Gōsuto Hausu|lead=yes}} is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] developed and published by [[Sega]], released for the [[Master System]] in 1986.<ref name="ignhistory">{{cite web|author=Travis Fahs|url= http://retro.ign.com/articles/104/1040759p1.html|title=IGN Presents the History of Survival Horror|date= 30 October 2009|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2009-11-02}}</ref> ''Ghost House'' is loosely based on Sega's 1982 arcade video game, ''Monster Bash''. The game was originally released in the [[Sega Card]] format, then re-released on cartridge.

==Plot==
The player controls Mick, a young vampire hunter out to destroy five [[vampire]]s (or "Draculas" as the instruction book calls them) in each stage before proceeding to the next. In later levels Draculas may re-spawn. 

Everything is out to stop Mick from completing this task and making his way out of the [[mansion]]. The player has to punch or jump on enemies to defeat them. [[Arrow]]s fly from either direction after Mick passes a fireplace and will attempt to hit him, and he must either duck or jump on them for extra points and eventually gain invincibility as per the amount jumped on (25). Players can jump to touch [[light]]s to freeze everything on screen for a few seconds. Rather than punching, the player can collect a [[sword]] on any level by jumping on a candelabra as it flies past. Exploiting the game's backgrounds and tricks provide for a unique experience as well as facilitating the expulsions of all the Draculas. The sword is useful when the player fights a Dracula or needs to get rid of Fire Blowers and Mummies.

The player starts the game with three lives, and receives an additional life every 50,000 and 150,000 points. There is also an energy meter. The player loses energy after touching [[monster]]s, which leads to losing a life. The player can gain energy by collecting [[treasure]]s scattered throughout the mansion, and it is restored when a Dracula is killed.

==Release==
''Ghost House'' was released in Brazil as ''Chapolim X Dracula: Um Duelo Assustador'' (the subtitle translates as "A Spooky Duel") by [[Tectoy]]. Mick is replaced by ''[[El Chapulín Colorado]]'' (The Red Grasshopper).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
