'''''Alien Highway: Encounter 2''''' is an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] [[action game]] released by [[Vortex Software|Vortex]] in 1986 for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. It was programmed by [[Mark Haigh-Hutchinson]] and is the sequel to ''[[Highway Encounter]]''.

== Gameplay ==
Gameplay is similar to ''[[Highway Encounter]]'', with the player controlling a "Vorton" robot in its attempt to deliver a bomb to an alien base at the end of a highway. Various enemies and obstacles lie in its path.

A notable difference is that the player has a single Vorton with an energy meter, instead of five lives; accordingly, the bomb must be pushed by the player, whereas in the previous game it was pushed by the player's spare Vortons.

== Development ==
Mark Haigh-Hutchinson, the developer
<blockquote>"After ''Highway'' [[Costa Panayi|Costa [Panayi]]] wanted to come up with something completely different again. Since I was now working full-time for Vortex it was decided that I should write ''Alien Highway'' whilst Costa developed his new ideas. I had previously written ''[[Android One: The Reactor Run|Android One]]'' for the [[Amstrad CPC]] (in my spare time at University) and then converted ''Highway Encounter'' to the CPC in 8 weeks after graduation. ''Alien Highway'' attempted to retain the essence of the original game yet expand the gameplay and introduce a random element into the game. It was also considerably faster than the original."<ref>Mark Haigh-Hutchinson, "The History of Vortex Software", March 1995</ref></blockquote>
