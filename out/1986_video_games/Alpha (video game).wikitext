''Alpha'' uses a [[text parser]] to interpret the player's instructions and displays the results on screen.

==Gameplay==
The storyline of ''Alpha'' progresses as the player inputs short commands carried out by the game's heroine.<ref name=eggs/> Similarly to another interactive fiction game by Square, ''[[The Death Trap]]'', but contrary to most games in the genre, the situations confronted by the main character are presented in still pictures. The text is displayed within a white-bordered blue background, also present in message windows of the early ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' installments. Hidden characters appear in the background of most scenes, and such as a ninja appearing outside a car window.<ref name=denpa/>

==Story==
''Alpha'' is set in the future after the Earth's natural resources have been completely drained. Humanity is forced to embark on a centuries-long trip to the titular planet on the space ship ''Daedalus''.<ref name="amuse">{{cite web |url=http://www.amusement-center.com/project/egg/cgi/ecatalog-detail.cgi?product_id=1136 |title=ALPHA /EGG |language=Japanese |publisher=Project EGG |date=2013-12-24 |accessdate=2016-02-01}}</ref> Because technology for suspended animation does not exist, only the distant descendants of the original passengers and crew are alive by the time the game takes place. The main character, Chris, begins the game with [[amnesia]] and a terrorist attack quickly draws her into a revolution which aims to overthrow the dictatorial ''Daedalus'' computer system.<ref name="amuse"/> As Chris interacts with the revolutionary group, she uncovers the true nature of Alpha, the ''Daedalus'', and herself.<ref name="JP">{{cite book | author = 山下章 | author-link = 山下章 | title = チャレンジ!!パソコン AVG & RPG II | year = 1987 | publisher = 電波新聞社 | edition = 1987年10月20日の改装小型版(オリジナルは1987年1月) | language=Japanese | pages = 73–82}}</ref><!--more plot details from an unreliable source: http://retrogaming.blog128.fc2.com/blog-entry-35.html-->

==Reception==
''Alpha'' was unique in that it was an [[eroge]], or erotic, title from game developer Square.<ref name=erotica>{{cite web|url= https://www.pcgamer.com/game-preservation-society-japanese-pc-games-square-enix-game-arts/|accessdate=May 31, 2020|date=October 29, 2019|publisher=PC Gamer|title=The race to save Japan's incredible '80s PC gaming history before it's gone|author=Fenlon, Wes}}</ref>
The game is noted its difficulty, in that there are points where if the player loses an important item, they may not be able to retrieve it again, and if players make a mistake at crucial scenes, there is no opportunity to do it over.<ref name=denpa/> The game does not end if these things happen, but players can progress no further in the game either.<ref name=denpa/> In 2014, the game was released on a retro gaming distribution service called "Project Egg".<ref name=eggs>{{cite web|url= https://www.4gamer.net/games/008/G000896/20140527013/|title= レトロゲーム配信サービス『プロジェクトEGG』にて 2014年5月27日に『ALPHA（PC-9801版）』をリリース|publisher=4Gamer|accessdate=June 2, 2020|date=May 27, 2014}}</ref>
