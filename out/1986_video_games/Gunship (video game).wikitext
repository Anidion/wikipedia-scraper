'''''Gunship''''' is a [[Combat flight simulation game|combat flight simulation video game]] developed and published by [[MicroProse]] in 1986. In the game, controlling a simulated [[AH-64 Apache]] helicopter, players navigate through missions to attack  enemy targets and protect friendly forces. Commercially and critically successful, ''Gunship'' was followed by ''[[Gunship 2000]]'' and ''[[Gunship!]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Gunshipscreenshot.png|thumb|left|Preparing to take off.]]

The game features missions in five regions, including the U.S. (training), [[Southeast Asia]] ([[1st Air Cavalry Division]]), [[Central America]] ([[82nd Airborne Division]]), [[Middle East]] ([[101st Airborne Division]]) and [[Western Europe]] ([[U.S. 3rd Armored Division|3rd Armored Division]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/gunship|title=Gunship|publisher=Mobygames|date=1986|accessdate=11 June 2014}}</ref> After selection of region, style, and enemies, the pilot is assigned a primary mission and a secondary mission. These could include such objectives as "Destroy enemy headquarters" or "Support friendly troops" (i.e. destroy targets near friendly forces). The latter would be an easier mission, because the battle would be fought closer to friendly lines.

The pilot then arms the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|Apache helicopter gunship]], usually selecting [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] air-to-ground missiles (guided missiles that destroy "hard" targets such as bunkers and tanks), [[Fin-Folding Aerial Rocket|FFAR]]s (Folding Fin Aerial Rockets; unguided rockets that destroy "soft" targets such as infantry and installations), and HEDP (High-Explosive, Dual-Purpose) rounds for the 30&nbsp;mm cannon (an all-purpose weapon with a maximum range of 1.5&nbsp;km); in Central America, the Middle East, and Western Europe, [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]s would also be standard equipment, usually as a backup air-to-air weapon in case of cannon failure.

Patient players might move in short jumps, crouching behind hills to block the enemy's line of sight and suddenly popping up to attack. More aggressive players generally fly fast and erratically to evade enemy fire, flying in low to deliver devastating cannon attacks at close range. Since flight time is a component of the mission evaluation, either method has its advantages. The latter, however, can be rather dangerous against 1st Line enemies whose fast reaction times can cause the chopper to be pummelled with relentless fire.

Most enemy fire, especially small caliber, is deflected by armor, but some will cause systems damage. After enough damaging hits, the structural integrity will fail, causing a general power failure that requires the pilot to use [[autorotation]] to land safely. An emergency landing by a seriously injured pilot in enemy territory causes him to become [[Missing in Action]]. If the pilot lands without serious injury, he can escape back to base and live to fight another day.

There is no defined time limit in the game. A player can return to any number of Forward Area Resupply Points to be rearmed, refueled and damage repaired. Returning to the Home Base will end the mission. Ideally, the pilot completes both missions, knocks out other targets, and makes it back to base within 20 minutes.

There is no ending to ''Gunship''. Promotions stop once a pilot makes [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]], although he can continue amassing medals, such as the [[Purple Heart]], [[Air Medal]], [[Bronze Star]], [[Silver Star]], [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], and the [[Medal of Honor]] and retire with a final promotion to Brig. General. No medals in this game are prerequisites for earning others (the requirement of shooting down two Hinds in one mission for the Medal of Honor led some to believe that it was not possible to earn it before earning lower medals). Repeated medals are harder to earn than the first one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightsimbooks.com/gunship/10_4_Winning_Medals.php |title=Winning Medals |publisher=Flightsimbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> The criteria for winning medals is based on types of targets destroyed, number of targets destroyed, objectives met, time elapsed, and sometimes whether or not the pilot is wounded. As in real life, medals in this game can be awarded posthumously.

==Development and release==
MicroProse intended ''Gunship'' to simulate an urban helicopter akin to ''[[Blue Thunder]]'', but found that city graphics were too difficult. It instead used tools developed for ''[[F-15 Strike Eagle (computer game)|F-15 Strike Eagle]]'' to create another military simulation.<ref name="brooks198711">{{cite magazine | title=Titans of the Computer Gaming World / MicroProse | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=41 | date=November 1987 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1987&pub=2&id=41 | accessdate=23 April 2016 | last=Brooks | first=M. Evan | pages=16}}</ref> The game was released in 1986 for the PC [[DOS]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]], [[FM Towns]], [[MSX]], [[PC-98]], [[Sharp X68000]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

''Gunship'' was also ported to the [[Sega Genesis]] by [[U.S. Gold]] only in Europe in 1993. However, this version of the game differed from the others by featuring more arcade-style gameplay and horizontal [[shoot 'em up]] stages.
