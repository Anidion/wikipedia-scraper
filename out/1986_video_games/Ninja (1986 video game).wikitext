'''''Ninja''''' is a [[beat 'em up]] game developed by [[Sculptured Software]] and released by [[Mastertronic]] in 1986 for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]], then in 1987 for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[MS-DOS]].<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/ninja_ ''Ninja''] at mobygames.com</ref> An [[Arcade video game|arcade]] version of the game was released in 1987 for Mastertronic's Arcadia Systems which is based on Amiga hardware.<ref>[http://gamesdbase.com/game/arcade/ninja-mission.aspx ''Ninja Mission'' (Arcade)] at gamesdbase.com</ref> The Amiga, Atari ST, and Arcade versions were released as '''''Ninja Mission'''''. As a Ninja, the player attacks a fortress made of individual fixed screens which can be explored non-linearly.

''Ninja'' was written by Steve Coleman, who previously created the Atari 8-bit games ''[[Rainbow Walker]]'' and ''[[The Pharaoh's Curse (video game)|The Pharaoh's Curse]]''.<ref name=giantlist/>

The player controls a [[ninja]] who has to penetrate a Japanese fortress by fighting enemy ninjas with [[karate]] moves and by throwing [[shuriken]]s and [[dagger]]s. On his way, he has to collect all of the idols. The fortress is a series of horizontal, flip-screen segments that are stacked vertically. The player is not forced along a specific route, but can explore both sides of a branching path and also backtrack to earlier  screens.
