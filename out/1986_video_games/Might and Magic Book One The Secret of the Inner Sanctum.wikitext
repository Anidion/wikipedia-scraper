'''''Might and Magic Book One: Secret of the Inner Sanctum''''' (also known as simply ''Might and Magic'') is an early [[role-playing video game]], first in the popular and influential ''[[Might and Magic]]'' franchise. It was released in 1986 as [[New World Computing]]'s debut, ported to numerous platforms and re-released continuously through the early 1990s.

==Plot and setting==

The game is set on the world of VARN which features expansive outdoor terrain, castles, caves, underground cities and an Astral Plane.

The game centers on six adventurers who are trying to discover the secret of the Inner Sanctum: a kind of "holy grail" quest. While trying to discover the Inner Sanctum, the heroes discover information about a mysterious character named Corak and his hunt for the missing villain Sheltem. They end up unmasking Sheltem, who had been masquerading as the King, and defeating his evil machinations.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kaplon | first=Jay | url=http://www.celestialheavens.com/viewpage.php?id=373 | title=Might and Magic History | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210127230725/https://www.celestialheavens.com/viewpage.php?id=373 | archive-date=2021-01-27 | website=Celestial Heavens – All Things Might and Magic | url-status=dead}}</ref> At the end of the game they go through the "Gates to Another World" and travel to CRON, not knowing that Sheltem has also escaped to that world.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mightandmagicgrove.com/mm1/quests.htm | title=Fander Treespook's Might and Magic Grove – MM1 Quests | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907233040/http://mightandmagicgrove.com/mm1/quests.htm | archive-date=2007-09-07 | url-status=dead}}</ref>

Although it appears to take place in a straightforward [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[fantasy]] setting of [[knight]]s in armor, mythical [[monster]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]]s, a number of [[science fiction]] elements are revealed later in the game, down to the actual meaning of VARN (Vehicular Astropod Research Nacelle). This was a relatively common trait of early CRPGs, as also seen in the oldest ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' and ''[[Wizardry]]'' titles. For example, the Sheltem plot is first introduced when the adventurers visit the site of a crashed [[Spacecraft|space ship]] and are told by [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]] that their prisoner is at large in the world.<ref>{{cite web |archive-date=2007-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102944/http://mightandmagicgrove.com/mm1/e2.htm |title=Fander Treespook's Might and Magic Grove – MM1 Overland Map Area E2 |url=http://mightandmagicgrove.com/mm1/e2.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Game mechanics==

===Characters===
The characters in ''Might and Magic'' and its successors are defined by a number of rules, conforming loosely to the fantasy role-playing archetypes.

Characters have "statistics" (analogous to ''Dungeons and Dragons'' [[Dungeons & Dragons gameplay#Ability scores|Ability score]]s) of Might, Endurance, Speed, Accuracy, Personality, Intelligence and Luck.<ref>Butler-Knight, Marie and Van Canegham, Jon, 1997. ''Might and Magic Book One Secret of the Inner Sanctum'' Second Edition game documentation page 23, New World Computing</ref>

There are six [[character class]]es:
* '''Knight''' characters are based on the ''Dungeons and Dragons'' [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighter]] class.
* '''Cleric''' characters are like ''D&D'' [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Clerics]].
* '''Robbers''' are like the old ''D&D'' [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Thief]] class.
* '''Sorcerers''' (called '''Wizards''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version) are like the old [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Magic-User]]s.
* '''Paladins''' are fighter type characters who gain access to Clerical magic at higher [[experience level]]s. Unlike their ''D&D'' [[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|equivalent]], there is no restriction on their alignment.
* '''Archers''' are more limited fighter characters, who can use ranged weapons even when on the front line of combat, and gain access to Sorcerer [[Incantation|spells]] at higher levels.<ref name="Butler-Knight, page 24">Butler-Knight, page 24</ref>

The player assigns each character a race at creation time: [[Human]], [[Elf]], [[Orc|Half-orc]], [[Gnome]] or [[Dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]]. This affects the character's starting statistics, and their resistance to various forms of attack.<ref name="Butler-Knight, page 25">Butler-Knight, page 25</ref>

[[Alignment (role-playing games)|Alignment]] is also chosen for all characters, but because the [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] acts collectively all of the time, the implications of this are minimal. Alignment plays some part in the game, in particular to determine the reward for one of the game's [[Quest (video games)|quests]].<ref>[http://www.thecomputershow.com/computershow/walkthroughs/mightandmagic1walk.htm Might and Magic (1) Walkthrough]</ref>

Characters can also be male or female.<ref>Butler-Knight, page 4</ref> Like alignment, gender serves minimal purpose in the game, save for a few situations (notably, the city of Portsmith, in which all males, and only males, are injured when stepping through certain areas of the city). A character's gender can be changed back and forth via certain actions within the game world.<ref>[http://home.student.uva.nl/michael.saltzherr/m/migtmag1.htm Might and Magic I FAQ/Walkthrough] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321203741/http://home.student.uva.nl/michael.saltzherr/m/migtmag1.htm |date=2008-03-21 }}</ref>

===Magic===
There are two types of magic spells in ''Might and Magic'': Sorcerer spells and Clerical spells. Sorcerer spells are available to Sorcerer and Archer characters; Clerical spells are available to Cleric and Paladin characters.<ref name="Butler-Knight, page 24"/> Daily spellcasting ability is limited by a character's ''spell points''.<ref name="Butler-Knight, page 25"/> For users of Sorcerer spells, the number of spell points available depends on that character's Intelligence statistic. For Clerical spellcasters, the number of spell points depends on the character's Personality statistic.<ref>Butler-Knight, page 23</ref>

Sorcerer spells tend to be of an offensive nature, inflicting damage on enemy creatures.

Clerical spells are usually more defensive, focusing on healing, defense and removal of poison and other undesirable effects.<ref name="Butler-Knight, page 24"/>

===Exploration===
[[File:Might magic1.png|thumb|right|300px|A typical screenshot of the IBM-PC port of the game in exploration mode]]
The world is presented as a labyrinth, utilizing a [[First person (video games)|first person perspective]] interface similar to that employed by ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]'', where the gaming world is divided into a maze-like grid and the player's movement options are to move forward or backward, or turn ninety degrees left or right. The walls represent mountain ridges, cave stone, rows of trees or whatever obstruction might be expected in the terrain being explored.

Exploration, like combat, is [[Time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] in ''Might and Magic''; hence in-game time does not pass while the player delays.<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/might-and-magic-book-i Might and Magic: Secret of the Inner Sanctum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903210815/http://www.mobygames.com/game/might-and-magic-book-i/ |date=2007-09-03 }} at [[MobyGames]]</ref>

If the party moves to a place where there are hostile creatures, or if a [[random encounter]] occurs, the game switches to a combat phase.<ref>Butler-Knight, pages 7–12</ref>

===Combat===
When hostile creatures are encountered, the player is usually given the option to run away, attempt to surrender to the creatures, try to bribe them, or to attack. If the player elects to attack, or if their combat evasion attempt fails, the game enters combat mode.<ref>Butler-Knight, page 13</ref>

On most platforms, the combat interface is presented in a text-only format.<ref>Butler-Knight, page 15</ref> [[Time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|Turn-based]] combat is conducted, with each combatant acting in order of their speed statistic. Each round a random speed bonus is applied to either the player's party or the enemy creatures.<ref>Butler-Knight, page 16</ref> On each player-character's turn, the player selects an action from a list of options, including attacking a creature, casting a spell or attempting to run away.<ref>Butler-Knight, pages 17–18</ref>

Combat ends when all combatants from one side or the other have either been rendered unconscious or dead (usually by having their [[Health (gaming)|hit point]]s reduced to zero), or fled from combat. The player can also lose at combat by allowing all members of the party to succumb to sleep or paralysis effects.

==Development==
The original Apple II version of the game was written almost single-handedly by [[Jon Van Caneghem]] over three years.<ref>Green, Jeff, 2004. ''[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdcgw/is_200404/ai_n9515262/ Jon Van Caneghem Speaks]'', Computer Gaming World, April 2004</ref> Van Caneghem had difficulty finding a publisher to distribute ''Might and Magic'', so he self-published as New World Computing, handling the distribution himself from his own apartment until he was able to broker a distribution deal with [[Activision]].

Due to its popularity the game was [[porting|ported]] to a number of other platforms that were popular at the time, and nine sequels were released over the next fifteen years.<ref>Jahn, Oliver et al. ''[http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/might-and-magic-series/ Might and Magic Series]'', [[MobyGames]]</ref>

A port of ''Might and Magic'' was released for [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/nes/rpg/mightandmagic/index.html |title=Gamespot: Might and Magic for NES |access-date=2007-06-15 |archive-date=2007-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315205556/http://www.gamespot.com/nes/rpg/mightandmagic/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> While the basic gameplay was similar to ports released on earlier platforms, the graphics and general polish on the game reflected the later release date and greater capability of the Nintendo platform.<ref>See screenshots at [https://archive.today/20061027225021/http://www.consoleclassix.com/gameinfo_mightandmagic_nes.html ConsoleClassix.com]</ref> The music for this version was composed by [[Masaharu Iwata]].

The game was remade again for release in Japan on the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] platform. This version of the game was released on [[CD-ROM²]] rather than cartridge and was able to feature digitized voices for dialogue as a result of the increased storage capacity offered by the CD medium.

The game was later included in ''[[Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven]]''  Limited Edition and Special Edition.

==Reception==
''Might and Magic'' sold over 100,000 copies by 1989.<ref name=sales>{{cite journal| author=McLean, Mickey |title=Commodore Clips; ...And So Does New World|date=September 1989 |issue=75| journal=[[Compute!'s Gazette]] | page=8 }}</ref>

In 1987, ''[[Compute!]]'' magazine praised ''Might and Magic'' for its wealth of content, non-linear play and aspects of its graphics, though it notes that the game graphics lack animation, and that there is limited graphical representation of enemy combatants.<ref>[http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue87/Might_and_Magic.php Might And Magic], review by James V.

The Apple II version of the game was reviewed in 1987 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #122 by Patricia Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column.  Lesser stated that "This adventure is awesome in its scope, completely fascinating, graphically pleasing, and one of the top five games ever produced for a computer."<ref name="Dragon122">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|last=Lesser|first=Patricia|journal=Dragon|issue=122|date=June 1987

Modern commentators acknowledge ''MM1'' for the immense scope of its world, for its freedom of exploration and for pioneering aspects such as incorporating player characters' race, gender and alignment into the gameplay.<ref>[http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070223b/barton_08.shtml The History of Computer Role-Playing Games Part 2: The Golden Age (1985–1993)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111001815/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070223b/barton_08.shtml |date=2010-11-11 }} by Matt Barton, [[Gamasutra]]</ref>
