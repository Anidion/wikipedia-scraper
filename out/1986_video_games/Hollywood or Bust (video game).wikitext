'''Hollywood or Bust''' is an [[action game]] published by [[Mastertronic]] in 1986 for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]].

==Gameplay==
The character is a wannabe [[film]] star named Busterâ€”possibly after [[Buster Keaton]] to who he bears a resemblance.  The character wanders around a 1920s film set, searching for five [[Academy Awards|Oscar Statues]] while being chased by a series of [[Police Officer|Policemen]].  The studios are also haunted by a number of [[ghost]]s who attack Buster at random.  If Buster comes into contact with either one, the game ends.

During his search, Buster can occasionally find himself in the middle of a street scene where he has to survive wave after wave of policemen.  Fortunately he can defend himself with a number of [[Custard Pie]]s which can be replenished by turning a tap at the top right of the screen.  Once the timer runs to zero, Buster finds himself back in the studio where he resumed the hunt for the Oscars which have to be collected in numerical order.

If Buster is successful in collecting all five Oscars, the game ends as Buster is awarded a lifetime contract with the studio.  Failure results in the [[Film director|director]] yelling "Cut" and the game beginning again.
