{{nihongo|'''''Quartet'''''|カルテット}} is a [[run and gun video game]] released by [[Sega]] for [[Arcade video game|arcades]] in 1986. ''Quartet'' allows one to four players to guide a set of characters through a base taken over by an army of [[robots]]. Players control either Joe (yellow), Mary (red), Lee (blue), or Edgar (green) across 32 [[side-scrolling]] levels.  The object of the game is to advance through the level, fighting opponents that come out of portals in the walls, and eventually defeat a boss that carries the door key used to open the "exit door" for the level.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The game was released as a dedicated four-player cabinet similar to [[Atari Games]]' ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]''.<ref name=cashbox19870117>{{cite journal|title=Coin-Op '86: Putting into perspective the year in review|journal=Cash Box|date=January 17, 1987|url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox50unse_23/page/n51/mode/2up?q=Quartet+Sega}}</ref> A 2-players version, titled '''''Quartet 2''''', was released by [[Sunsoft|Sun Electronics]], as a conversion kit.<ref name=cashbox19861129>{{cite journal|title=Cash Box Tours The AMOA Expo '86 Exhibits|journal=Cash Box|date= November 29, 1986|url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox50unse_18/page/28/mode/2up?q=%22Quartet+2%22}}</ref> The game was ported to the [[Master System]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].
