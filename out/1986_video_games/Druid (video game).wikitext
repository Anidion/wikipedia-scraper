'''''Druid''''' is a [[hack and slash]] [[dungeon crawl]] developed by [[Electralyte Software]] and published by [[Firebird Software|Firebird]] in 1986 for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], and [[Commodore 64]]. It was also ported to [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and by Nippon Dexter in 1988 for the [[MSX]], although the MSX port was released in Japan only. Another Japanese port of ''Druid'' entitled {{nihongo|''Druid: Kyōfu no Tobira''|ドルイド　恐怖の扉}} was made for the [[Famicom Disk System]] by [[Jaleco]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.jp/f_tamakoku/famicon/database/1988/1988_03.htm |title=データベース1988-3 |publisher=Geocities.jp |accessdate=2014-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114043613/http://www.geocities.jp/f_tamakoku/famicon/database/1988/1988_03.htm |archive-date=2012-01-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The game was followed by ''[[Druid II: Enlightenment]]'' and ''[[Warlock: The Avenger]]''.

Inspired by the arcade game ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'',<ref name=rom>{{cite web|author=Review-O-Matic |url=http://www.review-o-matic.com/?p=69 |title=Blog Archive » Druid (C64) |publisher=Review-O-Matic |date=2009-03-27 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}</ref> ''Druid'' is a fantasy-themed dungeon crawl where the player plays the part of Hasrinaxx, a druid who is trying to rid the world of the dark mage Acamantor and his army of demons. To do this, Hasrinaxx must travel through several levels.

The first level is a normal landscape, and the ones after that are underground, each one deeper than the previous. Each level is infested with various enemies such as ghosts, giant insects, witches, and the four demon princes. Hasrinaxx can shoot these enemies with three different weapons: water, fire, and electricity, but they all come in a finite supply and are not equally effective on all enemies. Using a Chaos spell will destroy all enemies in the player's vicinity as well as replenish energy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-018/ZZap_64_Issue_018_1986_Oct#page/n17/mode/1up|title = ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 018|date = October 1986}}</ref> The four demon princes can only be defeated with a Chaos spell; common weapons are ineffective against them.

Hasrinaxx can also summon a [[golem]] to help him or turn invisible for a brief period. In both Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64 versions, a second player can take control of the golem using joystick port 2.<ref name=rom/> {{clear left}}
