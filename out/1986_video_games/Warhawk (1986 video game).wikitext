==Reception==
''Computer and Video Games'' reviewed the Atari version which they compared to ''[[Uridium]]''. They admired the asteroid graphics but thought those of the aliens were a little weak though "they swoop around fast enough to keep you on your toes". The game was awarded a 7/10 score.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-072/CVG_072_Oct_1987#page/n33/mode/1up|title=CVG Magazine Issue 072|date=October 1987}}</ref>

''Commodore User'' praised the game's presentation, graphics and enemy AI which was considered to be superior to ''Uridium''{{'}}s. It was given an 8/10 overall score.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_2365_reviews|title=Commodore User (November 1986) Reviews - Amiga Magazine Rack}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The following year, Proteus Developments developed ''Tanium'', published by [[Players Software]] in 1988.

This project also involved Michael Ware from the development team of the 1986 release. ''Warhawk'' was remade for the ZX Spectrum Next with a version coded by Michael Ware and Jim Bagley.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Warhawk ZX Spectrum Next|url=https://www.spectrumnextgames.uk/warhawk|access-date=2020-07-27|website=www.spectrumnextgames.uk|language=en}}</ref> It received a physical release in spring 2020.
