Baseball''''' in North America, is a 1986 [[List of baseball video games|baseball video game]] developed and published by [[Namco]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].

==Development==
''Pro Baseball: Family Stadium'' was created by [[Namco]] programmer Yoshihiro Kishimoto, who had previously worked on games such as ''[[Baraduke]]'' (1985).<ref name="Untold History">{{cite book |last1=Szczepaniak |first1=John |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |date=11 August 2014 |isbn=978-0992926007 |pages=363}}</ref> The planner for ''[[Toy Pop]]'', Takefumi Hyodoh, had transferred from a different section of the company — as his first time being a planner, Hyodoh was rather slow, which left Kishimoto with plenty of free time.<ref name="Untold History"/> For a short while he spent most of his time playing Nintendo's ''[[Baseball (1983 video game)|Baseball]]'' for the Famicom with some of his colleagues, where during play they would bring up how certain parts of the game could be fixed or improved, notably the lack of names or abilities for the in-game players.<ref name="Untold History"/> Kishimoto also expressed disappointment towards the game's lack of playable defense.<ref name="Untold History"/> Once development of ''Toy Pop'' was completed, Kishimoto decided to try making a baseball game of his own.<ref name="Untold History"/>

The project was made for the [[Family Computer]] due to the system's massive success in Japan and for Namco's console and arcade operations being part of the same division, allowing Kishimoto to easily begin development of the game in his section of the company.<ref name="Untold History"/> After asking his supervisor about what work he was assigned to next, he was instead told he could make whatever type of game he wanted, due to a lack of work needed by him for the time being.<ref name="Untold History"/> ''Family Stadium'' was Kishomoto's first experience with developing a game for the Famicom and with [[assembly code]].<ref name="Untold History"/> It was also Namco's first baseball video game, as prior to the game's release they had released several baseball-themed mechanical arcade games, such as ''Pitch In'' (1979) and ''Batting Chance'' (1981).

''Pro Baseball: Family Stadium'' was released in Japan on December 10, 1986.<ref name="Untold History"/> [[Atari Games]] released the game for arcades in North America in September 1987, renamed ''VS.

Baseball'', being one of the company's only three officially licensed games released for the console. Atari programmer Peter Lipson was responsible for the localization of the game.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hickey |first1=Patrick |title=The Minds Behind Sports Games: Interviews with Cult and Classic Video Game Developers |date=24 August 2020 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-4010-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-n5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA194 |pages=194–201}}</ref>

''R.B.I Baseball'' became the first console game of its kind to be licensed by the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (MLBPA) and used actual MLB player names, unlike other baseball video games of the late 1980s. As it was not licensed by [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) itself, it did not use team nicknames or logos. Instead, the game contained 8 teams listed by only their location: [[Boston Red Sox|Boston]], [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California]], [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]], [[Houston Astros|Houston]], [[Minnesota Twins|Minnesota]], [[New York Mets|New York]], [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis]], and [[San Francisco Giants|San Francisco]]; their real-life, MLB counterparts were the first place teams in each division in {{mlby|1986}} (Boston, California, Houston, New York) and {{mlby|1987}} (Detroit, Minnesota, St. Louis, San Francisco) MLB seasons. The game also boasted two All-Star teams, [[American League]] and [[National League (baseball)|National League]]; the two featured established veterans such as [[George Brett]], [[Mike Schmidt]], [[Dale Murphy]] and [[Andre Dawson]]—none of whom appeared on the other eight teams—and up-and-coming players like [[Mark McGwire]], [[Andrés Galarraga]], [[Kevin Seitzer]] and [[José Canseco]].
