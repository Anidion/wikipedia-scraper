'''''World Tour Golf''''' is a 1986 [[video game]] by Evan and [[Nicky Robinson (game programmer)|Nicky Robinson]], [[Paul Reiche III]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Electronic Arts]] for [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[Apple IIGS]], and [[DOS]].

==Development==
{{Original research|section|date=February 2019}}

After completing ''[[Mail Order Monsters]]'' in 1985, developers and producers at EA were playing ''[[Golf (1984 video game)|Nintendo Golf]]'', and the Robinsons decided to create a golf game for [[DOS]] including a [[golf course]] editor.

Evan Robinson worked on the game and graphics code (which was adapted from code written by Dan Silva for an internal EA editor named Prism, which eventually became [[Deluxe Paint]]) for ''World Tour Golf'', while Nicky Robinson created the editor and Paul Reiche acted as [[game designer]] and artist.  In 1986 it was unusual for a game to have more than one programmer, and this gave them an easy way to neatly subdivide the work.  It also allowed ''World Tour Golf'' to be a significantly larger game in scope than many contemporary titles.  The editor supported the accurate (for its day) re-creation of real golf courses, as well as comical courses that were made up of a series of islands, 270-degree doglegs, etc.  This followed in the spirit of ''[[Racing Destruction Set]]'', which had been developed at EA the year before.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

David M. Wilson and Johnny L. Wilson reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "IBM owners with CGA used to have to play with magenta trees and blue fairways, but a revision has corrected that aesthetic problem and supports EGA, as well. The EGA version still offers only the four best colors, however."<ref name="CGW46">{{cite magazine |last1=Wilson |first1=David M. |last2=Wilson |first2=Johnny L. |title=The Boys of Spring: A Computer Sports Survey |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1988 |volume=1 |issue=46 |pages=12–13}}</ref>
