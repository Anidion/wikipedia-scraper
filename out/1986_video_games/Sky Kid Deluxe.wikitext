{{nihongo|'''''Sky Kid Deluxe'''''|スカイキッドデラックス|Sukai Kiddo Derakkusu}} is a [[scrolling shooter|horizontally scrolling shooter]] released in arcades by [[Namco]] in 1986. It is the sequel to ''[[Sky Kid]]'', which was released in the previous year. It was the first game to run on the company's [[Namco System 86|System 86]] hardware. It was also the first game from the company to use a [[Yamaha YM2151]] [[frequency modulation|FM]] [[sound chip]] for its music. The gameplay is more difficult than the original, and also introduces several new enemies and missions.

The game was re-released in the Japan-only ''[[Namco Collection]]'' for [[Microsoft Windows]] and received its first ever worldwide port to a console as part of ''[[Namco Museum Virtual Arcade]]'' for the [[Xbox 360]], but did not include the second player's character Blue Max. The game was released on March 2, 2023 under the name ''Sky Kid DX'', for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]], as part of the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' series by [[Hamster Corporation]].

==Differences from the original==
* As mentioned above, ''Sky Kid Deluxe'' used the enhanced System 86 hardware (the original ran on the older [[Namco Pac-Land]] hardware) which allowed for greater variety in simultaneous colors (its palette is twice the size as that of the original; 512 as opposed to 256).
* The color of the sky is no longer only light blue for the whole game, but a range of different colors, including blues, grays and reds.
* Four new missions (numbered X1 to X4) have been inserted between the twenty-one original missions, for a total of twenty-five missions.
* Snow falls from the top of the screen (only in missions X1 and X3), which scrolls with the two Sky Kids as they are flying to the left.
* Several new enemies and mission targets have been introduced (one of whom, known as the "Kaminari Kid", cannot be killed by any means).
* Instead of only one background song produced by a Namco CUS30, ''Deluxe'' has two songs (produced by the aforementioned Yamaha YM2151).

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Sky Kid Deluxe'' on their May 1, 1986 issue as being the twenty-third most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=283|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 May 1986|page=19|lang=ja}}</ref>
