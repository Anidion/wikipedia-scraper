{{nihongo|'''''Romancia'''''|ロマンシア}}, also known as '''''Dragon Slayer Jr.''''', is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Nihon Falcom]]. It is the third installment in the ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' series, preceded by ''[[Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu|Xanadu]]'' and followed by ''[[Legacy of the Wizard|Dragon Slayer IV]]''.

''Romancia'' is a simpler and brightly colored game in comparison to the other ''Dragon Slayer'' titles, hence the name "Dragon Slayer Jr."

==Story==
The game begins with Prince {{nihongo|Fan Freddy|ファン・フレディ}} outside the castle. As in ''Xanadu'', Fan can speak with the king for some free equipment. The goal is to rescue Princess {{nihongo|Selina|セリナ}} within 30 minutes.

Princess Selina is the princess of the Kingdom of Romancia. She becomes a prisoner in the Kingdom of Azorba.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Yamashita|first=Akira|url=|title=CHALLENGE!!

==Gameplay==
''Romancia'' is an [[action role-playing game]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=October 12, 2014|title=『ソーサリアン ユーティリティーDISK』、『ロマンシア』がレトロゲーム配信サービス"プロジェクトEGG"にて配信スタート！|magazine=[[Famitsu]]|url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201410/21063974.html|url-status=live|access-date=|archive-date=January 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116014327/https://www.famitsu.com/news/201410/21063974.html}}</ref>

Movement is controlled with the arrow keys, and attacking is done with the action key. Unlike ''Xanadu'', there are almost no statistics, and zero customization. The game consists largely of two screens with a few small sub-areas. The player has only thirty minutes to complete the game, further illustrating the light and accessible nature of the title versus the oppressive underground complexes of ''Xanadu''.

If the player can't make progress in time they will have to start all over again.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=|title=『死ぬ前にクリアしたい200の無理ゲー ファミコン&スーファミ』|date=October 10, 2018|publisher=My Way Publishing|isbn=978-4-86511-985-5|location=Tokyo|pages=38|trans-title=200 Unreasonable Famicom & Super Famicom Games that I want to clear before I die|oclc=1051229562}}</ref>

In the MSX / MSX2 version, there is a mode in which the players can play Princess Serina as the main character with a hidden command.<ref name=":0" />

There is a weapon called the ''Dragon Slayer'' sword which can be found in the game.<ref name=":0" />

== Development ==
The game is part of the ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' series, that also includes ''[[Legacy of the Wizard]]'', ''[[Xanadu (video game)|Xanadu]]'', and ''[[Sorcerian]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Massey|first=Tom|date=2016-02-14|title=Falcom vs the fans|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-02-14-falcom-vs-the-fans|access-date=2021-01-15|website=Eurogamer|language=en|archive-date=2021-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116014327/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-02-14-falcom-vs-the-fans|url-status=live}}</ref> Yuzo Koshiro contributed tracks to the game.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=2017|title=Entrevistamos a Yuzo Koshiro|url=|magazine=Retro Gamer|language=ES|location=Spain|publisher=Future Publishing|issue=23|page=|pages=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>

== Release ==
The first release was in 1986 for the [[NEC PC-8801|PC-8801]], [[NEC PC-9801|PC-9801]], [[MSX]], and [[Sharp X1]] computers. A later [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] version was published by [[Tokyo Shoseki]] and developed by [[Compile (company)|Compile]].<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Compile Game History -その他-|trans-title=COMPILE GAME HISTORY -Other-|url=http://www.compile.co.jp/game/history/other/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980117062740/http://www.compile.co.jp/game/history/other/index.html|archive-date=1998-01-17|access-date=2013-03-26|language=Japanese}}</ref>

An [[Video game remake|enhanced remake]] was released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] in 1999 by Unbalance.

In 2014 the PC-88 version was released along with ''[[Sorcerian]]'' for the retro game distribution service EGG.<ref name=":1" />

== Reception ==
Upon release, four reviewers from ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of 19/40.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=|title=ロマンシア|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=20321&redirect=no|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116014329/https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=20321&redirect=no|archive-date=2021-01-16|access-date=|magazine=Famitsu|publisher=[[Enterbrain]]}}</ref>

The game has become notable for being cute but highly difficult.<ref name=":1" /> Subsequent reviewers complained about the lack of direction in the game given to the player and [[trial and error]] approach. There is no save function and the player may not be aware they have made a mistake. Starting over multiple times is required to advance in the game.<ref name=":2" />
