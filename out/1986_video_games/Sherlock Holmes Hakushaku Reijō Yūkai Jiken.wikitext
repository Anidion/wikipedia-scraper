==Gameplay==
[[Sherlock Holmes]] has to rescue a [[count]]ess, the daughter of an [[earl]], from an evil kidnapper. By travelling all over [[Great Britain]], he can collect the clues and defeat the thugs in order to conduct a thorough investigation.<ref name="mobygames"/>

Parks, sewers, and private houses provide clues needed to solve the mystery and bring the kidnapper to justice. Innocent citizens can also be kicked around just like criminals. Knives and guns can also be integrated into Holmes' offensive techniques, allowing him to collect money from fallen thugs. If Holmes is killed by any means, the mystery becomes a perfect crime, thus [[game over|terminating the game]].<ref name="mobygames"/>

During the game, players must collect a [[magnifying glass]] amongst other tools typically used by Sherlock Holmes. This game features urban violence; particularly in [[London]], which was seen as a "rowdy" city during the late Victorian era. Players can also encounter large groups of violent non-player characters in the "rough streets" of [[Birmingham]]. Determining enemy characters from innocent civilians is a challenging endeavor. Despite this, the game does not punish the player for firing a loaded weapon on a busy city street during the daytime hours.<ref>[http://www23.atwiki.jp/ksgmatome/pages/22.html Advanced information {{in lang|ja}}] at Wiki summary Kusoge</ref> Famous British landmarks offer important tidbits that permit the investigation to move forward.<ref>[http://www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown-Spade/4875/conquest/sherlock1_1.html Landmarks of ''Sherlock Holmes: Hakushaku Reijō Yūkai Jiken'' {{in lang|ja}}] at GeoCities.co.jp</ref>
