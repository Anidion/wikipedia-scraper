{{nihongo|'''''King Kong 2: Yomigaeru Densetsu'''''|キングコング2 甦る伝説|Kingu Kongu Tsū: Yomigaeru Densetsu|lit. "King Kong 2: Revived Legend"}} is a 1986 [[MSX2]] [[role-playing video game]] by [[Konami]]. It was released only in [[Japan]] and based on the movie of the same year, ''[[King Kong Lives]]'' (''King Kong 2'' being the film's title in Japan). Similar to Konami's later ''[[Hi no Tori]]'' games, two separate games were developed together and released for the MSX and Famicom respectively. While the Famicom ''[[King Kong 2: Ikari no Megaton Punch]]'' has players playing as King Kong in a more action-oriented format similar to Nintendo's ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''Yomigaeru Densetsu'' has players playing as Mitchell in a role-playing style.

The game was [[Copyright infringement|unofficially]] re-released in [[English language|English]] by the [[South Korea]]n company [[Zemina]] in 1987, as '''''킹콩II''''' (''King Kong II'').
