'''''Turbo Esprit''''' is a [[video game]] published by [[Durell Software]] in 1986 for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Amstrad CPC]]. The game was very detailed and advanced for its time, featuring car indicator lights, pedestrians, traffic lights, and a view of the car's interior controls. ''Turbo Esprit'' was the first free-roaming driving game,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-driving-game-to-feature-an-open-world-environment|title=First open-world driving videogame|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2018}}</ref> and has been cited as a major influence on the later ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series.<ref name="rg20">Retrorevival: Turbo Esprit, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' issue 20, page 48.

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to prevent a gang of drug smugglers completing a delivery of heroin, by tracking down their cars and destroying them, or ramming them into submission. The player takes the role of a special agent driving the titular [[Lotus Esprit]] car, which had been used in a [[For Your Eyes Only (film)|James Bond film]] a few years previously. The player must travel around one of four available cities looking for the criminals. Messages from HQ will flash up periodically giving the location of a target armoured car, which may then be tracked on the map. A courier car would then attempt to rendezvous with the armoured car to transfer the heroin, and the armoured car would then flee the city. Other courier cars would act as decoys.

Players could elect to wait until the drug transfer was complete before intercepting the armoured car, or instead attempt to find the one genuine courier car in order to prevent the transfer from taking place.

Once a drug dealer's car is found it can either be followed, destroyed with the Esprit's built-in machine gun, or repeatedly rammed until it surrenders. Different cars may need to be dealt with in different ways; for example armoured cars must be rammed as shooting has no effect, whereas randomly occurring "hit cars" are the only other vehicles that can match the Esprit for speed, so ramming them is more difficult. Following a drug dealer's car too closely may arouse suspicion and cause them to abort their mission.

Points are scored by apprehending the criminals. Additional points are awarded if they are captured alive (by disabling their car rather than destroying it), and if the heroin transfer has taken place (as there is now greater evidence of their crime).

Penalties are incurred for hitting scenery or other cars, and the player's car is likely to explode if it crashes into anything while travelling fast. As in real life, speeding greatly increases risk.<ref name="crash review">[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/28/tesprit.htm ''Turbo Esprit'' review], ''CRASH'', issue 28, pages 114–115. Newsfield Publications Ltd, 1986.</ref>

==Environment==
[[image:Turbo esprit cpc.png|thumb|200px|left|Traffic stops at the lights (Amstrad CPC version).]]
The game features four  [[open world|free-roaming]] cities (Wellington, Gamesborough, Minster and Romford) through which the player may drive as they see fit.<ref name="YS review">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305034530/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/turboesprit.htm ''Turbo Esprit'' review], ''[[Your Sinclair]]'', issue 6, pages 20–21. [[Dennis Publishing]], 1986.</ref> Each city features a [[grid plan]] of roads, and each is progressively more difficult; the first city contains many three lane roads making speeding and dodging traffic easy, whereas the later ones have more two-lane and one-way roads.

The cities contain many computer-controlled cars, all of which obey basic traffic laws, such as keeping below a set speed limit, stopping at the working traffic lights, moving out of the way of obstacles such as roadworks, and attempting to avoid head-on collisions with the player. They will also stop at [[zebra crossing]]s to allow waiting pedestrians to cross the road. Contact with or destruction of these cars results in score penalties.

The player's car can also run out of fuel, and so the player must stop at petrol stations to refill.

The Spanish version claims it to be set in the city of [[Manhattan]],<ref>''Turbo Esprit'' review, ''Microhobby'' (Spain), issue 76, page 15. April 1986.</ref> despite the fact that no changes were made to the game itself, which retains its British-style road markings and driving on the left.

==Development==
According to author Mike Richardson, ''Turbo Esprit'' took 10 months to develop, the longest time he ever spent on a single game.<ref name="retro gamer"/> It was developed with the cooperation of [[Lotus Cars|Lotus Cars Ltd.]], who provided "technical assistance".<ref>[ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-adverts/t/TurboEsprit_2.jpg ''Turbo Esprit'' press advertisement]{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 1986, at [[World of Spectrum]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Mason |first1=Graeme |title=The making of Turbo Esprit, the Spectrum game set in Romford that predated GTA |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-08-30-the-zx-spectrum-game-set-in-romford-that-predated-gta?fbclid=IwAR16C7MRJuGN4tfcxl0omi2bJ_HcsMCNxP095761VcZpjpaPaUPFEZKzxkM |website=Eurogamer |date=30 August 2020 |access-date=30 August 2020}}</ref>

''Turbo Esprit'' was generally well received by the gaming press, gaining positive reviews from most major gaming magazines. ''[[Sinclair User]]'' called it "one of the best games ever released",<ref>''Turbo Esprit'' budget re-release review, ''[[Sinclair User]]'', issue 86, page 56. [[EMAP]], May 1989.</ref> and it has since been described as "pioneering"<ref name="gameswipe"/> and "one of the Spectrum's best original games".<ref name="retro gamer">Discovering Durell, ''Retro Gamer'', issue 11, page 92. Live Publishing, 2003.</ref> The Spectrum version was voted number 64 in the ''[[Your Sinclair]] Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time|journal=Your Sinclair|date=September 1993}}</ref> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' magazine said of the game: "It was way ahead of its time and it could be argued that what you are looking at here is the genesis of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series", and that it "sealed Durell's reputation as a purveyor of quality software".<ref name="rg20"/>

The game reached number eight in the Gallup All-Formats charts and number one in the ZX Spectrum chart, replacing ''[[Movie_(video_game)|Movie]]''.<ref name='pcw27mar86charts'>{{cite magazine |title=Charts|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=13|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=27 March 1986|page=35|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2901&page=35|access-date=5 May 2023}}</ref>
