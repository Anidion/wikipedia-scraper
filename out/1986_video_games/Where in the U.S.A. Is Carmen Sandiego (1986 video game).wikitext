'''''Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?''''' is a video game that was released by [[Broderbund]] in 1986 and is part of the ''[[Carmen Sandiego (video game series)|Carmen Sandiego]]'' series. The game is a sequel to 1985's [[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985 video game)|''Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?'']]. A deluxe version with updated graphics and interface was released in 1992 and [[Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego? (1996 video game)|a remade version]] was released in 1996. The goal of the game is to track [[Carmen Sandiego (character)|Carmen Sandiego's]] henchmen across the United States, arrest them, and ultimately arrest Carmen herself. The game received generally positive reviews but some critics compared it unfavorably with its predecessor game, which had a global perspective.

== Development==
''Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?'', which focuses on United States geography, was produced as a sequel to ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985 video game)|Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'' due to the success of the previous game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/67863340/|title=The Daily Tar Heel from Chapel Hill, North Carolina on January 30, 1992 &middot; Page 15|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=April 23, 2017|language=en|archive-date=April 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424011628/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/67863340/|url-status=live}}</ref> It became the second entry in the ''[[Carmen Sandiego (video game series)|Carmen Sandiego]]'' franchise and would be followed by ''[[Where in Europe Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'' in 1988. ''Carmen Sandiego'' co-developer [[Doug Carlston]] followed a design philosophy that avoided explicit education. He wanted the game to feel like an explorational detective mystery that surreptitiously educated players on facts and figures while they chased and tried to capture Carmen, preventing the young audience from dismissing the game as boring or insincere.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/156322163/|title=Albuquerque Journal from Albuquerque, New Mexico on January 20, 1992 &middot; Page 37|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=April 23, 2017|language=en|archive-date=February 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227220557/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/156322163/|url-status=live}}</ref>

A [[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1996 video game)|rebooted version of the game]] was released in 1996; this version featured Lynne Thigpen in the role of The Chief, which she originated in the 1991–1996 televised game show [[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?

==Gameplay and plot==
[[File:Where_in_the_U.S.A._Is_Carmen_Sandiego?_DOS_CGA_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Original DOS version screenshot]]
The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985 video game)|Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]''. The goal of the game is to track Carmen's henchmen across the United States, arrest them, and ultimately arrest Carmen Sandiego, who has escaped from a European prison and has gone to the US to assemble a gang of V.I.L.E. members to steal the country's treasures.<ref name="CarmenUSA1986-CGazette">{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/details/1987-09-computegazette|title=Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego|date=September 1987|work=Compute!

The player, an agent of ACME Detective Agency, must gather information on the suspect and use it to obtain a warrant to reduce the potential suspects to one of the V.I.L.E. members in the database. The player must then track the criminal to the final destination and make an arrest. The player advances in rank throughout the game, eventually reaching the level of Super Sleuth. The player captures 16 of Carmen's crooks before having a chance to arrest her.<ref name="CarmenUSA1986-Allgame" />

The main screen interface is divided into four sections showing the day, time, and location; textual information, an image from the current city, and the available actions. The game was supplied with a special copy of ''[[Fodor's USA]]'' encyclopedia as a reference guide and a travel guide book.<ref name="CarmenUSA1986-CGazette" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/122424781/|title=Arizona Republic from Phoenix, Arizona on March 10, 1991 &middot; Page 159|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=April 23, 2017|language=en|archive-date=April 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424012018/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/122424781/|url-status=live}}</ref> The deluxe version of the game includes more than 50 digitized photographs, numerous state topographical maps, digitized sounds, and music.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/113116541/|title=The Courier-Journal from Louisville, Kentucky on August 22, 1993 &middot; Page 177|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=April 23, 2017|language=en|archive-date=April 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424002915/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/113116541/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Critics gave ''Where in the USA Is Carmen Sandiego?'' positive reviews, although many reviews negatively compared it with its predecessor. The smaller scope of ''Where in the U.S.A....'' may have reduced its relevance for potential players who lived outside the United States.

In 1987, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' complimented the game as a valuable tool for teaching geography, reference book use, map reading, and deductive reasoning.<ref name="proctor198707">{{cite news | title=Educational Games From Broderbund | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June–July 1987 | last=Proctor |first=Bob | page=26}}</ref> ''[[Compute!'s Gazette|Compute!

''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''Where in the USA Is Carmen Sandiego?'', calling it a "lively and challenging way to practice map-reading skills ...

Jean Donham van Deusen, co-author of ''Teaching With Computers: A New Menu for the Nineties'', ranked the program highly, praised its ability to foster social interaction between players, and wrote that the game overcomes a misconception about computer playing being a solitary activity and that with ''Where in the USA Is Carmen Sandiego?'', the player is in charge of the experience.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/152582085/|title=Reno Gazette-Journal from Reno, Nevada on December 6, 1991 &middot; Page 55|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=April 23, 2017|language=en|archive-date=April 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424010336/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/152582085/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' wrote that the game offers a fun way for players to learn about United States geography.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/141486763/|title=St. Louis Post-Dispatch from St. Louis, Missouri on October 27, 1991 &middot; Page 625|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=April 23, 2017|language=en|archive-date=April 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424013533/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/141486763/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Tennessean]]'' said the game's appeal was age-based and that it was unlikely that children who were ten or younger would enjoy the game's challenges.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/112837634/|title=The Tennessean from Nashville, Tennessee on November 8, 1995 &middot; Page 23|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=April 23, 2017|language=en|archive-date=April 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424002923/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/112837634/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Tar Heel]]'' noted the game's importance in "a society where most pupils can't identify their home state on a map".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/67863340/|title=The Daily Tar Heel from Chapel Hill, North Carolina on January 30, 1992 &middot; Page 15|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=April 23, 2017|language=en|archive-date=April 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424011628/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/67863340/|url-status=live}}</ref>
