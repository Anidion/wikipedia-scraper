{{nihongo foot|'''''The Wing of Madoola'''''|マドゥーラの翼|Madūra no Tsubasa|lit. "Wings of Madoola"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1986 [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Sunsoft]] for the [[Family Computer]]. It stars Lucia, a magic-wielding warrior of the Rameru clan. Darutos, a descendant of the Rameru line, found the Wing of Madoola statue and used it to build a demonic fortress and summon demons to conquer the world. Lucia must retrieve the statue and stop Darutos. Throughout the journey, the player explores and search for [[Item (gaming)|item]]s and [[power-up]]s to increase Lucia's attributes, while fighting enemies and defeating [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]].

''The Wing of Madoola'' was designed by Kenji Sada, being his first project at Sunsoft after joining the company in 1986, and developed over the course of six months. Sada acted as the game's main programmer, planner, and team lead. He intended to make an action game and choose a female lead for the game, a decision he felt gave character to the title. Artist Kenji "Moriken" Mori acted as character designer. The music was composed by Naoki Kodaka, with assistance by sound programmer Naohisa Morota.

''The Wing of Madoola'' garnered mixed reception from critics and retrospective commentarists. The game was supplemented with [[manga]] adaptations and music albums. The character of Lucia would make appearances in other titles, including a [[doujinshi]] [[adventure game]] released for [[Personal computer|PC]] in 2009, and became a popular [[Sunsoft]] character among Japanese retro gaming fans.

''The Wing of Madoola'' is a side-scrolling [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platform]] game with  [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements, similar to ''[[Athena (video game)|Athena]]'' (1986).<ref name="TWoMhg101"/><ref name=":0"/><ref name="PGoNF">{{cite book|chapter=マドゥーラの翼|title=懐かしファミコンパーフェクトガイド|volume=1|series=Perfect Guide|publisher=Magazine Box|date=April 21, 2016|page=41|language=ja|isbn=978-4906735891}}</ref> The story is set in the kingdom of Badham, which hosted a bird statue known as the Wing of Madoola. The wing grants power to rule the world to the one who possessed it, which caused many wars between nations to have control over it. A king hid it to stop the wars and entrusted the Rameru family to protect the wing. Darutos, a descendant of the Rameru lineage, found the statue and betrayed his family by using it to build a demonic fortress and summon demons to conquer the world.

''The Wing of Madoola'' was developed over the course of six months.<ref name="SoM"/> Sada intended to make an action game instead of a [[action role-playing game]]. Sada choose a female lead for the game, stating that the game would have been very similar to ''[[Dragon Buster]]'' if the protagoinist was a male. Sada did not have a specific reason for choosing making a woman the protagonist, but felt the decision gave the game character.<ref name=":0"/> Sugiura conceived the game's title, though he explained the name had no meaning and jokingly explained that "I was just doodling because I liked the balance of the characters."<ref name=":0"/><ref name="Friday"/>
