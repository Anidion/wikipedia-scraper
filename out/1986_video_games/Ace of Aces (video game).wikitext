'''''Ace of Aces''''' is a [[combat flight simulation game]] developed by [[Artech Digital Entertainment]] and published in 1986 by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] in North America and [[U.S. Gold]] in Europe.<ref name="computebestseller"/><ref name="usgoldrelease">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/companies/us-gold|title=U.S. Gold Games|publisher=[[IGN]]|access-date=16 June 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616115015/http://www.ign.com/companies/us-gold|archive-date=16 June 2016}}</ref> It was released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Master System]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. Set in World War II, the player flies a [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] long range [[fighter-bomber]] equipped with [[rocket]]s, [[bomb]]s and a cannon. Missions include destroying German fighter planes, [[bomber]]s, [[V-1 flying bomb]]s, [[U-boat]]s, and [[train]]s. In 1988, [[Atari Corporation]] released a version on cartridge for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] styled for the then-new [[Atari XEGS]].

''Ace of Aces'' received mixed reviews but went on to become one of the best-selling Commodore 64 video games published by Accolade.<ref name="computebestseller"/> The game sold 100,000 units.<ref>{{cite web|first=Burnaby|last=B.C|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/89676520/edmonton-journal/|title=Investment in home computer helped turn teen into a tycoon|newspaper=[[Edmonton Journal]]|page=10|date=June 24, 1991|accessdate=November 28, 2021|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Ace_of_Aces_(video_game)_Atari_8-bit_PAL_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot (Atari 8-bit)]]
Upon launching the game a menu screen with options to either practice or partake in a proper mission is shown. If the player decides to do the practice mode, they can choose whether to do [[dog fight]] training or a [[U-boat]] or [[train]] bombing. When playing the practice mode, the enemies are less aggressive. There are five different view options — the [[cockpit]], both left and right [[Wing configuration|wings]], the navigational map and the [[bomb bay]] — which can be accessed by using the keyboard or by double-tapping the fire button and moving the joystick to the desired direction.<ref name="zzapissue020">{{cite web|date=December 1986|title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 020|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-020/ZZap_64_Issue_020_1986_Dec#page/n147/mode/1up|publisher=[[ZZap!64]]|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref>

When in missions, the player controls a [[twinjet|twin-engined]] [[balsa]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]]<ref name="cavgmissue062">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-video-games-magazine-062/CVG062_Dec_1986#page/n22/mode/1up|title=Computer and Video Games Magazine Issue 062|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|work=[[Computer and Video Games]]|access-date=15 June 2016|date=December 1986}}</ref> which is already airborne, mitigating the necessity of takeoff. When starting a mission, the player chooses what supplies they wish to bring, but the more the player brings the lower the maximum speed of the plane. At the end of missions, landing is not required and points are awarded according to how many enemies are shot down, along with the amount of unused fuel, bombs, and missiles.

When missions are completed, the player can choose to combine two or more of the other missions to produce a mashup.<ref name="computergamerissue22">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gamer_Issue_22_1987-01_Argus_Press_GB#page/n21/mode/1up|title=Computer Gamer – Issue 22 (1987-01)|access-date=15 June 2016|work=[[Computer Gamer]]|publisher=[[Argus Specialist Publications]]|date=January 1987}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Commodore 64===
In a 1987 ''[[Compute!]]'' article, ''Ace of Aces'' was noted as [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]'s second best selling Commodore 64 game.<ref name="computebestseller">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-12-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_54_1987_Dec#page/n17/mode/2up | title=The Commodore Games That Live On And On | work=Compute's Gazette | date=December 1987 | accessdate=24 January 2015 | author=Ferrell, Keith | pages=18–22}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'', along with other reviewers, praised the graphics and sound in ''Ace of Aces''.<ref name="bateman198610">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-10-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_077_1986_Oct#page/n19/mode/2up | title=A Great Year For Games | work=Compute! | date=October 1986 | accessdate=9 November 2013 | author=Bateman, Selby | pages=18}}</ref> 1991 and 1993 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' surveys of strategy and war games gave it one and a half stars out of five, calling it "somewhat ahistorical".<ref name="brooks199111">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=88 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: The 1900–1950 Epoch / Part I (A-L) of an Annotated Paiktography | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

Evan | pages=118}}</ref> In issue 20 of ''[[Zzap!64]]'', the reviewer said it was the best factual war simulation they had played. They compared it to ''[[The Dam Busters (video game)|Dambusters]]'' and said the playability in this was better. ''[[Desert Fox (video game)|Desert Fox]]'' was also used as a comparison, which was referred to as "sometimes unbelievable".<ref name="zzapissue020"/> An article by the ''[[Computer and Video Games magazine]]'' published in 1986 said that it was another well-made and well-presented game by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] and continued to say that the action-packed gameplay would be able to keep "even the most critical computer pilot busy for some time to come". All four criteria were highly rated, with graphics getting a 10, along with sound, value and playability all getting an 8.<ref name="cavgmissue062"/>

===Master System===
The graphics, along with sound and other features which were highly praised in the Commodore 64 version weren't so highly acclaimed in the Master System version.<ref name="gamescollectionreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamescollection.it/reviews/show/272|title=Ace Of Aces|website=gamescollection.it|date=14 September 2008|access-date=15 June 2016|language=Italian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815035801/http://www.gamescollection.it/reviews/show/272|archive-date=2016-08-15|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="meanmachinesreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/review/183/ace-of-aces.php|title=Ace of Aces review – Sega Master System|archive-date=16 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616074131/http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/review/183/ace-of-aces.php|first=Michael|last=Larkin|work=Mean Machines Mag|date=18 August 2010}}</ref> Chad Reinhardt for ''Defunct Games'' mentioned that ''Ace of Aces'' starts with potential but the poor controls and lack of ability to interact with the plane makes it forgettable. Reinhardt criticised how different the practise mode was from the main game and continued by adding how little help it actually helps when attempting missions. He gave the game a D+ overall.<ref name="defunctgamersreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.defunctgames.com/review/630/ace-of-aces|title=Ace of Aces Review for Master System|first=Chad|last=Reinhardt|date=25 December 2005|website=Defunct Games|access-date=16 June 2016|archive-date=16 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616073850/http://www.defunctgames.com/review/630/ace-of-aces}}</ref> Other reviewers commented that there was no feeling of excitement when playing the Sega version.<ref name="meanmachinesreview"/> In a review on ''Kultboy'', it was given a rating of 20% and said the reasoning behind the low review was because the plane, which is meant to be a [[fighter plane]], flies like a [[Aerial refueling|tanker]]. Comparatively the score for graphics the game was given was high, with 68%.<ref name="kultboyreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=8068|title=Ace of Aces – Schlafpille im schleichflug|language=German|access-date=16 June 2016|work=Kultboy.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616080132/http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=8068|archive-date=16 June 2016}}</ref> ''[[Sega Pro]]'' gave the game a rating of 56 and praised the graphics when they were static but continued on to say they were impractical in-game.<ref name="segaproissue1">{{cite web|url=http://retrocdn.net/images/7/75/SegaPro_UK_01.pdf#page=18|pages=18|title=SegaPro UK Issue 01|work=[[Sega Pro]]|publisher=Paragon Publishing|date=November 1991|access-date=16 June 2016}}</ref>

===Other platforms===
The [[ZX Spectrum]] version was met with reviews disliking the complexity of changing controls and how it may be distracting during a [[dogfight]].<ref name="computergamerissue27">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gamer_Issue_27_1987-06_Argus_Press_GB#page/n21/mode/1up|title=Computer Gamer – Issue 27|pages=22|access-date=16 June 2016|work=[[Computer Gamer]]|date=June 1987 |publisher=[[Argus Specialist Publications]]}}</ref> In issue 38 of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'', reviewers Ben Stone, Paul Sumner and Mike Dunn criticised the difficulty of the game and how the game only contains enough gameplay for a few days.<ref name="ysissue38overview">{{cite web|url=http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/review.aspx?gid=97&rid=6613|title=Ace of Aces|website=ZX Spectrum Reviews|access-date=16 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616084407/http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/review.aspx?gid=97&rid=6613|archive-date=16 June 2016}}</ref><ref name="ysissue38">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-38/YourSinclair_38_Feb_1989#page/n0/mode/1up|title=Your Sinclair Magazine Issue 38|access-date=16 June 2016|work=[[Your Sinclair]]|date=February 1989 |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]}}</ref> Steve Panak, writing for ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'', preferred ''Ace of Aces'' to ''[[Infiltrator (video game)|Infiltrator]]'' as an Atari 8-bit flight simulator.<ref name="analogreview">{{cite news|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/analog/issue64/panak.php|title=Panak Strikes|work=[[ANALOG Computing]]|date=September 1988|accessdate=16 June 2016|last=Panak|first=Steve|pages=83}}</ref> Atari 7800 Forever only gave a 2.5 out of 5, but ranked it as the best flight simulator for the system.<ref name="Funkmaster V">{{cite web |last1= Funkmaster V|title=REVIEW: Ace of Aces |website=Atari 7800 Forever |url=http://www.atari7800forever.com/aceofacesreview.html}}</ref>
