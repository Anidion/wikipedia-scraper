The player controls the Molecule Man in his quest to escape within a time limit. He must find the teleport and repair it using 16 circuit board pieces that are scattered around the maze. Bombs must be purchased to blow open inaccessible areas. Meanwhile, the radiation is killing him and health pills must be purchased to prolong his life.

Coins can be found lying around. These must be collected and taken to dispensers to purchase bombs and pills.

==Reception==
''ZX Computing'' wrote, "No not another 3-D maze game! 'Fraid so".<ref name="ZX Computing Review">{{cite journal |title=Molecule Man Review |journal=ZX Computing |date=September 1986}}</ref> A 1986 review for ''[[Sinclair User]]'' was more positive:

{{quote|It's a little bit of ''Cylu'', it's a bit [[Ultimate Play the Game|Ultimate]], it's a bit like quite a few other games, but ''Molecule Man'' is still wonderful... Around six months ago quite a few programmers seemed to discover surrealism as a way of life, programs started to be filled with objects normally not associated with one another - ''[[Sweevo's World|Sweevo]]'' with its little girls, odd fowl and tropical fruit is one memorable example. ''Molecule Man'' belongs to the same surrealist school of graphics design... a very entertaining, fairly original and addictive game<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{cite journal |title=Molecule Man Review |journal=Sinclair User |date=August 1986}}</ref>}}
