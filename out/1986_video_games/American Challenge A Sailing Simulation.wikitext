'''''The American Challenge: A Sailing Simulation''''' is a 1986 [[sailing simulation]] and racing game developed by [[Tom Snyder Productions]] and published by [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]].

== Gameplay ==
The game, portrayed through wireframe 3D graphics, sees the player race against the computer or another player via modem on eight courses. The player controls the sail, rudder and centerboard, while the screen equipment monitor the wind speed and direction.<ref name=nytimes/> The boat responds realistically to the player's movements.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mindscape-product-catalog|title=Mindscape Product Catalog|last=Mindscape Inc.|date=1985}}</ref> The game is fashioned after the America's Cup. Players were able to verse players at other computer via a direct serial connection, and could verse themselves to beat their own time.<ref name=":1" /> Players can take the American Challenge by trying to beat the Australian team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stadium64.com/gameinfos/americanchallenge/americanchallenge.htm|title=Stadium 64 - Game Infos: American Challenge, The - A Sailing Simulation|website=www.stadium64.com|access-date=2019-01-14}}</ref>

== Development ==
The game was shipped with a cassette that featured a sailing tutorial on one side and a song named 'Win Back the Cup" on the other.

There was a challenge whereby if a player was able to beat Australia in the program's Cup Race, they become eligible for a contest to win a trip to Australia to watch the 1987 America's Cup races.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Tony|date=September 1986|title=The American Challenge: A Sailing Simulation|url=https://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue76/Reviews_2.php|journal=Compute!|issue=76|pages=46}}</ref>

Russell Sipe reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "For sailor/gamers this program is an absolute must. Non-sailor/gamers will also find it to be a good value and may learn some valuable "ground school" sailing techniques."<ref name="CGW36">{{cite magazine |last=Wilson |first=Johnny |title=Gone with the Wind |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1987 |volume=1 |issue=36 |pages=29–31}}</ref>
