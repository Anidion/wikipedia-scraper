'''''Spindizzy''''' is an [[isometric projection|isometric]] video game released for several [[8-bit]] home computers in 1986 by [[Electric Dreams Software]]. It combines [[Action game|action]] and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle video game]] elements. Players must navigate a series of screens to explore a landscape suspended in a three-dimensional space. Development was headed by Paul Shirley, who drew inspiration from [[Ultimate Play the Game]] games that feature an isometric projection.

The game was successful in the United Kingdom and was well received by the video game press. Reviewers praised its visuals and design, but criticized its audio. Similarities were drawn to ''[[Marble Madness]]'', which was released in arcades two years earlier. ''Spindizzy'' was followed by a 1990s sequel titled ''[[Spindizzy Worlds]]''.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Spindizzy-Gameplay.png|thumb|left|alt=Horizontal rectangle video game screenshot that is a digital representation of a three dimensional path.|The player controls a probe to explore an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] stage. Game statistics (remaining time, collected jewels, and remaining stages) are tracked at the top. The [[ZX Spectrum]] version is pictured.]]

''Spindizzy'' is an [[Action game|action]] and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] [[Video games with isometric graphics|played from an isometric perspective]]. Players can view the playing field from four angles, and rotate between them. The game takes place in a fictional landscape of interconnected stages suspended in a dimensional space.The player controls a probe called a Gyroscopic Environmental Reconnaissance And Land-Mapping Device (GERALD), via keyboard commands or a joystick. The craft is able to transform between three configurations: a ball, an inverted [[square pyramid]], and a [[gyroscope]], although the difference between each configuration is only visual. Players navigate the probe through the stages to explore the world within a time limit. The time limit can be extended by collecting power jewels scattered through the world and is decreased by falling off a stage. Stages feature ramps, corridors, and other obstacles that hinder the player from quickly traversing them. The game ends when time expires or the world is completely explored.<ref name="ZZAP-14">{{cite journal| journal = [[Zzap!64]]| title = ''Zzap!

== Development and release ==

''Spindizzy'' was developed by Paul Shirley of British video game developer [[Electric Dreams Software]]. He was primarily inspired by [[Ultimate Play the Game]] games that feature an [[isometric projection]], but was also influenced by the gameplay of the 1984 arcade game ''[[Marble Madness]]''. Shirley created an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] script to generate the game's levels. The script allowed him to design a large number of stages using 11[[Kilobyte|KB]] of storage. The game was originally released for the [[Amstrad CPC]]<ref name='ace9'>{{cite magazine |title=The Third Dimension – Isometric 3D Games|magazine=ACE|issue=9|publisher=Future Publishing|date=June 1988|page=85|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=1735&page=85|access-date=17 January 2023}}</ref> and later [[porting|ported]] to [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] computers.<ref name="Halcyon">{{cite book| title = [[Halcyon Days (book)|Halcyon Days]]: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Games Programmers| editor = James Hague| year = 1997| chapter = Paul Shirley| publisher = Dadgum Games| chapter-url = https://dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/SHIRLEY.HTM}}</ref> Copies of ''Spindizzy'' were promoted as prizes in magazine contests upon its release.<ref>{{cite journal|date=July 1986|title=''Spindizzy'' Competition|url=https://archive.org/details/ComputerAndVideoGamesIssue057Jul86|journal=[[Computer and Video Games]]|publisher=[[EMAP]]|issue=57|page=[https://archive.org/details/ComputerAndVideoGamesIssue057Jul86/page/n30 72]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=August 1986|title=A Really Rather Big Competition|url=https://archive.org/details/your-sinclair-08|journal=[[Your Sinclair]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issue=8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/your-sinclair-08/page/n39 38]–39}}</ref> American video game company [[Activision]] published the game in the United States as part of its "Electric Dreams" series.<ref name="Compute-77">{{cite journal|last=Bateman|first=Selby|date=October 1986|title=A Great Year For Games|url=https://archive.org/details/1986-10-compute-magazine/page/n19/mode/2up|journal=[[Compute!]]|publisher=[[Small System Services]]|issue=77|page=18}}</ref> John Sanderson programmed the Apple II version; Shirley was unaware of the port's existence until the mid-1990s.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="Moby">{{cite web| url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/spindizzy| title = ''Spindizzy'' – MobyGames| publisher = [[MobyGames]]| access-date = 2010-01-18}}</ref> ''Spindizzy'' was later re-released as part of an Activision compilation.<ref>{{cite journal|date=April 1991|title=''Spindizzy''|url=https://archive.org/details/your-sinclair-64/page/n7/mode/2up|journal=[[Your Sinclair]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issue=64|page=8}}</ref> The company sold ''Spindizzy''{{'}}s compilation rights not long after obtaining them, which reduced the amount of royalties to Shirley and Electric Dreams.

Shirley described the game's marketing life as short and attributed that to Activision's business practices. James Hague of Dadgum Games commented that ''Spindizzy'' could have been an "all-time classic" had it received a proper marketing campaign.<ref name="Halcyon"/> Despite this, ''Spindizzy'' sold well in the United Kingdom<ref name="Compute-77"/> reaching the number one position in the Amstrad charts in March 1986.<ref name='pcwcharts100486'>{{cite magazine |title=Charts|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=15|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=10 April 1986|page=35|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2903&page=27|access-date=17 January 2023}}</ref> The Commodore and Spectrum versions also reached their Top 10 charts on their release several weeks later, taking the game to the number 2 position in the all formats chart.<ref name='pcwcharts150586'>{{cite magazine |title=Charts|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=20|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=15 May 1986|page=46|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2908&page=46|access-date=17 January 2023}}</ref><ref name='pcwcharts220586'>{{cite magazine |title=Charts|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=21|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=22 May 1986|page=46|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2909&page=46|access-date=17 January 2023}}</ref>

The game was well received by video game journalists upon its release. ''[[Zzap!64]]'' awarded ''Spindizzy'' a Gold Medal.<ref name="ZZAP-14"/> Tony Hetherington of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' listed it as one of the essential Spectrum titles of 1986.<ref name="CG-17">{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Tony|date=August 1986|title=The Spectrum Collection Update|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_17_1986-08_Argus_Press_GB|journal=[[Computer Gamer]]|publisher=[[Argus Press|Argus Specialist Publications]]|issue=17|page=[https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_17_1986-08_Argus_Press_GB/page/n68 14]}}</ref>

Praise from reviewers focused on the game's visuals and design, while criticism focused on the audio. Three of ''Zzap!64''{{'}}s reviewers—[[Julian Rignall]], [[Gary Liddon]], and [[Gary Penn]]—called the graphics "amazing", well-executed, and "varied"; but they described the audio as sparse. Rignall and Penn complimented the challenging gameplay and commented that its addictiveness outweighed any frustration experienced while playing. The three summarized by urging readers to purchase the game.<ref name="ZZAP-14"/> ''Computer Gamer'' reviewer Mike Roberts praised ''Spindizzy''{{'}}s gameplay, but mentioned that the screen's orientation can require a period of adjustment, particularly when using a [[joystick]].<ref name="CG-13">{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Mike|date=April 1986|title=''Spindizzy''|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_13_1986-04_Argus_Press_GB/page/n29/mode/2up|journal=[[Computer Gamer]]|publisher=[[Argus Press|Argus Specialist Publications]]|issue=13|pages=30–31}}</ref> ''Crash''{{'}}s reviewer called ''Spindizzy'' "one of the most addictive" ZX Spectrum games, noting its innovative use of shape changing, multiple view angles, and speed control.

Reviewers drew comparisons to ''Marble Madness'', which was ported to home platforms the same year. Roberts called ''Spindizzy'' the "best 'marble' game yet",<ref name="CG-13"/> and [[Charles Ardai]] of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called it "a thoroughly enjoyable game" superior to ''Marble Madness''.<ref name="ardai198707">{{cite magazine|last=Ardai|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Ardai|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_38.pdf|title=Titans of the Computer Gaming World / Part Three of Five: Ardai on Activision|date=June–July 1987|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|issue=38|pages=36}}</ref> South described ''Spindizzy'' as the "closest thing yet to ''Marble Madness''" on the ZX Spectrum, while Liddon said that any similarities to ''Marble Madness'' were coincidental.<ref name="ZZAP-14"/><ref name="YS-7"/> Many publications commented that the game was obviously inspired by ''Marble Madness''.<ref name="Crash-29"/><ref>{{cite journal|date=July 1986|title=''Spindizzy''|url=https://archive.org/details/ZX-computing-1986-07|journal=ZX Computing Monthly|publisher=[[Argus Press|Argus Specialist Publications]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/ZX-computing-1986-07/page/n64 65]|editor=Bryan Ralph}}</ref><ref name="YS-6">{{cite journal| journal = [[Your Sinclair]]| publisher = [[Dennis Publishing]]| title = Frontlines| date = June 1986| issue = 6| page = 13| url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-06/YourSinclair_06_Jun_1986#page/n13/mode/2up}}</ref><ref name="Retro-53">{{cite journal|last=Grannell|first=Craig|date=August 2008|title=The Making of ''Marble Madness''|url=https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_053#page/n81/mode/2up|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=53|pages=82–87}}</ref> In 1993, ''[[Commodore Force]]'' ranked the game at number ten on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Ton!|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-101/ZZap_64_Issue_101_Commodore_Force_Issue_11_1993_Autumn#page/n32/mode/1up/|website=Commodore Force|date=Autumn 1993|accessdate=2017-09-03|page=33}}</ref>
