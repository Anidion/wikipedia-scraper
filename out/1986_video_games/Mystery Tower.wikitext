{{Nihongo foot|'''''Tower of Babel'''''|バベルの塔|Babel no Tō|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is a [[puzzle-platform video game]] developed and published by [[Namco]] for the [[Famicom|Family Computer]] in Japan on July 18, 1986. It was released on the [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] in 2014. While the game remained exclusive to Japan for several years, it received its first worldwide release on June 5, 2023 via [[Nintendo Switch Online]], under the name '''''Mystery Tower'''''.

The game's goal is to solve the puzzle of each of the 64 levels of the ancient [[Tower of Babel]] and reach the top of the tower. The player controls the protagonist, Indy Borgnine, who must avoid enemies while rearranging L-shaped blocks in order to reach each level's exit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/babel-no-t|title=Babel no Tō (1986)|website=MobyGames|access-date=January 29, 2020}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2020}}

Development was done by Namco, and the project was planned by Hiroshima Nagashima, who had worked on the company's [[arcade game]] ''[[Sky Kid]]'' (1985), the music was by Norio Nakagata, and the character design was by Hiroshi Fuji.

== Gameplay ==
The player controls Indy Borgnine through 64 levels, using L-shaped blocks and vines in order to reach the exit of each level. On some levels, the exit is blocked by a mask, and there are crystal balls throughout the level. If all of the crystal balls on a level are collected, then the mask covering that level's exit will disappear, and the exit will no longer be blocked. When the exit of a level is reached, a screen is displayed showing the score achieved on that level before the character moves on to the next level. In the top right corner of the screen there is a power count. Lifting an L-shaped block causes the power count to go down by 1. Items will occasionally spawn while the player goes through the tower. The items are:
* Pots (100 points and add 1 to power count)
* Crowns (200 points)
* Jewels (400 points and invincibility; enemies killed while invincible are worth 1000 points)
* Lamps (1000 points and enable Indy Borgnine to pass through L-shaped blocks)
* Stars (increase Indy Borgnine's speed)

== Plot ==
Archaeologist and explorer Indy Borgnine is in search of the fabled [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]. After reading some lost scriptures, he determines that the only way to see them is to travel to the very top of the 64-story [[Tower of Babel]] from the [[Book of Genesis]] of the [[Old Testament]]. Upon reaching the Tower, he discovers that the only way to access the floors above him are to solve some challenging puzzles involving loose L-shaped blocks that he finds throughout the Tower. To his great surprise, the blocks are capable of balancing very well on top of one another, in order to form staircases.
