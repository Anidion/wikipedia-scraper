# Clown's Counting Games - the player is required to count with a number as a guide to pitch the tone of the musical instrument.
# Tightrope Game - the player has to help Reader Rabbit match a picture of objects with a displaying number and discard the pictures that don't match.
# Circus Train Game - the player has complete a sequence of numbers each being added to a particular number. 
# Mystery Matching Game - the player has to match turn over cards and find matching pictures of items and corresponding numbers.

Since ''Math Rabbit Deluxe'', the games were retitled "Calliope Counting Game", "Tightrope Show", "Sea Lion Show", and "Balloon Matching Game", respectively, but the game objectives and rules remain the same.

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the game was "sweet", though ''Millie's Math House'' made it "look kind of buttoned-down".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sunila |first=Joyce |date=October 15, 1993 |title=SOFTWARE REVIEW: Education Made Fun: New computer programs employ adventure and games of skill to help youngsters learn math. |language=en-US |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |department=Technology and the Internet |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-10-15-va-46204-story.html |url-status=live |access-date=January 2, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918164301/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-15/news/va-46204_1_math-software |archive-date=September 18, 2016 |issn=0458-3035}}</ref> FOGG praised the easy-to-use gaming interface,<ref name=":0" /> and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said it is "entertaining"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sussman |first=Vic |date=November 1, 1987 |title=A Guide For Parents Series: Education Review |page=R09GUI |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?p=sa&NS=16&AID=9UNI005200&an=wp00000020011118djb102ooh&drn=drn:archive.newsarticle.wp00000020011118djb102ooh&cat=a&ep=asi |url-status= |archive-url= |archive-date= |issn=0190-8286 |id=Document wp00000020011118djb102ooh |postscript=.
