Taking the part of Burt, the "Universal Hero", the player must repair a space shuttle in order to make their way to a planet where they can pick up the spare parts needed to mend a space freighter which is out of control and on-course to destroy both Burt and his chances of returning to Earth. The player explores a [[flip-screen]] environment, avoiding enemies and solving simple puzzles by finding objects that need to be used in the correct locations to proceed.

A bug in the Atari 8-bit version password screen makes the game impossible to complete.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

A reviewer for ''Computer+Video Games'' wrote, in October 1987, "Arcade adventures must be the second most popular type of game, after shoot'em ups, and this budget title offers most of the features you could wish for, including odd objects to collect and strength sapping aliens to avoid."<ref name="cvgreview">Universal Hero short review in Computer+Video Games issue oct. 1987, p. 34, ISSN 0261-3697 [https://archive.org/details/computer-video-games-magazine-072/page/n33 here]</ref>

''[[Sinclair User]]'' commented, "It's getting very difficult to find exciting ways of describing games which essentially repeat the same formula over and over again," but also "''Hero'' is considerably better than most of the competition."<ref name=taylor/>
