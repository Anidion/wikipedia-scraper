'''''Peter Shilton's Handball Maradona''''' (referred to in title as '''''Peter Shilton's Football''''') is a multiplatform [[association football]] [[simulation video game]] that was released in 1986 for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. The game's title refers to the [[The hand of God|"hand of God" goal]] scored by [[Diego Maradona]] against England at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name="mobygames"/>

==Gameplay==
[[File:PeterShiltonsHandballMaradonaScreenshotZXSpectrum.png|250px|thumb|In this typical match, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] are defeating [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] by a score of 2â€“0.]]
While the game is ostensibly a [[association football|football]] [[Simulation video game|simulation]] video game, it differs from other football games in that the player only ever controls the [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]: instead of playing a full match, the player is presented with a number of preset scenarios (such as a standard attack, or a set piece like a [[corner kick]] or [[penalty kick]]) where the player is expected to save the shot on goal - to do this, the player can move freely within the [[six yard box]], and jump or dive sideways.<ref name="zzap"/> Once the shot is saved - or the goal is conceded - the play stops and the game goes on to the next scenario.

The game features three game modes centered around the core mechanic: 
* In Practice Session mode, the player is simply presented with a series of attacks they must save, but score isn't kept.<ref name="zzap"/>
* In Play Game mode, the action happens within the confines of a football match, with two [[Half-time|halves]] and a final score;<ref name="zzap"/> while not seen, the player's team is able to score goals as well, but much like real life, as a goalkeeper, the player can only ensure their team doesn't concede any goals, and has no influence on whether their team scores any.
* In Skill Upgrade mode, the player has to save four consecutive shots to get to a higher skill level, after which the attacks get progressively more difficult to save. If successful, the player receives a 4-digit code they can enter the next time they start the game to resume from that skill level.<ref name="zzap"/>

The player must pick one of sixteen teams of the [[Football League First Division]], although no player names or team colours are featured.

The Commodore 64 version has some extra [[sound effect]]s and some limited [[Speech synthesis|digitized speech]].<ref name="mobygames"/><ref>[http://s64.emuunlim.org:88/reviews/petershiltonshandballmaradona.htm Peter Shilton's Handball Maradona] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726031836/http://s64.emuunlim.org:88/reviews/petershiltonshandballmaradona.htm |date=2011-07-26 }}, s64.emuunlim.org:88</ref>

==Reception==
[[All Media Network#AllGame|AllGame]] gave the game a score of 2.5/5 stars.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Writing for [[Zzap!64]], [[Julian Rignall]] judged the game as "vastly overpriced and not really worth buying", noting that while the core gameplay was fun, the repetitive nature didn't provide enough replay value.<ref name="zzap">{{cite magazine |date=1987-03-01|title=Peter Shilton's Handball Maradona (Argus Press) Review|url=https://www.everygamegoing.com/larticle/Peter-Shiltons-Handball-Maradona-000/40185|magazine=[[Zzap!64]]|issue=23|author=[[Julian Rignall]]}}</ref>
