'''''Calorie Kun vs Moguranian''''' is a [[platform game]] developed by [[Vic Tokai]] and published by [[Sega]] as an [[arcade video game]] in 1986.

==Gameplay==
The player controls "Calorie-Kun" an abstract, mole-like creature that must make its way around a number of tunnels with ladders, avoiding enemies and collecting the items placed around the screen; before quickly making its way to the exit. The player is armed with a limited number of bombs that can be used to destroy or disable enemies.

Calorie-kun faces a timer in the form of a calorie counter which is slowly counting down and may be replenished by fruit and other food items scattered throughout the level. If allowed to drop too low, Calorie-kun will grow anemic and slow down considerably. If raised too high too quickly, Calorie-kun instead becomes too fat to move around in most tunnels until the counter drops again, or may even explode if the counter reaches an extreme.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Calorie Kun vs. Moguranian'' on their October 1, 1986 issue as being the tenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=293|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 October 1986|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>
