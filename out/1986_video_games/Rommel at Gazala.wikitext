==Reception==
Stating that "Simulations Canada is filling a necessary niche in the hobby", ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1987 stated that "there is much to learn in this interesting perspective on the desert war".<ref name="cgw198711">{{cite magazine | title=Christmas Buyers Guide | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=November 1987 | pages=20 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_41/page/n19/mode/2up |issue=41}}</ref> The magazine's Johnny L. Wilson stated that "''RAG'' is a successful utilization of the SimCan design philosophy, but whether it is worth the price is dependent upon whether you buy into that philosophy or not. At least, the specialized requirements of this model fit the SimCan design better than most of their land-based games".<ref name="CGW40">{{cite magazine |last=Wilson |first=Johnny L. |title=Outfoxed in the Desert: Simulations Canada's "Rommel At Gazala" |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1987 |volume=1 |issue=40 |pages=20â€“21}}</ref>
