==Gameplay==
[[File:Arcticfox_Atari_ST_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot (Atari ST)]]
The [[Player character|player]] must pilot the tank into enemy territory with the goal of knocking out the alien base. The player uses the tank's abilities to destroy the aliens' ships and equipment. The Arcticfox tank is equipped with a [[cannon]], [[guided missile]]s, [[land mine]]s, and is outfitted with [[radar]], a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] device, and fore and aft viewscreens. The player fights a variety of enemy units including planes, tanks, bunkers and [[Radio masts and towers|communication towers]].

The vantage point for the game is the [[cockpit]] of the Arcticfox tank. The player can see out of the main viewscreen as well as the tank's sundry features such as the radar screen. The view also shows the character's hand on the [[joystick]] which moves in accordance with the tank's movements. Enemy targets are visible on the view screens and on radar.
