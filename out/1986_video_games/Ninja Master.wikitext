The player controls a ninja who must pass 4 different skill tests that repeat periodically. A minimum score must be achieved to pass the test and move on to the next, otherwise the game ends; the player has three attempts at each test. 

In the first test, the ninja is standing in the center of the screen and arrows are shot at him from four possible directions and at various speeds. The arrows must be shot on the fly with an arm or a leg. The second test takes place in an arena with an audience and advertising banners. The player has to smash a board with a karate chop; the test is to accumulate enough force by quickly waving the controls. The third test is similar to the first one, and the player must intercept incoming [[shurikens|shuriken]] with their sword at three possible heights. In the last test, the player has to use a blowgun to hit canisters that are thrown horizontally at the top of the screen.

After passing all the tests, the player receives a belt and starts over at a higher difficulty level.

Avoid".<ref name=su1 /> Ken McMahon, reviewer for the ''[[Commodore User]]'' magazine, disliked the game so much that he gave it the unusual 0/10 rating.<ref name="commodoreuser"/> The game was rated not much better by ''[[Zzap!64]]'', where reviewers summed it up as "cheap and nasty" and gave it an overall 28% rating.<ref name="zzap"/> ''[[Your Commodore]]'' reviewer found that "the game has no lasting appeal, and even at the budget price, cannot be recommended".<ref name="yourcommodore"/>
