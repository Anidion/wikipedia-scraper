{{nihongo foot|'''''Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo'''''|スーパーゼビウス ガンプの謎|Sūpā Zebiusu Ganpu no Nazo|Super Xevious: The Mystery of GAMP|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1986 vertically [[scrolling shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Namco]] for the [[Family Computer]] in Japan. It is the sequel to ''[[Xevious]]'', a popular arcade game released in late 1982, and the fourth installment in the ''[[List of Xevious media|Xevious]]'' franchise overall. The player controls a spaceship named the Solvalou in its mission to destroy a powerful [[supercomputer]] named GAMP, which took over Earth during an [[ice age]]. ''GAMP no Nazo'' features a heavy focus on puzzle-solving, with each of the game's 21 levels posing a puzzle that must be solved to progress.

Created in response to the overwhelming success of the Family Computer port of ''Xevious'', ''GAMP no Nazo'' was not designed by [[Masanobu Endo]], the creator of the original game. Endo, who left Namco in 1985 to form [[Game Studio (company)|Game Studio]], opposed the idea of a sequel to his creation, as he felt it was unnecessary. Though they share a similar title and gameplay, ''GAMP no Nazo'' is not the same as the arcade game ''[[Super Xevious]]''.

''GAMP no Nazo'' was a [[commercial failure]], and its changes to the gameplay of the original received backlash from fans. Critics disliked the difficulty level for being too high and its usage of secrets for being poorly-implemented and overly-complex. This led to a rethinking of the series' direction, with future ''Xevious'' sequels omitting many of ''GAMP no Nazo''{{'}}s design choices. The game was re-released for the [[Nintendo VS. System]] arcade game hardware in 1987, and through the ''[[Namco Museum Archives Vol. 2]]'' collection in 2020.

''Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo'' is a [[shoot'em up|vertical-scrolling shooter]] video game, and the sequel to ''[[Xevious]]''. The plot involves a [[supercomputer]], General Artificial Matrix Producer (GAMP), taking control of Earth after an [[ice age]] freezes the planet and its population. The player's ship, the Solvalou, is deployed to destroy GAMP and the Xevious forces.<ref name="Manual">{{cite book |title=Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo instruction manual |date=19 September 1986 |publisher=[[Namco]] |url=http://www.videogameden.com/fc/extra/sxe.pdf |access-date=12 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105222327/http://www.videogameden.com/fc/extra/sxe.pdf |archive-date=5 January 2017 |language=Japanese}}</ref> The game contains 21 levels, referred to as "areas" in-game. Levels scroll automatically as the player is given a free range of movement. Each level has a puzzle that must be solved in order to progress. Puzzles include destroying a certain type of enemy and flying into a specified portion of the screen. If the player fails to complete the puzzle, they are sent back to the beginning of the level.<ref name="HG101"/>

The Solvalou begins the game with two weapons: a forward-moving projectile that is used to destroy air-based enemies, and an air-to-ground bomb to destroy ground-stationed enemies.<ref name="HG101"/> A reticle is displayed above the Solvalou that marks where its bombs will land. The Solvalou is able to collect power-up items, indicated by specifically-colored orbs, by rescuing a ship named the Phantom in the second level.<ref name="HG101"/> Black orbs give the Solvalou a shield that protects it from enemy fire; yellow orbs increase the size of the bomb receptacle and blast radius; and blue orbs allow the Solvalou to shoot forwards and backwards.<ref name="HG101"/> The Solvalou can also find a special item called the Super Zapper later in the game. The Super Zapper allows the player to destroy enemies known as Bacura, flying metal boards that were previously indestructible in the original game.<ref name="HG101"/>

''Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo'' was designed by [[Namco]] as a sequel to the original ''[[Xevious]]''.

In 1987, ''GAMP no Nazo'' was released in arcades for the [[Nintendo VS. System]], where it was renamed ''VS. Super Xevious''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vs.

A board game based on ''GAMP no Nazo'' was published the same year, where the objective is to get to the end of the board without getting hit by enemies or losing a "Solvalou marker".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ylärakkola |first1=Arttu |title=Super Xevious Board Game |url=https://solvalou.com/boardgames/xevious |website=Solvalou.com |access-date=12 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421054828/https://solvalou.com/boardgames/xevious |archive-date=21 April 2019}}</ref> ''GAMP no Nazo'' is included in ''[[Namco Museum Archives Vol. 2]]'', a collection of Namco-published Nintendo Entertainment System games released on June 18, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moyse |first1=Chris |title=Namco Museum Archives Vol. 1 & 2 coming to PC and consoles next week |url=https://www.destructoid.com/stories/namco-museum-archives-vol-1-2-coming-to-pc-and-consoles-next-week-593853.phtml |website=[[Destructoid]] |publisher=[[Enthusiast Gaming]] |access-date=12 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612153300/https://www.destructoid.com/stories/namco-museum-archives-vol-1-2-coming-to-pc-and-consoles-next-week-593853.phtml |archive-date=12 June 2020 |date=11 June 2020}}</ref>

''Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo'' was a commercial failure, and struggled to gain sales. Because of its changes to the gameplay of its predecessor, it has since gained a negative reputation from fans, who believe it discards what they felt made the original ''Xevious'' so great.<ref name="Yuge"/> Its failure has been attributed to the release of games such as ''[[Gradius]]'', which raised the bar for what the genre should be like.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Savorelli |first1=Carlo |title=Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/super-xevious-gamp-no-nazo/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=10 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026112724/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/super-xevious-gamp-no-nazo/ |archive-date=26 October 2019 |date=10 December 2013}}</ref>

The game received mixed reviews. The staff at ''Family Computer Magazine'' felt indifferent towards the game's usage of puzzle-solving, believing it would surely be a "controversial" change with ''Xevious'' fans. Staff argued that the puzzle element was poorly-implemented and that the game should have been more straightforward like its predecessor. At the same time, they welcomed the addition of power-up items and new level themes. Overall, they believed it was an average shooter with ill-considered game mechanics.<ref name="FCM"/> In their 1991 [[Mook (publishing)|mook]], they noted that readers were rather critical of the game for its sound, graphics, and for being largely inferior to the original game.<ref name="FCM"/>

Retrospective feedback has been equally mixed. In 2003, the author of book ''Yuge'' briefly commented on it in a retrospective on the Family Computer itself.<ref name="Yuge"/> While the author believes that the game isn't nearly as good as the original, adding that it was a disappointing release at the time, ''GAMP no Nazo'' wasn't as bad as its players made it out to be, writing that the puzzle-solving mechanic made it stand out from other, similar vertical shooters from the era.<ref name="Yuge"/> ''[[Retro Gamer]]''{{'}}s Stuart Campbell, who covered it in a 2007 retrospective on the ''[[List of Xevious media|Xevious]]'' franchise, noted of the game's drastic changes in pace from its predecessor.<ref name="RGamer"/> While Campbell liked the new level themes and expansion on the core gameplay, he was critical of its overly-high difficulty and complicated mechanics. Campbell wrote: "It's a bizarre game, complicated and confusing and mercilessly hard even before it starts pulling mean tricks like hiding enemy fighters underneath clouds. With no continues you'll need an awful lot of persistence if you're ever gonna solve the riddle of what the heck's going on in ''GAMP No Nazo''".<ref name="RGamer"/> In 2014, Carlo Savorelli of ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' enjoyed the game's power-up system and cinematic approach, particularly the tunnel level where the player flies slightly above the ground and has to avoid enemies.<ref name="HG101"/>

==Legacy==
The commercial and critical failure of ''Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo'' prompted Namco to rethink the direction that the ''Xevious'' series was taking. Future sequels to the original, such as ''[[Xevious: Fardraut Saga]]'' (1988) and ''[[Xevious 3D/G]]'' (1996), ignored many concepts established in ''GAMP no Nazo'' and chose to stick to the formula established in the first game.<ref name="RGamer"/> ''GAMP no Nazo'' was the first ''Xevious'' title to have GAMP as a character in-game, as previously he had only appeared by name in promotional material; GAMP has appeared in most ''Xevious'' sequels since.

The game appears as the name of a fictional sponsor in the 2004 [[PlayStation Portable]] game ''[[Ridge Racer (2004 video game)|Ridge Racers]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tojo |first1=Daniel |last2=Otero |first2=Cesar |title=Ridge Racer: Dos Décadas a Todo Gas |url=https://as.com/meristation/2013/10/12/reportajes/1381557600_123542.html |website=MeriStation |access-date=13 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107072909/https://as.com/meristation/2013/10/12/reportajes/1381557600_123542.html |archive-date=7 January 2019 |language=Spanish |date=12 October 2013}}</ref> A battery charger designed after the cover art for the game was released in Japan in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nagaoka |first1=Yori |title=ファミコンソフトそっくりの充電器「BGAME」に「スーパーゼビウス ガンプの謎」が登場 |url=https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1186012.html |website=Game Watch |publisher=Impress Group |access-date=12 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527010129/https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1186012.html |archive-date=27 May 2019 |language=Japanese |date=23 May 2019}}</ref> In 2016, Japanese company Dream Factory published ''Xevious: GAMP no Nazo wa Subete Hodoketa!?'' for [[iOS]] devices.
