'''''Knightmare'''''{{efn|Known as {{nihongo|'''''Majou Densetsu'''''|魔城伝説|''Majō Densetsu''|lit. "Demon Castle Legend" or "Legend of the Devil Castle"|lead=yes}} in Japan.}} is a 1986 [[vertically scrolling shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Konami]] for the [[MSX]] home computer. It was included in compilations for the MSX, [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]], followed by a port for [[mobile phone]]s, and digital re-releases for the [[Virtual Console]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is the first entry in the ''Knightmare'' trilogy. The game stars Popolon, a warrior who embarks on a quest to rescue the princess Aphrodite from the evil priest Hudnos. The player must fight waves of enemies while avoiding collision with their projectiles and obstacles along the way, and facing against bosses.

''Knightmare'' was created by the MSX division at Konami under management of Shigeru Fukutake. The character of Popolon was conceived by a staffer who later became the project's lead designer and writer, as the process of making original titles for the platform revolved around the person who came up with the characters. Development proceeded with a team of four or five members, lasting somewhere between four and six months. The music was scored by [[Miki Higashino]], best known for her work in the ''[[Gradius]]'' and ''[[Suikoden]]'' series, and Yoshinori Sasaki. 

''Knightmare'' garnered generally positive reception from critics and retrospective commentarists. It was followed by ''[[The Maze of Galious]]'' and ''[[Shalom: Knightmare III]]'' (1987), while Popolon and Aphrodite would later make appearances outside of the trilogy in other Konami titles. In the years since, fans have experimented with remaking and porting the title unofficially to other platforms.

''Knightmare'' is a vertical-scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] game starring Popolon, a warrior who embarks on a quest to rescue the princess Aphrodite from the evil priest Hudnos. The player controls Popolon through eight increasingly difficult stages across a Greek-esque fantasy setting, populated with an assortment of enemies and obstacles, over a constantly scrolling background that never stops moving until a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] is reached, which must be fought in order to progress further.<ref name="KMJhg101"/><ref name="KMDhtpJP">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Knightmare1986KonamiJPRC739|title=魔城伝説|date=March 1986|publisher=[[Konami]]|edition=Japanese|type=遊び方}}</ref><ref name="KMDhtpEU">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Knightmare1986KonamiGBFR/mode/2up|title=Knightmare|date=1986|publisher=[[Konami]]|edition=European|type=How To Play}}</ref><ref name="LOGiNv5i5">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/login-may-1986/LOGiN%20-%20May%201986/page/n223/mode/2up|title=月刊MSXジャン — 魔城伝説|magazine=[[LOGiN Magazine|LOGiN]]|volume=5|issue=5|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation]]|date=May 1986|pages=222—224|language=ja}}</ref><ref name="POPCOMv4i7">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/popcom-198607/page/n79/mode/2up|title=Monthly Soft Radar: 魔城伝説|magazine={{ill|Popcom (magazine)|lt=Popcom|ja|ポプコム}}|volume=4|issue=7|publisher=[[Shogakukan]]|date=July 1986|pages=80—81|language=ja}}</ref> The player must also avoid or take out enemy formations to gain bonus points, and reveal hidden bridges to cross rivers by shooting at it.<ref name="KMDhtpJP"/><ref name="KMDhtpEU"/>

Popolon is equipped with a bow and arrows as the main weapon, which can be upgraded or changed by collecting a flashing weapon crystal.

== Development and release ==
''Knightmare'', known as ''Majou Densetsu'' in Japan, was developed by the [[MSX]] division at [[Konami]] under management of Shigeru Fukutake, who revealed about its creation process in a 1988 interview with Japanese publication ''Micom BASIC Magazine''.<ref name="MBM75">{{cite magazine|last=Yamashita|first=Akira|url=https://archive.org/details/micomBASIC_1988-09/page/n251/mode/2up|title=山下章のパソコン・ゲーム: ホンキでPlayホンネでReview — TARGET 5 コナミMSXゲーム|magazine={{ill|Micom BASIC Magazine|lt=Micom BASIC Magazine|ja|マイコンBASICマガジン}}|issue=75|publisher={{ill|The Dempa Shimbunsha Corporation|lt=The Dempa Shimbunsha Corporation|ja|電波新聞社}}|date=September 1988|pages=278–282|lang=ja}} ([https://thearkhound.tumblr.com/post/187958078198/exploring-the-secret-behind-konamis-msx-games Translation] by Arc Hound. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925132527/https://thearkhound.tumblr.com/post/187958078198/exploring-the-secret-behind-konamis-msx-games|date=2021-09-25}}).</ref> Fukutate explained that the staffer who came up with the character of Popolon was in charge of design and facilitating development of the project, as the process of making original titles for the MSX revolved around the person who came up with the characters being assigned to do both planning and the story.<ref name="MBM75"/> Fukutate further explained that the planner would then lead a team of four or five members to proceed with development, which would last between four and six months.<ref name="MBM75"/> Fukutate also claimed they made it difficult from the beginning because shoot 'em ups on the MSX were meant to be played at home.<ref name="MBM75"/> ''Micom BASIC'' writer Akira Yamashita speculated that the game's idea was possibly an arrangement of the Konami [[arcade game]] ''[[Finalizer (video game)|Finalizer]]'' (1985).<ref name="MBM75"/> The soundtrack was composed by [[Miki Higashino]] (best known for her work in the ''[[Gradius]]'' and ''[[Suikoden]]'' series) and Yoshinori Sasaki.<ref name="OMF">{{cite web|last=Mitsuda|first=Yasunori|author-link=Yasunori Mitsuda|url=http://mitsuda.cocoebiz.com/friends/higashino.html|title=This Month's Friend...
