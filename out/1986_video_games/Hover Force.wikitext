'''''Hover Force''''' is a [[video game]] published by INTV Corporation for the [[Intellivision]] [[gaming console|video game system]] in 1986.<ref name="GameFAQs">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/intellivision/576732-hover-force/data|title=Hover force Release Information for Intellivision|work=GameFAQs.com|accessdate=2010-07-09}}</ref> The game was initially developed by [[Mattel|Mattel Electronics]] with the intent of it being played in [[3D computer graphics|3-D]], but the company was shut down before it could be released; INTV, after acquiring the Intellivision assets from Mattel, re-tooled the game, which pits players against a terrorist group laying siege to a city, and released it itself.

==Gameplay==
In ''Hover Force'', the player is a pilot of a combat [[helicopter]]. Terrorists are attacking the fictional city of New Seeburg,<ref name="HFinst">{{Cite web|url=http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/instructions/intv/hover.txt|title=Hover Force Instructions|work=IntellivisionLives.com|accessdate=2010-07-09}}</ref> and the player must eliminate the terrorists and also minimize the amount of damage the terrorists are causing. The helicopter is armed with laser cannons and water cannons, both with a limited amount of ammunition. The water cannons are used to put out fires started by the terrorists' activities.

Players seek out enemy helicopters with a radar screen, then fly using a [[top-down perspective]] toward their targets. The terrorists attack with a number of different helicopters, each with different skills and patterns. Attacks on the player's helicopter may cause damage to certain systems, such as weapons or the engine. Depending on the system, the damage can either make operating the craft difficult or cause the helicopter to crash, ending the game.<ref name="HFinst"/>

The player's missions start and end at an island base near the city. This base will also repair, refuel and re-arm the helicopter during the missions, but only twice; a third attempt to land prior to completion of the mission counts as a crash.<ref name="HFinst"/> Upon completion of the game, the player is given a rank between 1 and 100 based on their efficiency at both eliminating enemy helicopters and keeping damage to a minimum, with a score of 100 considered "perfect."<ref name="HFinst"/>

==Development==
In the early 1980s, researchers at the [[University of Georgia]] developed a technology for viewing [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] images using glasses fitted with special [[Prism (optics)|prism]]s, and attempted to solicit interest from various video game companies.<ref name="INTVlives"/> Mattel Electronics began pursuing the technology, with ''Hover Force'', then marketed as ''Hover Force 3-D'', making its debut at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in January 1984.<ref name="INTVlives"/> Mattel Electronics had developed a method for producing the glasses at low cost, and had even decided to develop two additional 3-D titles, but the company was shut down before the plans could come to fruition.<ref name="INTVlives"/> INTV Corporation, which acquired Intellivision's assets from Mattel, re-tooled the game and dropped any mention of 3-D for its release in 1986.<ref name="INTVlives"/>

The technology was later used by Crayola for their 3D Chalk toy and these glasses can be used to experience the 3D effects in this Intellivision game.<ref name="ArmchairArc">{{Cite web|url=http://www.armchairarcade.com/neo/node/4852|title=Hover Force in 3D for the Intellivision using $5 glasses!

==Legacy==
''Hover Force'' was re-released as part of the ''[[Intellivision Lives!]]'' collection.<ref name="INTVlives"/> In July 2010, [[Microsoft]] re-released ''Hover Force'' on the [[Game Room]] service for its [[Xbox 360]] console and for [[Games for Windows Live]].
