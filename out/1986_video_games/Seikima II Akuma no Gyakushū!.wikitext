{{nihongo|'''''Seikima II Akuma no Gyakushū!'''''|聖飢魔II 悪魔の逆襲！||lit. "Seikima II The Wrath of Satan!"}} is a video game that was released in Japan in 1986.

In 1987, the game was re-released for the [[MSX]]2 under the title {{nihongo|'''''Seikima II Special'''''|聖飢魔IIスペシャル}}<ref name="special">[http://www.gamefaqs.com/msx/918189-seikima-ii-special/data ''Seikima II Special''] at [[GameFAQs]]</ref> with more detailed sprites and backgrounds. It also featured actual Seikima-II music.

==Summary==
The game is based on a then-popular Japanese [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed by Damian Hamada called ''[[Seikima-II]]''. This band lasted from its creation in 1982 to its dissolution on December 31, 1999. Their history, as it has been prophesied, is that they are a group of [[demons]] preaching a [[religion]] in order to propagate [[Satan]] through the use of Heavy Metal. Each member is a demon of a different hierarchical class with His Excellency Demon Kogure being [[leader]] of demons and His Majesty Damian Hamada being [[crown prince]] of hell. In accordance to the prophecy and after completing the [[World government|world conquest]], the band would disband at the end of the century on December 12, 1999 at 23:59:59 [[Japan Standard Time]] (09:59:99 [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]]).
