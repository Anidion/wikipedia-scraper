''BMX Simulator'' is an overhead race game similar to the arcade video game ''[[Super Sprint]]''. The player must race against another player, or the computer, around a series of seven different [[bicycle motocross]] (BMX) tracks. There is also a time limit to be beaten. Only two cyclists can compete in each race. The race can be viewed in [[slow-motion]] [[instant replay]] afterward.
