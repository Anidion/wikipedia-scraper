{{nihongo|'''''Nobunaga's Ambition'''''|信長の野望・全国版|Nobunaga no Yabō: Zenkokuban}} is a 1986 [[strategy game]] by [[Koei]], focused in the Sengoku period of the history of Japan. A part of Koei's "Historical Simulation" line of titles, it was published on several platforms such as [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[Amiga]], the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Super NES]], and [[Sega Genesis|Mega-Drive]]. It is the second game in the ''[[Nobunaga's Ambition]]'' series and the first ''Nobunaga's Ambition'' title to be released in English. The player has the objective unifying Japan as [[Oda Nobunaga]] or as any of the other daimyos present in the game. Several revisions were made to the gameplay since the first game, as well as a 50-province mode which expanded the game's map to feature all of Japan.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Nobunaga's_Ambition_MS-DOS_screenshot.png|thumb|left|MS-DOS screenshot]]
The player may choose from four campaign scenarios, including "Battle for the East" (beginning in 1560), "Daimyo Power Struggles" (1560), "Ambition Untamed" (1571), and "Road Towards Unification" (1582). In each scenario, the player must allocate resources to raise a capable military force, provide a productive economy to support both military and civilian expansion, and support the [[peasant]]s in order to sustain their respect and loyalty. Gameplay is taken in turns, with each turn in the map view corresponding to a season, and each turn during battle corresponding to a day. The player may achieve victory through numerous means, among which are forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying the enemy command unit, outlasting an invading force, or prolonging battles until the opposing force has exhausted its supplies.

The player can make many choices during the campaign, such as, according to Evan Brooks of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'': "One may transfer soldiers between fiefs, go to war, increase taxes (which causes a decrease in peasant loyalty which may lead to rebellion), transfer rice or gold to another fief, raise the level of flood control (which decreases productivity), make a non-aggression pact or arrange a marriage, cultivate (which increases productivity, but decreases peasant loyalty), use a merchant (to buy/sell rice, borrow funds, or purchase weapons), recruit for the military (soldiers or ninja), train the army (which increases fighting efficiency), spy on a rival, expand a town (which increases taxes collected, but decreases peasant loyalty), give food/rice to peasants/soldiers (to raise morale), steal peasants from rival daimyos, allocate military strength, recuperate (even a daimyo can get sick), turn over a controlled fief to the computer for administration, or pass a turn (hint: when one has no idea of what to do, train the troops.)"<ref name=CGWpolitics>{{cite magazine|title =The Politics of War |date =September 1988 |url =https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_51/page/n33/mode/2up |magazine =[[Computer Gaming World]] |publisher =Golden Empire Publications|author=M.

== Reception ==
In [[North America]], the game was positively reviewed by ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', where reviewer Evan Brooks gave it four stars out of five. He introduced the game as "a detailed economic / diplomatic / political / military simulation of the unification of Japan in the Sixteenth Century." He praised the graphics for being "among the best that this reviewer has ever seen for the IBM" and the 5x10 [[hex map]] battles, and noted that it used [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] elements, including assigning various [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] to a selected persona, a [[Persistent world|time system]] where each turn represents a year, as the daimyo ages and eventually dies of old age, and a [[multiplayer]] option. He stated that he "thoroughly enjoyed ''Nobunaga's Ambition''", concluded with a "Highly Recommended" rating,<ref name=CGWpolitics /><ref>{{cite magazine|title =Computer Strategy and Wargames: Pre-20th Century|date =October 1990 |url =https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_75/page/n11/mode/2up |magazine =[[Computer Gaming World]] |publisher =Golden Empire Publications |author=M.

Publications |last =Randall |first =Neil |issue =104 |pages =90, 94 |issn=0194-357X}}</ref> In the May 1990 edition of ''[[Games International]]'', Brian Walker called this program "one of the best strategy games around." He gave the game a perfect rating of 10 out of 10 for game play.<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine|last=Walker|first=Brian| date=May 1990 |title=Nobunaga's Ambition|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=14|page=49 |url =https://archive.org/details/GamesInternational/GI_14_May_1990/page/n47/mode/2up}}</ref>

The console versions had a more lukewarm reception. Reviewing the SNES version, ''[[GamePro]]'' praised the control interface and combat system but opined that the game essentially offers nothing to set it apart from Koei's previous historical simulators.<ref name=gameproSNES>{{cite magazine|title =Role-Player's Realm: Nobunaga's Ambition|date =May 1994 |url =https://archive.org/details/GamePro_Issue_058_May_1994/page/n119/mode/2up |magazine =[[GamePro]] |publisher =[[International Data Group|IDG Communications]] |author=Bro' Buzz|issue =5|volume=6 |page =118|issn=1042-8658}}</ref> They rated the Genesis version similarly, saying that "Like all Koei games, Nobunaga has an easy-to-use but detailed menu-driven interface that activates a load of complex commands."<ref name=gameproGENESIS>{{cite magazine|title =Role-Player's Realm: Nobunaga's Ambition |date =July 1994 |magazine =[[GamePro]] |publisher =[[International Data Group|IDG Communications]] |author=Bro' Buzz|issue =7|volume=6 |page =126 |issn=1042-8658}}</ref>
