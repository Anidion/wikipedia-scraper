{{nihongo|'''''Penguin Adventure'''''|夢大陸アドベンチャー|Yume Tairiku Adobenchā|lit. "Dream Continent Adventure"}} is a [[Racing game|racing]] [[platform game]] released by [[Konami]] in 1986, and a sequel to 1983's ''[[Antarctic Adventure]]''. The game marks the professional debut of game designer [[Hideo Kojima]], who participated in the planning.<ref>[http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1229899_1124.html KONAMIのMSX往年の名作がWiiバーチャルコンソールに登場] ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1229899_1124.html&ei=Vl07TZD-DNyShAemvaCOCg&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDwQ7gEwAw&prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522%25E5%25A4%25A2%25E5%25A4%25A7%25E9%2599%25B8%25E3%2582%25A2%25E3%2583%2589%25E3%2583%2599%25E3%2583%25B3%25E3%2583%2581%25E3%2583%25A3%25E3%2583%25BC%2522%2Bsite:famitsu.com%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DUym%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26prmd%3Divns Translation]), [[Famitsu]]</ref>

The story follows Penta, a [[penguin]] who has to bring home a golden apple in order to cure Penguette, the Penguin Princess.

==Gameplay==
This title significantly expanded upon the gameplay of ''Antarctic Adventure'' by most notably adding a greater variety of stages and enemies and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements: [[Boss (video games)|boss fights]], purchasable items, and several [[minigame]]s. Items can be purchased through three different fisherman, in exchange for fish, that give Penta new abilities. One of the items that can be bought is a gun.

Level design and variety have increased from ''Antarctic Adventure''; there are forest levels, ice levels, water-based levels, caves, and even some outer-space bonus levels.<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/penguin-adventure|name=Penguin Adventure}}</ref> There are several shortcuts, usually hidden underneath holes (which are typically harmful hazards) in the game, that allow the player to go on almost completely different paths. The game features [[Types of fiction with multiple endings|multiple endings]], with the hidden good ending available when the player pauses the game a certain number of times.<ref>[http://uk.gamespot.com/msx/action/penguinadventure/hints.html Penguin Adventure] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120716002400/http://uk.gamespot.com/msx/action/penguinadventure/hints.html |date=2012-07-16}}, [[GameSpot]]</ref> In the bad ending, the princess dies, while in the good ending, she lives.

Some publications have stated that Kojima reused the idea for multiple endings from this game in ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'' and, to an extent, ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'', due to it often being cited as his debut game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Todd|first=Ciolek|title=Less than Famous Firsts: Your Favorite Developers' Early Efforts|url=http://bestof2004.1up.com/features/less-than-famous-firsts|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=1 June 2012|date=October 12, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701172713/http://bestof2004.1up.com/features/less-than-famous-firsts|archive-date=2012-07-01}}</ref> However, Kojima himself has stated that he only participated in the project for about a month to help plan the game, pitching suggestions such as the slot machine in the shop and how to defeat the bosses.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kojima |first1=Hideo |script-title=ja:最初の仕事です。企画のサポートでアイデア出しを一ヶ月くらいしました。地下のスロットマシンやボス敵の倒し方等は僕のアイデアです。それが認められて？自分の企画を一本任されました。RT @snakesize: 監督は本当に「けっきょく南極大冒険」の制作に携わられてたのですか？ |url=https://twitter.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/10822618937|website=Twitter |date=Mar 21, 2010 |language=ja |access-date=5 September 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kojima |first1=Hideo |script-title=ja:そっちです。RT @hatimaki_create: @Kojima_Hideo あれ？「夢大陸アドベンチャー」の方ではなかったでしたっけ？ |url=https://twitter.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/10822886295|website=Twitter |date=Mar 21, 2010 |language=ja |access-date=5 September 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kojima |first1=Hideo |script-title=ja:『夢大陸アドベンチャー（MSX）』は僕の監督デビュー作ではないです。入社したての86年に上長から企画サポート（アイデア出し）を頼まれて、一時期だけ参加しました。幾つかのボス戦やギミック等は僕のアイデアが採用されてますが、企画/ゲームデザインは別の方です。誤解をされている様なのでｗ |url=https://twitter.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/427981886875377665|website=Twitter |date=Jan 27, 2014 |language=ja |access-date=5 September 2023}}</ref> Additionally, his name does not appear in the credits either. Kojima's first game credit and directorial debut would be with ''[[Metal Gear (video game)|Metal Gear]]'', released for the [[MSX2]] the next year.
