{{nihongo|'''''World Grand Prix'''''|ザ・サーキット||"The Circuit"}} is a [[racing video game]] released by [[Sega]] for the [[Master System]] in 1986. The player drives a [[Formula One]] style car as quickly as possible while navigating through turns and other vehicles on the road. A formal scoring system is not used; players are not ranked by position unlike most racing games. This kind of timekeeping would not be used in a subsequent video game until the release of the ''Taito Grand Prix: Eikō e no License'' on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] the following year.

==Reception==
''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine rated the game 81% in 1989.<ref name="CVG">{{cite journal |title=Complete Games Guide |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref>
