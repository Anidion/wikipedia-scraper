==Plot==
Jack, the [[protagonist]] of the game, must make his way through 16 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] set within a [[pyramid]] in order to defeat the demon Belzebut and rescue the royal Pamera family.<ref name="VGEden" /><ref name="Summary">{{cite web | title=Mighty Bomb Jack Game Summary | url=http://nintendoenthusiast.com/n/game/mighty-bomb-jack | website=Nintendo Enthusiast | accessdate=2014-12-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217180908/http://nintendoenthusiast.com/n/game/mighty-bomb-jack | archive-date=2014-12-17 | url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Mighty Bomb Jack 1.png|thumb|left|An action zone (NES version). The blue character in the center is Jack, the [[player character]].]]

Each level is split into two parts; an action zone and a Royal [[Palace]] room. The mechanics and level [[video game design|designs]] of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from ''Bomb Jack''. Action zones can be split up into several portions and contain [[power-ups]] usually hidden in [[treasure]] [[Chest (furniture)|chests]] such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors; blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the game's timer. [[Secret passage]]s can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a [[Sphinx]] in a visible or hidden treasure chest.<ref name="VGEden" /><ref name="Summary" />

To prevent the player from becoming too "greedy", the game automatically sends the player to a Torture Room if they obtain more than 9 Mighty Coins or 99 seconds on the game's timer. The only way to escape a Torture Room without losing a life is to complete a number of jumps, which are counted down on the screen. Once the player exits the Torture Room, Jack automatically loses all Mighty Coins, the timer is reset to 60 seconds, and the game recommences from the beginning of the current level.<ref name="VGEden" /><ref name="Summary" />

==VS. System version==
A [[Nintendo VS. System]] version of the game was released in 1986 for the Japanese market (not to be confused with the original dedicated arcade version). Differences between the original and VS. versions include adding a [[multiplayer|two-player]] mode, changing the locations of some secret passages and removing a [[Warp (gaming)|warp]] in the Royal Palace rooms.<ref name="VGEden" />

In Japan, the game sold over 1.5 million copies by 1987. In North America, the game received a positive review from ''[[Computer Entertainer]]'' upon release, with a score of 7.5 out of 8 stars, the same as ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' in the same issue. They called ''Mighty Bomb Jack'' a fast-paced "adventure-action game" that is "loaded with nuances which you will continue to discover as play" and said it is a tough, frustrating, "just one more time" game that "will have you back for more and more!"<ref name="CE"/>

The Virtual Console re-releases later received mixed-to-negative reviews, with [[GameSpot]] calling the game "repetitive" and "broken",<ref name="GameSpot">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/mighty-bomb-jack-1987/reviews/mighty-bomb-jack-review-6171111/|website=[[GameSpot]]|title=Mighty Bomb Jack Review|last=Provo|first=Frank|date=2007-05-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413070013/http://www.gamespot.com/mighty-bomb-jack-1987/reviews/mighty-bomb-jack-review-6171111/|archive-date=2013-04-13}}</ref> while ''[[Eurogamer]]'' called it "[kind of] clever", though "not exactly deep".<ref name="Eurogamer">{{cite web | title=Virtual Console Roundup | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/vcroundup_150607?page=2 | author= Whitehead, Dan | date=2007-06-15 | website=[[Eurogamer]] | page=2 | accessdate=2014-12-17}}</ref> [[IGN]] called the Wii Virtual Console version of ''Mighty Bomb Jack'' "a poor candidate for your time investment".<ref name="IGN">{{cite web | title=Mighty Bomb Jack Review | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/07/mighty-bomb-jack-review | author= Thomas, Lucas M. | date=2007-05-07 | website=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2014-12-17}}</ref>

''[[Nintendo Life]]'' criticized the game's platforming and level design, stating that "dynamics of [the game] are somewhat broken" and that "the key to success is anticipating how [enemies] will move in order to get past", because their behavior is "almost random". On the other hand, Nintendo Life praised ''Mighty Bomb Jack''{{'}}s secrets for adding some [[replay value]], as well as the game's sense of humor.<ref name="Nintendo Life">{{cite web | title=Review | url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/vc/mighty_bomb_jack_nes | author= Calvert, Darren | date=2007-04-24 | website=[[Nintendo Life]] | accessdate=2014-12-17}}</ref>
