'''''Shanghai''''' is a computerized version of [[mahjong solitaire]] published by [[Activision]] in 1986 for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], [[classic Mac OS]], [[Apple IIGS]], and [[Master System]]. ''Shanghai'' was originally programmed by Brodie Lockard.<ref name="Dragon138"/> It was released as an [[arcade video game]] by [[Sunsoft]] in 1988.

==Gameplay== 
The game uses a full set of 144 mahjong tiles, divided as follows:

* Dots (1 through 9)
* Bamboos (1 through 9)
* Characters (1 through 9)
* Winds (north, east, south, west)
* Dragons (red, green, white)
* Seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter)
* Flowers (bamboo, plum, orchid, chrysanthemum)

There are four of every tile except for the seasons and flowers, which have only one tile each.

The object of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board by matching pairs, but only tiles with at least one free vertical edge may be matched on a turn. Any two seasons can form a pair, as can any two flowers. The game ends if no legal moves can be made.

After winning a game, a portion of the screen collapses to reveal a dragon blinking an eye.<ref name="Dragon138"/> The Macintosh and Master System versions show an animated dragon spitting fire.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
