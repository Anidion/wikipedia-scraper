The game is a [[turn-based strategy]] focuses on the invasion and land battles of [[Iwo Jima]]. The player commands the [[United States Marine Corps]] against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], who are occupying the islands as part of the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II]]. The game is menu-based and only allows the player to use four command functions; move, attack, land and pass.<ref name=crash/> Depending on the difficulty set, the game lasts 32 to 36 turns and can only be won by eliminating all Japanese forces from the island before the final turn ends.<ref name=crash/><ref name=CVG/> During the game, the enemy may fortify their positions, launch air strikes against the [[United States Navy]] fleet or may perform suicide attacks if their unit is about to be wiped out. The player also has the ability to order air strikes against the enemy, if weather permits.<ref name=crash/>

At the beginning of the game, the player has to allocate a number of American troops in order to establish a [[beachhead]] on one of the six beaches of the island. However, many of the beaches are scattered with [[land mine]]s and may provide an initial disadvantage to the assault.<ref name=crash/> Throughout the game, the player may call in air strikes and other assaults, however they are only available after the American forces are attacked or if the enemy retreats to an inaccessible location.<ref name=crash/> At any time in the game, the player is also able to request troop reinforcements from the fleet.<ref name=crash/><ref name=CU/> Furthermore, Japanese air forces may sink American battleships throughout the game, although the player will be given the opportunity to shoot them down.<ref name=SU/> In addition, a Japanese submarine will sink American [[gunboat]]s at random intervals, and cannot be destroyed in any way.<ref name=crash/><ref name=CU/> There is no save function in the game.<ref name=CVG/>

The game received mixed reviews from critics upon release. Both Gwyn Hughes of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' and a reviewer of ''ZX Computing'' praised the game's value for money and heralded it as a "good introduction" to the wargaming genre, although Hughes believed that ''Iwo Jima'' was unlikely to provide established tacticians with a "major challenge"<ref name=YS>{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=Gwyn|title=Iwo Jima review|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/iwojima.htm|publisher=Your Sinclair|access-date=22 November 2015|page=33|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306035818/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/iwojima.htm|archive-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> and the reviewer of ''ZX Computing'' was concerned that the game was "too easy".<ref name=ZX>{{cite journal|title=Theatre Europe and Iwo Jima review|journal=ZX Computing|date=August 1986|issue=86|page=43|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/ZXComputing/Issue8608/Pages/ZXComputing860800043.jpg|access-date=23 November 2015}}</ref>  Sean Masterson of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' criticised the graphics, stating that it was "let down by poor unit markers and terrain features".<ref name=crash>{{cite journal|last1=Masterson|first1=Sean|title=Iwo Jima review|journal=Crash|date=July 1986|issue=30|pages=55, 56|url=http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/review.aspx?gid=2775&rid=6173|access-date=22 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123030754/http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/review.aspx?gid=2775&rid=6173|archive-date=23 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Gary Rook of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' asserted that the game was overall "competent", however he summarised it as "failing to excite". Rook also added that the game was well implemented and "inspiring".<ref name=SU>{{cite journal|last1=Rook|first1=Gary|title=Iwo Jima review|journal=Sinclair User|date=September 1986|issue=54|page=47|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/SinclairUser/Issue054/Pages/SinclairUser05400047.jpg|access-date=23 November 2015}}</ref>

A reviewer of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' criticised the game for having an "awkward mechanism" due to the lack of a save feature and neglecting historic realism. However, he compared the historical accuracy of the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] for being more accurate than ''[[Falklands '82]]''{{'}}s interpretation of the [[Falklands War]].<ref name=CVG>{{cite journal|title=Iwo Jima and Theatre Europe review|journal=Computer and Video Games|date=October 1986|issue=42|page=10|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue061/Pages/CVG06100042.jpg|access-date=23 November 2015}}</ref> Mark Reed of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' stated that the game is "ideal" for novice players and also praised the simplicity of the controls, despite suggesting that experienced gamers of the genre would prefer "something more complex".<ref name=CU>{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=Mark|title=Iwo Jima review|journal=Computer Gamer|date=August 1986|issue=17|page=94|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gamer_Issue_17_1986-08_Argus_Press_GB#page/n93/mode/1up|access-date=23 November 2015}}</ref> Masterson similarly criticised the game's suitability for experienced gamers, suggesting that any appeal for a more experienced player is likely to be "very limited".<ref name=crash/>

M. Evan Brooks reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "While Iwo/Falklands may not be to the taste of the experienced wargamer, they may prove just the ticket to gaining another convert to computer conflict simulations."<ref name="CGW34">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M.
