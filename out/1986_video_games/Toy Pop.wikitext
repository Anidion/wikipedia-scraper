''Toy Pop'' is a top-down multi-directional shooter that can be played both single-player or with two players simultaneously. The first player plays as a wooden puppet named Pino, who resembles [[Pinocchio]], and the second player plays as a doll named Acha, who resembles [[Little Red Riding Hood]].<ref name="Allgame"/> The players venture through 44 floors (the game uses the toy-themed term "Box" as opposed to "Floor", to fit with the game's setting) collecting four gold hearts contained in jars on each floor in order to advance. Along the way, the players must open gift-wrapped containers concealing either weapons or score-increasing bonus items; these various weapons are used to defeat several different varieties of enemies (Heitai, Cars, Tanks, Domdoms, Trumps, Osaru, Robots and occasionally the evil wizard Mahou), with many typically vulnerable to only one type of weapon. On the 44th floor, the players battle the evil witch Majyo, who can only be defeated by finding all eight gold hearts scattered around the room.
