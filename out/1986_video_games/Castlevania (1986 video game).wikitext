It was also re-issued for the Family Computer in cartridge format in 1993. It is the first game in Konami's ''[[Castlevania]]'' [[video game series]].

Players control [[Simon Belmont]], descendant of a legendary vampire hunter, who enters the castle of [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Count Dracula]] to destroy him when he suddenly reappears 100 years after Simon's ancestor vanquished him.<ref>{{cite book| title=Akumajō Dracula instruction manual| year=1986| publisher=Konami| language=ja| id=KDS-AKM | pages=6–7}}</ref> ''Castlevania'' was developed in tandem with the [[MSX]]2 game ''[[Vampire Killer]]'', which was released a month later and uses the same characters and setting, but features different gameplay mechanics. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'', and a prequel, ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'', both of which were also released for the NES. ''[[Super Castlevania IV]]'' was released in 1991 for the [[Super NES]] and follows the same story. A remake for the [[Sharp X68000]] [[home computer]] was released in 1993, and was later re-released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] as ''[[Castlevania Chronicles]]'' in 2001.

''Castlevania'' was a financial success and received widespread acclaim. It is considered an NES classic by ''[[PC World]]'',{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}} while ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' and ''[[Game Informer]]'' both ranked it in their lists of the best video games ever made.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

==Gameplay==
[[File:Castlevania nes 03.png|left|thumb|Screenshot of ''Castlevania'' on the NES]]

''Castlevania'' uses [[platform game]]play and is divided into six blocks of three stages each, for a total of 18 stages. Simon can move, jump, crouch, climb stairs and use a magic whip (known in the series as the "Vampire Killer") as his primary combat weapon. When the player presses the button to crack the whip, there is a short delay before Simon actually does so.<ref name="1up.com">{{cite web |title=Tales From The Crypt: Castlevania 20th Anniversary Blowout from 1UP.com |url=http://www.1up.com/features/castlevania-turns-20 |work=[[1UP.com]] |last=Kalata |first=Kurt |date=July 26, 2006 |access-date=December 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205010356/http://www.1up.com/features/castlevania-turns-20 |archive-date=December 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The player begins the game with four lives and five hearts, and must complete the current block of stages before a timer runs out. Simon has a health meter, which decreases whenever he is hit by an enemy or projectile. One life is lost if either the meter or the timer reaches zero, or if Simon falls off the bottom of the screen or is hit by a moving spiked ceiling. Hidden food items restore health, and bonus lives are earned at certain score thresholds. The player fights a boss character, usually themed after a classic horror movie monster such as [[Frankenstein's monster]] or the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], at the end of each block, and must win the battle and pick up a red orb that restores all health before time runs out in order to advance. The ultimate goal is to defeat Count Dracula himself and the Curse of Man at the end of Stage 18, triggering the collapse of Dracula's castle and allowing the player to restart the game at an increased difficulty.

Throughout the game, the player can find and use various backup weapons, including throwing knives, axes, vials of [[holy water]], a magical [[stopwatch|watch]] that can briefly freeze enemies, and sacred [[Christian cross|crosses]] that function as boomerangs. However, only one such weapon can be carried at a time; if the player picks up a new one or loses a life, the weapon is automatically lost. Backup weapons require hearts for their use, which can be found by extinguishing candles or defeating enemies with the whip. Other hidden items include point bonuses (sacks of money), temporary invincibility (golden jar), upgrades to the whip's length and power (metal chain), instant destruction of all on-screen enemies (blue [[rosary]]) and double to triple use of the backup weapon.

When all lives are lost, the player has the option to continue from the start of the block or return to the title screen.

==Development==

''Castlevania'' was directed by Hitoshi Akamatsu. An admirer of cinema, Akamatsu approached projects with a "film director's eye", and said the visuals and music for ''Castlevania'' were "made by people who consciously wanted to do something cinematic."<ref name="AkamatsuDevCommentary">{{Cite web |url=http://shmuplations.com/castlevania/ |title=Castlevania – Developer Commentary |publisher=Shmupulations|access-date=2019-05-10 }}</ref> With ''Castlevania'', he wanted players to feel like they were in a classic horror film.<ref name="MicomInterview">{{cite magazine |date=August 1993 |title=WE ASKED THE DEVELOPERS "What is the charm of Dracula?" |url=https://thearkhound.tumblr.com/post/183537621473/1993-castlevania-commentary-from-micom-basic |magazine=Micom BASIC |access-date=June 24, 2019}}</ref>

It was originally released for the [[Family Computer Disk System]] in 1986. Due to its success in Japan, it was released in cartridge format for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) under the title of ''Castlevania'' in 1987 in North America and 1988 in Europe, and re-released in cartridge format for the Japanese Famicom under its original title in 1993.<ref name="retrogamer"/> The international name of ''Castlevania'' was the result of Konami of America senior vice president Emil Heidkamp's discomfort with the religious connotations of the title ''Akumajō Dracula'', which he believed translated as "Dracula Satanic Castle".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Blake|title=[[Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle that Defined a Generation]]|date=2014|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780062276698|pages=200–201|edition=First}}</ref> ''Castlevania'' was one of the first major platform games on the NES and a part of an unofficial second wave of video games for the NES.<ref>{{cite web |title=Castlevania: The Retrospective |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/19/castlevania-the-retrospective |work=[[IGN]] |last=Bozon |first=Mark |date=January 18, 2007 |access-date=November 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226063057/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/19/castlevania-the-retrospective |archive-date=December 26, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Its release coincided with the 90th anniversary of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=NES Classics |url=http://ms.nintendo-europe.com/nesclassics/enGB/ |work=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of Europe]] |access-date=December 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=June 2022|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The player-character Simon was originally named Peter Dante (a reference to [[Peter Cushing]] and [[Joe Dante]]), a vampire killer who was a grandson of Christopher Dante (a reference to [[Christopher Lee]]). At the time, whip attacks were planned to be in multiple directions, an idea later seen in ''Super Castlevania IV''.<ref name="HistoryOfCV">{{cite book|title=The History of Castlevania: Book of the Crescent Moon|date=May 16, 2019|publisher=Konami|pages=48–49}}</ref> Other sub-weapons were planned, such as garlic, wooden stakes and an item that transforms the player-character into a werewolf, but they were not included in the game.<ref name="HistoryOfCV"/>

A game also titled ''Akumajō Dracula'' was developed for the [[MSX2]] simultaneously. It was released a month after the Disk System game. It was released in Europe under the title ''[[Vampire Killer]]'' where it was the first game in the series to be released. The MSX2 version featured different areas and new gameplay.

===Versions and re-releases===
''Castlevania'' has been ported to a variety of different [[video game console]]s, [[handheld game console]]s, [[Personal computer|home computer systems]], and [[mobile phone]]s.

A [[ROM cartridge]] version of the game was released for the Japanese Family Computer in 1993. The release omitted the name registration screen from the original Famicom Disk version (as well as saving) and included an "Easy" mode.

In 2002, Konami released the first three NES ''Castlevania'' games for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] as ''Konami Collector's Series: Castlevania & Contra''.

In 2004, ''Castlevania'' was released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as part of the [[Classic NES Series]] published by Nintendo. The original end credits of the game, which consisted of puns on the names of horror movie stars, were removed in this version.

The original game was included as one of 30 games featured on the 2016 [[NES Classic Edition]].

The game is included in ''Castlevania Anniversary Collection'', a compilation released as part of Konami's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/18/18484715/castlevania-anniversary-collection-release-date-games|title=Konami reveals full Castlevania Anniversary Collection lineup|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=April 18, 2019}}</ref> In Japan, this compilation includes the 1993 Famicom port instead of the original version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201904/19175064.html|title=『悪魔城ドラキュラ アニバーサリーコレクション』5月16日に発売決定！シリーズ初期の代表作を8タイトル収録 &#124; ゲーム・エンタメ最新情報のファミ通.com|date=April 19, 2019|website=ファミ通.com|accessdate=September 19, 2023}}</ref> This contrasts the [[Virtual Console]] which used the Famicom Disk System version in all of its Japanese rereleases.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_adf/vc_adf_01.html | title=Vc 悪魔城ドラキュラ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/50010000012027 | title=悪魔城ドラキュラ &#124; ニンテンドー3Ds &#124; 任天堂 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000003924 | title=悪魔城ドラキュラ &#124; Wii U &#124; 任天堂 }}</ref>

It cited this game's absence from IGN's top 100 games of all time as well as the absence of the second and third ''Castlevanias'' from ''Game Informer''{{'}}s 'top 100 games of all time' list. It suggested that the reason this is the case is because of the NES games' high learning curve and difficulty level. It also felt that ''Symphony of the Night''{{'}}s influence on the series after its release caused people to forget about the NES games. It praised the Virtual Console for allowing players unfamiliar with these games to experience them more easily. IGN's Lucas M.
