== Plot ==
''King's Knight'' follows a basic storyline similar to many [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]-era [[role-playing video game]]s: Princess Claire of Olthea has been kidnapped in the Kingdom of Izander, and the player must choose one of the four heroes (the knight/warrior "Ray Jack", the wizard "Kaliva", the monster/gigant "Barusa" and the (kid) thief "Toby") to train and set forth to attack Gargatua Castle, defeat the evil dragon Tolfida and rescue the princess.<ref name="gamecase">{{cite book|title=King's Knight (Instruction Manual)|publisher=Square Soft, Inc|year=1989}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
[[File:King's Knight Screenshot 2 (Gameplay).png|thumb|right|The player battles enemies in the first stage using Ray Jack.]]

''King's Knight'' is a vertically [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]], where the main objective is to dodge or destroy all onscreen enemies and obstacles. Various items, however, add depth to the game. As any character, the player can collect various power-ups to increase a character's level (maximum of twenty levels per character): as many as seven Jump Increases, seven Speed Increases, three Weapon Increases, and three Shield Increases. There are also Life Ups, which are collected to increase the character's life meter. There are also Life Downs which should be avoided. Other onscreen icons can affect the stage, such as hidden cave entrances/exits and a "secret revealer", which reveals hidden stones that block progress. Finally, there are four types of elements to be collected in each level, which are vital to the completion of the last stage. These elements are simply elements A, B, C, and D.

Each stage has various power-ups, an element of each type, and a cave. Because caves in any given level always house at least one element type (not to mention various power-ups), it is vital that the player finds these. Caves are always hidden and are generally found in the middle of a stage. Caves also have statues that shoot fireballs, and at the end of each cave is a dragon to fight. Once the dragon is defeated, the player can exit the cave and continue with the level.

== Development and release ==
=== Differences between versions ===
[[File:King's knight MSX (boss design different).gif|thumb|left|The [[MSX]] version of ''King's Knight'' included a sidebar displaying the player's allocated items.]]

Differences were present not only in the Famicom and [[MSX]] versions of ''King's Knight'', but in the Japanese and North American versions as well.

The Japanese (Famicom) version and the American (NES) version of ''King's Knight'' differed little, with the title screen being the only disparity. Each title screen reflected the copyright and publisher.

The MSX version of ''King's Knight'' differed from the Famicom version in a variety of ways. The opening was modified so that prior to the intro screen, players could specify what type of controller they would like to use (either a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] or a [[joystick]]). The in-game dynamics were very similar, although some differences exist. In the MSX version, the flanks of the screen were "closed off", while the stage maps have moved slightly, and so some of the items appear to be out of their original locations. Finally, the MSX version may seem easier, because the characters can sustain more damage from attacks.

The developers also took advantage of technological capabilities available on the MSX. As an upgrade, the MSX port featured more sound channels than the Famicom, and as such many music tracks and sound effects were altered or improved. The MSX version also boasts a wider range of colors, updated graphics, new monster and boss designs (dragons at the end of caves, for example, were replaced with reptilian monsters), and a new sidebar, which displayed the player's life meter, allocated power-ups, and allocated elements. The MSX could not smoothly render vertical scrolling though – unlike the Famicom – so the movement of the graphics is very "choppy" in comparison. Some of these changes are very similar to the changes that took place when Square's ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' was ported to the MSX2.

In a retrospective review AllGame editor Skyler Miller was critical of the game. Miller noted that "the underlying gameplay is decent" but described the graphics as "elementary" and "the structure of switching characters is awkward and frustrating". Miller noted that the game showed "none of the creativity or innovation that Square would later be known for".<ref name="allgamereview"/>

''King's Knight'' was given a 3/10 on [[IGN]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/26/kings-knight-review|title=King's Knight Review|first=Lucas M.|last=Thomas|date=March 26, 2008|website=ign.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305091200/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/26/kings-knight-review|archivedate=March 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and 3/10 as well on [[Nintendo Life]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2008/03/kings_knight_virtual_console|title=Review: King's Knight (Virtual Console / NES)|date=March 25, 2008|website=nintendolife.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918160933/http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2008/03/kings_knight_virtual_console|archivedate=September 18, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
