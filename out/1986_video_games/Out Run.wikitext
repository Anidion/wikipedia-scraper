{{nihongo foot|'''''Out Run'''''|アウトラン|Auto Ran|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (also stylized as '''''OutRun''''') is an arcade [[driving video game]] released by [[Sega]] in September 1986. It is known for its pioneering hardware and graphics, [[nonlinear gameplay]], a selectable soundtrack with music composed by [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (composer)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]], and the hydraulic [[motion simulator]] deluxe [[arcade cabinet]]. The goal is to avoid traffic and reach one of five destinations.

The game was designed by [[Yu Suzuki]], who traveled to Europe to gain inspiration for the game's stages. Suzuki had a small team and only ten months to program the game, leaving him to do most of the work himself. The game was a critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing [[1987 in video games|arcade game of 1987]] worldwide as well as Sega's most successful arcade cabinet of the 1980s. It was ported to numerous video game consoles and home computers, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video games]] at the time and selling millions of copies worldwide, and it spawned a number of sequels. ''Out Run'' is considered one of the most influential and [[List of video games considered the best|greatest games ever made]], cited as an influence upon numerous later video games, playing a role in the [[arcade video game]] industry's recovery, and providing the name for a [[Synthwave|popular music genre]].

==Development==
During the mid-1980s, Sega experienced success in the arcades with games developed by [[Yu Suzuki]]. ''[[Hang-On]]'' was a good seller and ''[[Enduro Racer]]'' had been successful enough for Sega to consider a second production run. Both are motorcycle racing games, and ''Out Run'' was Suzuki's chance to develop a car racing game. His original concept was to base the game on the American film ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'',<ref name=":1" /> of which he was a fan.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2018|isbn=9781476631967|pages=112–114}}</ref><ref name="Robinson">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-22-out-ran-meeting-yu-suzuki|title=Out Ran: Meeting Yu Suzuki, Sega's original outsider|last=Robinson|first=Martin|date=22 March 2015|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220185846/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-22-out-ran-meeting-yu-suzuki|archive-date=20 December 2015|url-status=live|access-date=24 December 2015}}</ref> He disliked racing games where cars exploded on impact, and wanted gamers to enjoy the experience of driving and to feel "superior".<ref name=":0" />

Suzuki initially conceived the game's setting across the United States, and he requested to scout various locations there. According to Suzuki's boss, Youji Ishii, Sega president [[Hayao Nakayama]] believed the US was too unsafe, and suggested Europe as a safer option. Additionally, Suzuki concluded that the US was too "large and empty" for the game's design. He scouted Europe<ref name=":0" /> for two weeks in a [[BMW 520]] for ideas.<ref name="Robinson" /> This tour included [[Frankfurt]], [[Monaco]], [[Rome]],<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Robinson" /> the [[Swiss Alps]], the [[French Riviera]], [[Florence]],<ref name=":1" /> and [[Milan]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite magazine|last=Davies|first=Jonti|date=September 2008|title=The Making Of: OutRun|magazine=Retro Gamer|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=54|pages=26–33|issn=1742-3155}}</ref>  While in Monaco, Suzuki was inspired to use the [[Ferrari Testarossa]] as the playable car in the game, so when he returned to Japan he arranged for his team to find and photograph one.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Robinson" /> They took many photos of the car from every side and recorded the sound of the engine.<ref name=":6"/>

A small team of four programmers, a sound creator, and five graphic designers developed ''Out Run''. Suzuki had to use only personnel that were available and not assigned to other projects at the time. As a result, Suzuki did most of the programming and planning himself, spending extra hours at the studio to complete development of the game within ten months.<ref name=":0" /> He believed that the most difficult part of developing the game was to make it as fun as possible, which he achieved by emphasizing the design elements of wide roads, buildings, and a radio with soundtrack selection.<ref name=":1" />

[[Image:Out_Run.jpg|thumb|The sit-down deluxe [[motion simulator]] cabinet version of ''Out Run'']]

Four [[Arcade cabinet|cabinet]] designs were released, all of which are equipped with a [[steering wheel]], a [[stick shift]], and [[acceleration]] and [[brake]] pedals. Two of the cabinet designs are upright, the larger of which has [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] in the steering wheel. The other two models are sit-down [[motion simulator]] cabinets that resemble the in-game car and use a drive motor to move the main cabinet—turning and shaking according to the onscreen action. Both models feature stereo speakers mounted behind the driver's head.<ref name="crash" /><ref name="arcadeheroes">{{cite news |title=Sega's Wonderful Simulation Games Over The Years |url=https://arcadeheroes.com/2013/06/06/segas-wonderful-simulation-games-over-the-years/ |access-date=22 April 2021 |work=Arcade Heroes |date=6 June 2013}}</ref> The [[arcade system board]] made specifically for the game is the [[Sega OutRun]], based on the [[Sega System 16]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/outrun/|title=OutRun|last=Grazza|first=Brian|date=5 October 2017|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|publisher=Kurt Kalata|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014095055/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/outrun/|archive-date=14 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Suzuki said that he was often unable to make games based on existing hardware and that Sega would have to create a new board. He said that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from ''Hang-On''.

Suzuki also set about simulating car features that were previously lacking in earlier driving games, so that being a skillful driver in real life would translate to being skillful in the game. They simulated features such as [[horsepower]], [[torque]], [[gear ratios]] and [[tire]] engineering close to real cars. They also added [[Artificial intelligence in video games|AI]] assistance for features that were difficult to control, such as [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]]. For the drifting, they added details such as, if the car's tires grip the road surface too closely, the car's handling becomes too twitchy, something that wasn't appreciated in earlier driving games.<ref name=":6"/>

''Out Run''{{'}}s original score was composed by [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (composer)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]], who had previously composed [[soundtrack]]s for other games designed by Suzuki, including ''Hang-On''. The soundtrack is similar in style to [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] and [[Caribbean music]]. Three selectable tracks are featured: "Passing Breeze", "Splash Wave", and "Magical Sound Shower". An additional track, "Last Wave", plays at the final score screen.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":5" /> Some of the game's audio samples were corrupted due to one of the master ROM chips failing, and the glitch was not noticed until Sega was preparing a soundtrack box-set for the game's 20th anniversary. The correct files were recovered from an [[8-inch floppy disk]], and subsequent re-releases of the game use the fixed data.<ref>{{cite web |title=SEGA 3D Classics – 3D Out Run – Part 3 |url=http://blogs.sega.com/2015/03/09/sega-3d-classics-3d-out-run-part-3/ |website=SEGA Blog |access-date=8 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312131429/http://blogs.sega.com/2015/03/09/sega-3d-classics-3d-out-run-part-3/ |archive-date=12 March 2015 |date=9 March 2015}}</ref> [[Cassette tapes]] of the arcade soundtrack were distributed in the United Kingdom during December 1987, both with the home computer conversions and with ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Blast your ears!

Former Sega arcade director Akira Nagai has credited ''Out Run'' and similar games for Sega's arcade success in the 1980s. According to Nagai, "''Out Run'', in particular, was really amazing for its time... Suzuki went on to make ''[[After Burner]]'' and a number of other games, but ''Out Run'' is still talked about with a special kind of wonder. With the ''taikan'' games, Sega's arcade business, which had been Sega's lowest performer in sales, gradually started to rise... For me personally, ''[[Hang-On]]'' and ''Out Run'' are my most memorable titles.
