'''''Chiller''''' is a [[light gun]] [[arcade game]] released in 1986 by [[Exidy]].<ref name="klov">{{Cite web|title=Chiller|url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7328|access-date=2020-08-17|website=International Arcade Museum}}</ref> An unlicensed [[Porting|port]] was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990 by [[American Game Cartridges]] in the US, and in Australia by HES ([[Home Entertainment Suppliers]]), with the option of using either the standard controller or the [[NES Zapper]].

In the game, the player takes on the role of an unseen [[torture]]r who must maim, mutilate, and murder restrained [[non-player character]]s in a variety of [[dungeon]] settings. Few of the NPCs in the game are capable of fighting back, with the challenge element lying in how quickly the player can cause each of the victims to die.

== Gameplay ==

The game consists of four main levels: the ''torture chamber'', the ''rack room'', the ''haunted house hallway'', and the ''graveyard''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veterangamers.co.uk/blog/2011/03/16/controversial-games-chiller/|title=Controversial Games: Chiller|website=Veteran Gamers|date=16 March 2011|access-date=December 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221012185321/http://www.veterangamers.co.uk/blog/2011/03/16/controversial-games-chiller/|archive-date=October 12, 2022}}</ref> If enough score is accumulated by completing these levels successfully, a final ''bonus round'' is unlocked, which consists of a [[target practice]] where objects traveling at increasingly high speeds must be shot. Between each level, a bonus score can be obtained by winning at the [[slot machine]].<ref name="klov" />

The first two levels feature seemingly human NPCs restrained by [[medieval torture devices]]. The player must discover how to kill these characters in the shortest possible amount of time. Although it is possible to shoot them to death, this process is inefficient as direct shots only result in chunks of flesh being blown away, leaving the victims alive.<ref name="gamespot">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-two-tribes-go-to-war-a-history-of-video-game-controversy/1100-6090892/|title=When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy |first1=Lauren|last1=Gonzalez|first2=Collin|last2=Oguro|date=7 March 2004|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213652/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-two-tribes-go-to-war-a-history-of-video-game-controversy/1100-6090892/|archive-date=May 9, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Instead, the challenge lies in finding ways to activate the torture devices, resulting in quicker and bloodier deaths.

After the first two levels, the game transitions into a more traditional [[shooting game]]; the player must kill [[paranormal]] creatures, such as [[zombie]]s, [[ghost]]s, and [[mummy|mummies]].<ref name="kotaku">{{Cite web|title=The Story Of Chiller, One Very Messed Up Video Game|url=https://kotaku.com/the-story-of-chiller-one-very-messed-up-video-game-1829528354|access-date=2020-08-17|website=Kotaku|first=Luke|last=Winkie|date=10 April 2018}}</ref><!--

For each screen, shooting all available targets gives the player a bonus shooting round. The game features a Ghost counter on-screen scoring system named the "Ectoplasmic Tabulator". It has very similar gameplay to ''[[Crossbow (video game)|Crossbow]]'' and other related Exidy 440 board system games. -->

== Reception ==

The game sold poorly in the United States because arcade owners refused to purchase it; Exidy successfully marketed it to [[third world country|third world countries]].<ref name="gamespot" /> Modern reviewers often criticize the game for its senseless violence and encouraging the torture and murder of apparently innocent people, as opposed to the gamer fighting enemies capable of defending themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/nintendo/best-nes-zapper-games|title=Ranking Every Original NES Zapper Game|last=Martin|first=Garrett|website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=April 21, 2023|access-date=December 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230423235428/https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/nintendo/best-nes-zapper-games|archive-date=April 23, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/kwpykz/a-bloody-history-of-gore-in-video-games-mike-diver-114|title=A Disgusting History of Gore in Video Games|last=Diver|first=Mike|website=[[Waypoint (website)|Waypoint]]|date=November 4, 2014|access-date=December 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221226042057/http://www.vice.com/en/article/kwpykz/a-bloody-history-of-gore-in-video-games-mike-diver-114|archive-date=December 26, 2022}}</ref>
