'''''Super Sprint''''' (known as '''''Sprint Master''''' on the [[Atari 2600]])<ref name="Weiss" /> is a [[racing video game]] released by [[Atari Games]] and [[Midway Games]] in 1986. Up to three players drive [[Formula One]]-like cars on a circuit that is viewed from above.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9952}}</ref> The game is a successor to ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' and the ''[[Sprint 2|Sprint]]'' series, which were black-and-white games from the 1970s. A sequel, '''''Championship Sprint''''', was released later in the same year.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC Super Sprint.png|left|thumb|Arcade screenshot]]
Up to three players drive simultaneously on a circuit against opponents controlled by the computer. The circuits are viewed from above and always fit on the screen, so the game never [[scrolling|scrolls]]. After three laps the winner advances to the next circuit. There are eight circuits in total, but the game only ends if gamers can get to race 85 where the bonus Super Speedway circuit is played. As the player goes to higher levels, more and more obstacles appear on the track, like oil puddles and tiny moving tornadoes. If the car touches them, the player loses control over the car for a short time while it is sliding and spinning. Driving into a wall with high speed or falling from one of the bridges destroys the car, but a helicopter will appear to replace it.

The car can be customized by collecting wrenches that lie on the track. The player can exchange three of them for improved traction, better acceleration or higher top speed.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Super Sprint'' on their August 15, 1986 issue as being the second most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=290|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 August 1986|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref> It became Japan's eighth highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade game during the latter half of 1986,<ref name="GM300">{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '86 下半期 |trans-title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: Second Half '86 |magazine=Game Machine |issue=300 |publisher=Amusement Press, Inc. |date=15 January 1987 |page=16 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19870115p.pdf#page=9}}</ref> and the ninth highest-grossing upright/cockpit [[1986 in video games|arcade game of 1986]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '86 上半期 |trans-title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: First Half '86 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=288 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=15 July 1986 |page=28 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19860715p.pdf#page=15}}</ref><ref name="GM300"/> It was later Japan's tenth highest-grossing upright/cockpit [[1987 in video games|arcade game of 1987]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '87 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=324 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=15 January 1988 |page=20 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19880115p.pdf#page=11}}</ref>

In 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' listed the arcade version as number 59 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time". They explained that while the massive [[understeer]] in the game is highly unrealistic, it adds a sense of urgency to the gameplay.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 100 Games of All Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=September 1996|page=48}}</ref>

It was ported to the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Commodore 64]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/championship-sprint |title=Championship Sprint for Amstrad CPC (1988) |publisher=MobyGames |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2011-08-30}}</ref>

===Rereleases===
A [[Game Boy Advance]] version was released along with ''[[Spy Hunter]]'' in a dual-game pack in 2005.
