''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' wrote: "Here is a completely novel game system, with a mixture of cartoon style graphics amid digitised pictures, plus some catchy music, that has taken over a year to reach the UK. What a shame! I wonder why!"<ref name="CVG"/> ''[[Commodore User]]'' called it "the most polished and absorbing game."<ref name="CUser"/> ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' said the graphics are of poor quality, conversations are amusing but limited and concluded that it's "a game for mugs".<ref name="ACE"/> ''[[Zzap!64]]'' called the audiovisual presentation atmospheric and said the game overall is "quite good".<ref name="Z64"/> ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' said the graphics are outdated but don't distract from the dense atmosphere.<ref name="ASM"/> ''[[Tilt (French magazine)|Tilt]]'' said there's no apparent difference between the Apple and Commodore versions: both have the same limited graphics but retain "the power of seduction".<ref name="TILT"/>
