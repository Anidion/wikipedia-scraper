'''''Victory Road''''', also known as {{nihongo|'''''Dogō Sōken'''''|怒号層圏|lit. "Bellowing Atmosphere"}} in Japan and '''''Ikari Warriors II: Victory Road''''' in North America,<ref name="HG101"/> is a [[run and gun video game]] released by [[SNK]] for [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1986. The game is a sequel to ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'', released earlier the same year.

==Gameplay==
The original arcade game featured an 8-way [[rotary switch|rotary]] joystick that could be twisted in place to rotate the onscreen character allowing the player to face in one of eight directions while moving in another.

It features sampled voiceovers from the main characters and the game's bosses.

The NES version includes the added feature of collecting "zeny" as currency, which is used to buy improved weaponry and armor. The NES version emulates the controls of the arcade version by locking the facing of the character in one direction for as long as the "fire" button is depressed. Weapons no longer have limited ammunition. The player character begins with a flamethrower but, when the player loses a life, it is changed to a machine gun.

Weapon powerups are scattered throughout the levels, often hidden under rocks destroyable by the bazooka weapon or grenades.

There are no vehicles in this game, but it was replaced by armour, which allows player to take a limited number of hits without time expiration.

The game reuses the single-stage design from its predecessor, but added mini-stages where players fight a boss when entered through the green door.

==Plot==
The objective is to defeat the enemy aliens using grenades and other weapons. The story directly picks up at the ending of ''Ikari Warriors''. Congratulated by General Kawasaki for rescuing him, Paul and Vince return home to their native country in a plane arranged by the general. A mysterious storm appears and they are hurtled thousands of years into the future. They are met by an alien creature who says that the villain Zang Zip has taken over the land.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Victory Road'' on their December 1, 1986 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=297|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 December 1986|page=23|lang=ja}}</ref>
