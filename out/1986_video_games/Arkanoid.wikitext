{{nihongo foot|'''''Arkanoid'''''|アルカノイド|Arukanoido|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1986 [[Block kuzushi|block breaker]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Taito]]. In North America, it was published by [[Romstar]]. Controlling a paddle-like craft known as the Vaus, the player is tasked with clearing a formation of colorful blocks by deflecting a ball towards it without letting the ball leave the bottom edge of the playfield. Some blocks contain power-ups that have various effects, such as increasing the length of the Vaus, creating several additional balls, or equipping the Vaus with cannons. Other blocks may be indestructible or require multiple hits to break.

Created by Taito designers Akira Fujita and Hiroshi Tsujino, ''Arkanoid'' expanded on the concept established in [[Atari, Inc.]]'s ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', a successful game in its own right that was met with a large wave of similar clone games from other manufacturers. It was part of a contest within Taito, where two teams of designers had to complete a block breaker game and determine which one was superior to the other. The film ''[[Tron]]'' served as inspiration for the game's futuristic, neon aesthetic. Level designs were sketched on paper before being programmed and tested to make sure they were fun to play. The enemy and power-up designs were 3D models converted into sprite art.

Early location tests for ''Arkanoid'' surpassed Taito's initial expectations. It became a major commercial success in arcades, becoming the highest-grossing [[table arcade cabinet]] of [[1987 in video games|1987]] in Japan and the year's highest-grossing conversion kit in the United States. The game was commended by critics for its gameplay, simplicity, addictive nature, and improvements over the original ''Breakout'' concept. The game revitalized the genre and set the groundwork for many games to follow. ''Arkanoid'' was ported to many home video game platforms, including the [[Commodore 64]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and (years later) [[mobile phone]]s, and it spawned a long series of sequels and updates over the course of two decades.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Arkanoid.png|thumb|left|The start of a level (arcade version)]]
''Arkanoid'' is a block breaker video game. Its plot involves the starship Arkanoid being attacked by a mysterious entity from space named DOH. A small paddle-shaped craft, the Vaus, is ejected from the Arkanoid.

The player controls the Vaus, moving it from side to side in order to hit a ball into an pattern of bricks and destroy them. After all bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to the next level and faces a new pattern. Most bricks can be destroyed in one hit; some require multiple hits, and others cannot be destroyed at all. Some bricks release capsules that bestow various power-ups when caught, such as increasing the length of the Vaus, temporarily slowing the ball down, or granting an extra life. Floating enemies/obstacles emerge onto the screen at times and can be hit for bonus points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=106 |title=Arkanoid The [Coin-Op] Arcade Video Game by Taito Corp. [Japan]| publisher=The International Arcade Museum|access-date=2014-09-19}}</ref>

On the final stage (33 on most versions, but 36 on the NES), the player takes on the game's [[boss (video games)|boss]], "DOH". Once this point is reached, the player no longer has the option to continue after running out of lives, making this segment more difficult. The game is over regardless of the outcome.

If the player succeeds in defeating "DOH", the game rewards them by showing the ending, in which time starts to flow backwards, and Vaus escapes the distorted space just in time to return to the Arkanoid, which has also reversed back to perfect condition. The game's text warns, however, that the journey has only started, and that the player has not seen the last of "DOH".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th-Z6QQ5AOQ|title=Arcade Longplay [270] Arkanoid|accessdate=18 December 2022|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

==Development and release==

The arcade game was reviewed in ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' by Clare Edgeley in November 1986, where she compared it to ''[[Pong]]'' and ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in its simplicity and addictiveness.

In 1997, ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' editors ranked the NES version the 41st best console video game of all time, describing it as "the type of game that you'd pick up because you need a quick video game fix but would end up playing for hours". They particularly noted that despite the ability to shoot lasers, the game demanded a great deal of skill from the player.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=100 Best Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|pages=130, 134}} Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.</ref>

==Legacy==
''Arkanoid'' was followed by a number of direct and indirect sequels. ''Tournament Arkanoid'' <ref>{{KLOV game|name=Tournament Arkanoid|id=10174}}</ref> was released in 1987 exclusively in the United States by Romstar. Developed by Taito America rather than Taito Japan, it has the same gameplay as ''Arkanoid'', but adds new levels.  ''[[Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh|Revenge of Doh]]'', a true sequel with new gameplay mechanics, was released in arcades in 1987.
