== Reception ==
''ZX Computing'':  "''Mantronix'' puts less emphasis on problem-solving than the [[Ultimate Play the Game|Ultimate]] games, but it is a good tricky shoot 'em up, with a large playing area that should keep your trigger finger flexing for a long time."<ref name="ZX Computing Review">{{Citation|title=Mantronix Review|journal=ZX Computing|date=August 1986}}</ref>
