{{nihongo|'''''Super Pitfall'''''|スーパーピットフォール|Sūpā Pittofōru}} is a 1986 [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] non-linear [[platform game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). Despite the title screen stating that it was reprogrammed by [[Pony Canyon|Pony Inc]], the development of the NES version was handled by [[Micronics]], a Japanese developer who mostly ported arcade games to the NES.

''Super Pitfall'' was the first game that Activision published as a third-party developer for the NES. Following the original release of the game, ports were made in Japan by Makoto Ichinoseki for the [[PC-8800 series]] liner of computers and by Steve Bjork for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer 3]]. The game initially received positive reviews from ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'' and ''[[Computer Entertainer]]'' while [[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]] wrote in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' found the game did not control well and did not stand out well in a market of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' clones. Retrospective reviews of the NES game from game critic Brett Weiss and Stuart Hunt of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' found the game a step down from the previous ''Pitfall'' games on the [[Atari 2600]], with both faulting low quality graphics and game design.

Activision initially was going distribute [[Sunsoft]]'s ''[[Atlantis no Nazo]]'' in the United States in a rebranded form as a sequel to ''Super Pitfall'' on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. This release did not happen.

==Gameplay==

The game features Pitfall Harry as the [[player character]].{{sfn|Metzger|1987|p=1}} Equipped with a gun, he seeks to recover the Raj diamond from a vast subterranean dwelling in the [[Andes Mountains]] and rescue his niece Rhonda and cat friend Quickclaw the Lion who are trapped deep in the caverns.{{sfn|Metzger|1987|p=1}} The goal is to move Harry through a nonlinear cave maze finding the two trapped friends and collect the Raj diamond and return to the starting point.{{sfn|Marriott}}{{sfn|Metzger|1987|p=4}} While playing, Harry will find that Rhonda has turned to stone and Quickclaw is trapped and both require items to be freed. To return home, Harry must collect a photograph of the Underground Kingdom for a clue on how to return entrance.{{sfn|Metzger|1987|p=4}} Harry begins with three lives and on touching an enemy or a hazard he loses one.

He can jump and fire his gun with the a and b buttons respectively.{{sfn|Metzger|1987|p=2-3}} Harry can collect items shaped like playing card suits to open rock doors as well as spare pistols and items that make him invulnerable to enemies. Items in the game are invisible and can only be grabbed at certain moments while jumping.{{sfn|Metzger|1987|p=5}}

==Development==
''Super Pitfall'' was developed by the Japanese company Micronics.{{sfn|Hunt|2012|p=84}} Micronics predominantly did work in outsourcing tasks and generally made [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) versions of popular arcade titles such as ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' and ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]''.{{sfn|Alpert|2010}} Stuart Hunt of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' described the game as a loose port of the Atari 2600 game ''[[Pitfall II: Lost Caverns]]''.{{sfn|Hunt|2012|p=84}}

In Japan, the game was released for the PC-8801MKIISR model in the [[PC-8800 series]] of home computers. It was designed by Makoto Ichinoseki.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=BASIC|title=Super Pitfall|date=February 1987|language=Japanese}}</ref> Steve and Monique Bjork contributed to the [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer 3]] (CoCo 3) port of ''Super Pitfall''. Steven had written the code for it and over 20 Tandy and Color Computer programs, while Monique contributed to the graphics in the game.{{sfn|Parker|1989|p=75}}{{sfn|Olive|1988|p=132}} The CoCo 3 version, three difficulty options are made available, in expert mode: the items Harry seeks are invisible while in explorer mode Harry has unlimited lives and treasures remain visible.{{sfn|Olive|1988|p=132}}

The new version of the game changing the visuals, redesigning levels and even including all new music.{{sfn|Lopes|2016}}

==Reception==
[[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]] wrote in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' found the playing character's movement was slow and floaty and that its gameplay and visuals were too similar to that ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985). Kunkel concluded that "there is nothing in the game itself to keep [NES users] awake."{{sfn|Kunkel|1988|pp=44-45}} A review in ''[[Computer Entertainer]]'' found the game gave players plenty to explore, specifically noting large amount of secret areas and hidden objects and recommended it to fans of the two previous ''Pitfall'' games on the Atari 2600.{{sfn|Computer Entertainer includes The Video Game Update|1988|ref=CE-May1988|p=10}} ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'' gave the game a high grade of four for its action and lower points of two for its music and sound, declaring the game to be a "higher quality" form than its previous entries.{{sfn|VideoGames & Computer Entertainment|1988|p=43|ref=VGCE}}
Tony Olive in ''[[The Rainbow (magazine)|The Rainbow]]'' reviewed the CoCo port, praising the graphics as arcade-quality, with smooth movement, and finding the game to be fun and challenging.{{sfn|Olive|1988|p=132}}

From retrospective reviews, Stuart Hunt wrote in ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' that the game was derided by most fans of the ''Pitfall'' series. Hunt specifically noted poor collisions detection, flickering sprites and stiff animation and that a lot of the game play involved frustrating trial and error. Hunt also found that having a weapon in the game was useless as it passed over most enemies heads and that the sprite of the player looked too much like [[Mario]] in a safari hat.{{sfn|Hunt|2012|p=84}} Brett Weiss, in his book ''Classic Home Video Games, 1985-1988'' (2009) found the game to have awful music and graphics and generic level design finding it far inferior to the previous Atari 2600 games.{{sfn|Weiss|2009|p=185}}
