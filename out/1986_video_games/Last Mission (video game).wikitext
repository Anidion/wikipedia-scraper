'''''Last Mission''''' is a top-down [[multidirectional shooter]] developed by [[Data East]] and distributed in worldwide release for the arcades in 1986. The game is similar to ''[[Time Pilot]]'' as players have full movement control over their ship and can move it in all eight directions.

==Plot==
The players assume the role of an alien-humanoid space pilot who has been exiled from their home galaxy for committing an unlearned crime. The only way the player character can return is to restore their honor; the only way to do so is to invade and defeat the alien invaders who have been known to frequently attack the player character's people using a ship called the Main Fighter.

==Reception==
