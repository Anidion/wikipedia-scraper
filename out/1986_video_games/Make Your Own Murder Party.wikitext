'''''Make Your Own Murder Party''''' is a 1986 [[role-playing video game]].

== Gameplay ==
The host of the [[murder mystery game]] inputs a series of data about their party guests, and the game automatically generates a mystery with a murder, motives, and a series of clues. These are all able to be printed as player booklets. The game is also able to print invites for the guests, and offers advice on how to host the perfect murder mystery. Once the booklets have been printed out, the game becomes purely physical like a normal murder mystery party; the game simply allows a streamlined process to generate a mystery.
