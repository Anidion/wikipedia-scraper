{{nihongo foot|'''''Valis: The Fantasm Soldier'''''|夢幻戦士ヴァリス|Mugen Senshi: Varisu|lit. "Dream Soldier: Valis"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1986 [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] originally developed by [[Wolf Team]] and published by [[Telenet Japan]] for the [[MSX]], [[PC-8800 series|PC-8801]], [[X1 (computer)|X1]], [[FM-7]], and [[PC-9800 series|PC-9801]] home computers. It is the first entry in the ''[[Valis (video game series)|Valis]]'' series.  It stars Yuko Asou, a Japanese teenage schoolgirl chosen as the Valis warrior and wielder of the mystical Valis sword to protect the Earth, the land of spirits, and the dream world Vecanti from demon lord Rogles. Throughout the journey, the player explores and search for [[Item (gaming)|item]]s and [[power-up]]s, while fighting enemies and defeating [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to increase Yuko's attributes.

Programmers Masahiro Akishino and Osamu Ikegame began planning on a side-scrolling action game featuring a customed delinquent heroine, an idea originated from ''[[Sukeban Deka]]'' to compete in a contest sponsored by Japanese computer magazine ''LOGiN'', being kept secret within Telenet until they approved development to continue when the company learned of its existence. After a Telenet superior expressed disliking towards its graphics, writer Hiroki Hayashi was ordered to take action and fix it, leading to the conception of ''Valis''. Akishino and Hayashi used Ikegame's work as basis to introduce their own story and character ideas, which were based on an unfinished personal novel Hayashi wrote prior to the game's production.

''Valis'' sold well and was listed as one of the best-selling games in 1987 rankings. An almost completely reworked version was also released for the [[Family Computer]], followed by remakes for the [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] and [[PC Engine Super CD-ROM²]], and a version for [[mobile phone]]s as well. The game was supplemented with [[manga]] adaptations, an anime short by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], albums from [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] and [[Wave Master]],  and [[doujinshi]] books. Critical reception has varied depending on the version; the original MSX version garnered mixed reviews while the Genesis remake carried average sentiments, however the enhanced PC Engine remake was received more favorably. It was followed by ''[[Valis II]]'' (1989).

== Gameplay and premise ==
[[File:MSX Valis - The Fantasm Soldier (Mugen Senshi - Varisu).png|frame|left|Gameplay screenshot of the [[MSX]] version]]
''Valis: The Fantasm Soldier'' is an action-platform game starring Yuko Asou,{{efn|{{nihongo|麻生 優子|Asou Yūko}}}} a Japanese schoolgirl teenager who is fated to protect three different realms – the Earth, the land of spirits, and the dream world Vecanti. The demon lord Rogles{{efn|{{nihongo|ログレス|Roguresu}}}} extinguishes a light, which acts as a source of power for the inhabitants of Vecanti. In a desperate plea for salvation, the queen of Vecanti, Valia,{{efn|{{nihongo|ヴァリア|Varia}}}} reaches out for a brave soul who can help them in their time of despair, with Yuko being the one who answers the call. Yuko is magically summoned into becoming the Valis warrior by wielding the titular sword to liberate Vecanti from the evil of Rogles. Yuko's classmate, Reiko Kirishima,{{efn|{{nihongo||桐島 麗子|Kirishima Reiko}}}} is brainwashed by Rogles into helping him and destroy Yuko.<ref name="ValisHG101"/><ref name="VTFSum">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/FantasmSoldierValis1986TelenetJapanJP|title=夢幻戦士ヴァリス|date=1986|publisher=[[Telenet Japan]]|edition=Japanese|type=取扱説明書}}</ref>

Gameplay varies depending on the platform, but each version retains the same basic plot; in the original [[MSX]], [[PC-8800 series|PC-8801]] and [[X1 (computer)|X1]] versions, as well as the [[FM-7]] and [[PC-9800 series|PC-9801]] ports, ''Valis'' is a side-scrolling game where the player controls Yuko to fight through each level's enemies while jumping across ledges, exploring and searching for [[Item (gaming)|item]]s and [[power-up]]s, before confronting a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end of each level to increase Yuko's maximum [[Health (game terminology)|health]] and attributes. At certain points in the game, gameplay pauses, and cinematic [[cutscene]]s play regarding the game's plot.<ref name="ValisHG101"/><ref name="VTFSum"/> The [[Family Computer]] version differs considerably from the other versions, being more akin to a side-scrolling [[action role-playing game]]. It is a more difficult game due to its larger maze-style levels with multiple paths, and a lack of a password or save feature.<ref name="ValisHG101"/>

The [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] remake exhibits a gameplay system more similar to later games in the ''[[Valis (video game series)|Valis]]'' series, particularly ''[[Valis III]]''; the [[d-pad]] moves the main character and three buttons allow Yuko to perform three actions: sliding, jumping, and swinging her sword, which can be upgraded three times. The player can also use magic spells, gaining them after defeating bosses.<ref name="ValisHG101"/> The [[PC Engine Super CD-ROM²]] remake features changes to the gameplay system (e.g. single high jumps instead of two-phase jumps, a sliding move damaging enemies) and voiced cutscenes.<ref name="ValisHG101"/> The [[mobile phone]] version further added new stages and alternate costumes.

Akishino and programmer Osamu Ikegame started planning on a project tentatively titled ''Shoujo Furyou Densetsu'',{{efn|{{nihongo|少女不良伝説|Shōjo Furyō Densetsu}}}} a side-scrolling action game featuring a customed delinquent heroine, who would have served as a vehicle to showcase the action.<ref name="GemuShoku"/><ref name="GRTTb2">{{cite web|last=Hayashi|first=Hiroki|url=http://park3.wakwak.com/~garakutaten/data/valis/valis_data/valis_tanjyou_hiwa.htm|script-title=ja:『夢幻戦士ヴァリス』製作資料 - ヴァリス誕生秘話: 【 「ヴァリス」の開発母体となった幻のゲーム『少女不良伝説』…ヴァリス誕生秘話 】 - 『夢幻戦士ヴァリス』誕生秘話|work=我楽多展 - GA・RAKU・TA・TEN|date=2006|access-date=2022-04-09|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827022233/http://park3.wakwak.com/~garakutaten/data/valis/valis_data/valis_tanjyou_hiwa.htm|archive-date=2006-08-27|url-status=live}}</ref> The idea originated from ''[[Sukeban Deka]]'', particularly the [[live-action]] television adaptation, as both Akishino and Ikegame were fans of the series.<ref name="GemuShoku"/><ref name="GRTTb2"/> The project was made as an entry for "Program Olympics", a contest sponsored by Japanese computer magazine ''LOGiN'' where game developers created software to compete.<ref name="GRTTb2"/><ref name="LOGiNv4i10">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/logi-n-october-1985/page/n85/mode/2up|title=「プログラムオリンピック2」|magazine=[[:ja:ログイン (雑誌)|LOGiN]]|volume=4|issue=10|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation]]|date=October 1985|pages=92–119|lang=ja}}</ref> The game was kept secret within Telenet, but when the company learned of its existence, they approved development to continue.<ref name="GRTTb2"/>
