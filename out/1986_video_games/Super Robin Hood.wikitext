'''''Super Robin Hood''''' is a [[Robin Hood]]-themed [[platform game]] published in November 1986 by [[Codemasters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olivertwins.com/superrobinhood|title=Super Robin Hood|publisher=The Oliver Twins}}</ref>

The [[Oliver Twins]] developed the game for the [[Amstrad CPC]] when they were age 17; it was their first game published by Codemasters. Codemasters offered the brothers Â£10,000 for the game, because the company expected to sell 100,000 copies with royalties of 10p per unit sold. The twins worked on a single computer in a bedroom of their parents' house. Working in shifts, they coded for 18 to 23 hours per day; they took 30 minute breaks to allow the computer to cool. Sometimes, one brother coded on paper while the other used the computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olivertwins.com/our-story|title=The Codemasters Years|publisher=The Oliver Twins}}</ref>

The game was well-received by critics, and sold well.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} After Codemasters asked the brothers to produce another game, they developed ''[[Ghost Hunters (game)|Ghost Hunters]]'', which was released in January 1987.

Codemasters reworked ''Super Robin Hood'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], although issues with Nintendo meant it was only released on the four-in-one NES cartridge ''[[Quattro Adventure]]''.<ref name='oliverrobin'>{{cite web |title=The Oliver Twins|website=Robin Hood Legend Quest|publisher=The Oliver Twins|date=2021|url=https://www.olivertwins.com/robinhoodlegendquest|access-date=28 March 2022}}</ref> This reworked version was also released in 1993<ref name='oliverrobin' /> for 8-bit and 16-bit home computers as '''''Robin Hood: Legend Quest''''' to avoid confusion with the original game.<ref name='oliverrobin' />
