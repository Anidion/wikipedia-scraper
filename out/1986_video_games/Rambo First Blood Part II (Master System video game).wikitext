'''''Rambo: First Blood Part II''''' (stylized on-screen as '''''Rambo''''') is an overhead [[run and gun video game]] loosely based on the 1985 film [[Rambo: First Blood Part II|of the same name]] that was published in [[North America]] by [[Sega]] for the [[Master System]] in 1986 and then re-released as a budget title in 1990. It was originally released in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Ashura'''''|{{ruby|阿修羅|アシュラ}}}}, where it was released without the [[Rambo (film series)|Rambo license]].

Another version was released in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]] titled '''''Secret Command''''' (stylized on-screen as '''''Secret Commando'''''), which also lacked the Rambo license. A [[Rambo (1985 video game)|separate game based on the same film]] had previously been released on the 8-bit computers.

== Gameplay ==
''Rambo'' is an overhead action shoot-'em-up in the vein of ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'' and ''[[Ikari Warriors]]''. The first player controls Rambo, who is armed with an [[M60 machine gun|M-60]] machine gun with unlimited ammunition (which can only fire two shots on-screen) and a limited supply of explosive arrows used to take out tougher obstacles such as tanks and gates. A second player can play at the same time and control Rambo's partner Zane (a character created for the game), who wears a yellow headband. The objective of the game is to fight through the enemy's defenses, reach the gate at the end of each stage and then defeat as many enemy reinforcements as possible until the gate starts flashing in different colors. The player starts off the game with three lives and gains another one for completing each stage. A second player can join in anytime during the first stage as well until the second stage, in which the game will end for either player if one's lives run out.

Unlike the aforementioned games, the player can only shoot in five directions (left, up, right, or diagonally up-left or up-right), even though movement is allowed for all eight basic directions. When the player moves downward, the player character will have his weapon aimed upwards. However, enemies can shoot diagonally upwards. Power-ups are obtained by killing a specific number of enemy soldiers or as bonuses from the prisoners when they are freed from the huts located throughout the first four stages (which are only destroyable with arrows). Only one power-up can be on screen at a time, so if there is one dropped by an enemy at the time a prisoner should drop another, the prisoner will simply leave. These power-ups increase the range of shots, speed, the number of arrows and improve the firepower of the arrows hitting in four directions after the first explosion. There are also "?" marks, which can kill all enemies in the screen or add a life.

The player starts out each life with a supply of five explosive arrows, and gains two more with every item collected, no matter which item it is (although the in-game counter maxes out at "9", the player can actually carry more than that).

== Release ==
''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' was originally released in Japan as ''Ashura''. The Japanese version of the game had players controlling a pair of armed Buddhist monks named [[Asura (Buddhism)|Ashura]] and [[Vaisravana|Bishamon]], who are on a mission to rescue their kidnapped friends from the enemy.

When the game was being localized for the American market, Sega bought the license to base the game on ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''. The Player 1 character was redesigned to resemble Rambo, while Player 2 was replaced with a similar character who serves as Rambo's partner. The artwork on the title screen was replaced with a reproduction of [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s pose from the film's theatrical poster, while the original title theme was replaced by a [[Programmable Sound Generator|PSG]] rendition of [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s theme music from the movie. Some adjustments were also made to the game's difficulty (flamethrower soldiers for example, who could only could be killed using arrows in ''Ashura'', are now vulnerable to regular gunshots in ''Rambo''). The visuals on the Stage Clear screen, which originally showed various Asian landscapes and buildings in ''Ashura'', were replaced with images of Rambo in various action poses.

The game was modified again for its release in [[PAL region|PAL territories]], as the Rambo license was only usable for its North American release. As a result, the PAL version, ''Secret Command'', combines elements from the previous two versions. The main characters are referred to as "Bishamon" and "Ashura" in the manual, but they still retain their designs from ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''. The title music is also the same one from ''Ashura'', but the artwork is different. The Stage Clear visuals are once again illustrations of Asian landscapes.

Both the Japanese (''Ashura'') and European (''Secret Command'') versions would later be released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]], in their original release regions. ''Secret Command'' was also released for the North American VC service as well, as an "Import" title.
