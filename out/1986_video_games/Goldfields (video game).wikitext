}}'''Goldfields''' is a computer game for children which simulates 'life on the diggings' during a 19th-century gold rush. Beginning with a concept by Trevor Jacob, it was developed and published by [[Jacaranda Software]] in [[Australia]] in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://playitagainproject.org/games/goldfields/|title = Goldfields|access-date = 2015-01-27|website = Play it again...}}</ref> It was first released for [[Apple II]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.gamebase64.com/game.php?id=3212&d=45|title = Goldfields|access-date = 2015-01-27|website = Gamebase 64}}</ref> and IBM compatible systems.<ref name=":0" /> The first [[Macintosh]] version was later developed using [[Hypercard]].<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/222816122|title = Goldfields : a simulation of life on the diggings|access-date = 2015-01-27|via = OCLC World Cat| oclc=222816122 }}</ref> The original ''Goldfields'' package contained a disk, teacher's guide, four black-line masters and a copy of ''A Goldfields Journal'' or ''A Guide to Prospective Gold Seekers''. A review in ''Australian Educational Computing'' magazine described it as 'a particularly useful package, adaptable to a number of levels in both upper primary and secondary social science classes.'<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url = http://acce.edu.au/sites/acce.edu.au/files/pj/journal/AEC%20Vol%201%20No%201%201986%20Software%20reviews.pdf|title = Software Reviews - Goldfields|date = 1986-07-01|journal = Australian Educational Computing|access-date = 2015-01-27}}</ref> The game also received a favourable review from the ''Australian Journal of Reading'' in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=469367102008934;res=IELHSS|title = Australian Journal of Reading Volume 9 Issue 4|date = 1986-11-01|access-date = 2015-01-27|website = Informit}}</ref> Despite its age, ''Goldfields'' remains well regarded as a mining-themed economic simulator with integrated action sequences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.squakenet.com/download/goldfields/893/ |title=Strategy > 1990 > Goldfields |access-date=2015-01-27 |website=Squakenet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918223743/http://www.squakenet.com/download/goldfields/893/ |archive-date=2013-09-18 }}</ref>

Due to its ongoing popularity with children and educators, it was rewritten from scratch for [[Windows]] XP and [[Macintosh]] OSX by [[Greygum Software]] in 2007,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.greygum.com.au/nebula/|title = Greygum Software|date = 2007-01-22|access-date = 2015-01-27|website = Greygum Software}}</ref> who bought the rights to the title after Jacaranda Software's closure in the early 1990s.

An emulated version is available to play on archive.org.
