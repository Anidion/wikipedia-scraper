'''''Warship''''' is a 1986 [[computer wargame]] designed by [[Gary Grigsby]] and published by [[Strategic Simulations]]. It covers naval conflict during the [[Pacific War]].

In 1987, Grigsby followed ''Warship'' with ''[[Battle Cruiser (video game)|Battle Cruiser]]'', which reuses the gameplay system but expands the scope to cover both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

==Gameplay==
''Warship'' is a [[computer wargame]] that simulates [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater]] naval surface combat during [[World War II]].<ref name="CGW34"/> It is set between 1941 and 1945, and focuses on the conflict between [[Imperial Japan]] and the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and [[Netherlands]]. The game contains a "construction kit" that allows the player to create custom scenarios.<ref name=vgce />

==Development==
''Warship'' was designed by [[Gary Grigsby]] and was released in 1986, the same year he launched ''[[Battle Group (video game)|Battle Group]]''.<ref name=guru>{{cite magazine | author=Emrich, Alan | title=The Pioneering Spirit of a Wargame Guru | date=September 1995 | issue=134 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=201, 202, 204 }}</ref> It was published by [[Strategic Simulations]].<ref name=vgce>{{cite journal | author=Katz, Arnie | title=Waging World War II: Military Simulations for Computers and Video Games | date=February 1989 | journal=[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]] | pages=76–82 }}</ref>

Bob Proctor reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "there's not much wrong with this game. The subject may not be of interest to everyone but this game recreates the feel of nighttime surface combat better than any other game of any kind."<ref name="CGW34">{{cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |title=Warship |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January–February 1987 |volume=1 |issue=34 |pages=52–54}}</ref>

In a 1988 ''[[Page 6]]'' survey of wargames for Atari computers, writer M. Evan Brooks found that ''Warship''{{'}}s poor documentation limited its appeal to "to true naval aficionados and not to those with a marginal interest."<ref name=page6>{{cite journal | author=Brooks, M. Evan | title=Wargames | journal=[[Page 6]] | issue=31 | date=January–February 1988 | pages=12–16 }}</ref> In his similar 1989 computer wargame survey, J. L. Miller of ''Computer Play'' called the game "historically accurate and recommended for the naval buff."<ref name=computerplay />

==Sequel==
Gary Grigsby designed a sequel to ''Warship'' entitled ''[[Battle Cruiser (video game)|Battle Cruiser]]'' (1987), which carries over large parts of ''Warship''{{'}}s system but covers both World War II and [[World War I]].<ref name=cgwbattlecruiser>{{cite magazine | author=Proctor, Bob | title=''Battle Cruiser'' | issue=38 | date=June–July 1987 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=30, 31 }}</ref><ref name=guru />
