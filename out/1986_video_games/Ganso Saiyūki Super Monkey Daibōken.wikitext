The game is based on the novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:GSSMDSideScrollingLevel.png|175px|left|thumb|Sun must fight a crocodile-like enemy in order to progress in this level.]]

[[Sun Wukong]] must assist the Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] with his task of collecting some [[sūtra]]s as they make the treacherous voyage from [[China]] to [[India]]. Other guardians can be asked to join the adventuring party after meeting up with them. Most of the storyline in this video game is based on the Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. Players can enter a code that allows them to return to any stage at any time; similar to a [[password (video games)|password]] system.

It is possible to die of starvation and/or hunger without the proper food/drink items. A meter for water and food are automatically deducted for every move that is made while travelling from landmark to landmark. These food and drink items are found inside people's houses for consumption. Houses appears as buildings representing [[pagoda]]s. Certain landmarks must be entered in order to progress the game's storyline; these are represented in-game as a grey square with a drawbridge-like structure. An onslaught of enemies must be defeated in the side-scrolling segments of the game.

This video game was featured in the Japanese TV show ''[[Game Center CX]]''. It was declared to be one of the hardest (and least comprehensible) video games in the history of Japanese video games. It is often considered a [[kusoge]].
