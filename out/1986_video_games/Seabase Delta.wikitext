== Reception ==
''[[Sinclair User]]'': "The text itself is at a fairly basic level but the structure of the base, the travel system and the many messages and objects provide an atmosphere in their own right. The jokey approach also helps to keep your spirits up and you will find yourself quickly caught up in the game."<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{Citation|title=Seabase Delta Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=July 1986}}</ref>

''ZX Computing'': "The game has some fairly attractive fullscreen graphics... reasonably descriptive, though not [[Booker Prize]] winning, text... EXAMINE is particularly responsive, and often gives somewhat blatant clues ... Generally, though, good fun to play..."<ref name="ZX Computing Review">{{Citation|title=Seabase Delta Review|newspaper=[[ZX Computing]]|date=August 1986}}</ref>
