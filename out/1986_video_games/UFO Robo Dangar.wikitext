==Reception==
Malc of ''Shmups'' rated the game ten out of ten, calling it his favourite [[shoot 'em up]]. He praised the gameplay for "sheer playability" while stating the graphics are "quite average and functional" and the music has an "arcadey melody over a heavy [[techno]] drum beat" that sounds strange yet pleasing at the same time.<ref>{{cite web |author=Malc |title=UFO Robo Dangar |url=http://www.shmups.com/reviews/dangar/index.html |website=Shmups |year=2003 |access-date=15 July 2023}}</ref>
