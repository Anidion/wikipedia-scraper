In 1986, SSI published the next part of the ''[[Phantasie (series)|Phantasie]]'' series, ''Phantasie II''.<ref>{{cite web | first=Matt | last=Barton | date=2007-02-23 | work=The History of Computer Role-Playing Games | title=Part 2: The Golden Age (1985-1993) | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070223b/barton_03.shtml | publisher=[[Gamasutra]] | accessdate=2009-03-26 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312012343/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070223b/barton_03.shtml | archivedate=2009-03-12}}</ref> Again, the Dark Lord Nikademus was the nemesis. This time Nikademus had fashioned an evil orb, and with it he cast a curse on a beautiful island named Ferronrah and enslaved its people. The player's mission was to find and destroy the orb.

''Phantasie II'' used the same graphics and fighting as the original ''Phantasie'' game, with one improvement to combat: the ability of any character class to target any enemy rank with a thrown rock. There were improvements in the complexity of quests, but little was done to innovate the series. One option which endeared many veterans was the ability to transfer characters from ''Phantasie I'' to this sequel.

The manual included in ''Phantasie II'' was identical to the one included with ''Phantasie'', plus a small card explaining the differences. ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' noted this was advantageous in terms of how players of the original would have an easier time getting into the game, but disadvantageous as to some particularly tedious mechanisms of both games, particularly "the infamous Distribution and Selling rigamarole". The review continued to note that characters imported from the original have their equipment removed as well as most of their gold and experience, affording only a slight [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] over newly created characters.<ref name = "CGW">{{Cite news | date = August 1986 | author = Scorpia | authorlink=Scorpia (journalist) | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Phantasie II | pages = 15–19}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Phantasie II'' sold 30,100 copies.<ref name="maher20160318">{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2016/03/opening-the-gold-box-part-3-from-tabletop-to-desktop/ | title=Opening the Gold Box, Part 3: From Tabletop to Desktop | publisher=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2016-03-18 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' in 1986 recommended it to those seeking a more traditional role-playing game than SSI's ''Rings of Zilfin'' or who enjoyed ''Phantasie''.<ref name="trunzo198608">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-08-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_075_1986_Aug#page/n61/mode/2up | title=Three Fantasy Games For Commodore And Apple | work=Compute! | date=August 1986 | accessdate=9 November 2013 | author=Trunzo, James V. | pages=60}}</ref> [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] criticized ''Phantasie II'' for not changing its predecessor's "infamous Distribution and Selling rigamarole", including a bug with the handling of money. The magazine concluded that "although flawed in certain aspects, ''Phantasie II'' is an interesting, and overall good, game of the RPG type" and recommended it to fans of the first game.<ref name="scorpia198608">{{cite magazine | title=Phantasie II | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1986 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&pub=2&id=30 | accessdate=1 November 2013 | author=Scorpia | authorlink=Scorpia (journalist) | pages=16}}</ref><ref name="scorpia199110">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 | title=C*R*P*G*S / Computer Role-Playing Game Survey | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Scorpia | authorlink=Scorpia (journalist) | pages=16}}</ref><ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | accessdate=25 March 2016 | author=Scorpia | authorlink=Scorpia (journalist) | pages=34–50}}</ref> Reviewing the [[Atari ST]] version, ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' in 1987 liked the lack of disk-based [[copy protection]] and [[permadeath]].
