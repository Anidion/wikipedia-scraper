'''''Radical Castle''''' is a [[Graphic adventure game#Point-and-click adventure games|point-and-click adventure game]] released for [[Macintosh]] in 1986, developed in [[World Builder]] and distributed as [[shareware]] by Christopher Kent Wigginton.<ref name="macuser" />

Players assume the role of the 'Squire', who after mistaking the princess for a serving wench, is given a choice by the King between death and a quest to recover an oracle stolen by a wizard. At one point of the game an area identical to the opening screen of ''[[Enchanted Scepters]]'' is shown; if the player chooses to go forward a prompt is given encouraging the player to purchase ''Enchanted Scepters'' from [[Silicon Beach Software]].

The game was distributed on magazine shareware collection disks, [[Macintosh User Group|Macintosh user group]] mail-outs, and pre-Internet online services. Gaming historian Richard Moss described it as a standout amongst early World Builder games, popular with players due to its [[Monty Python]]-esque humor.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Secret History of Mac Gaming |chapter=Game Development for The Rest of Us |last=Moss |first=Richard |page=38 |isbn=978-1-78352-487-7 |date=2018 |publisher=[[Unbound (publisher)|Unbound]] }}</ref>
