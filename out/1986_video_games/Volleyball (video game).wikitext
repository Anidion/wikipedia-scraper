== Development ==
''Volleyball'' is based on an arcade game, developed by Pax Soft Nica and Nintendo R&D1 and published by Nintendo. It was released in March 1987.<ref name=allgame/>

== Reception ==
Christopher Michael Baker of ''AllGame'' rated the game two out of five and said that it showed the developer's inexperience at creating volleyball games. He could not figure out which character he controlled at any given point nor the ball's location as poorly anticipated by its shadow. He criticized the "annoying" sound effects. He said that Nintendo had made games for all other sports and likely was obliged to make a volleyball game. He ultimately recommended ''[[Kings of the Beach]]'' and ''[[Super Spike V'Ball]]'' instead.<ref name=allgame/>

Lucas M. Thomas of ''IGN'' said that ''Volleyball'' could be Nintendo's worst sports game, worse than even ''[[NES Soccer]]''. He said the controls were automatically frustrating.<ref name=ign>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/16/volleyball-review|title=Volleyball Review|first=Lucas M.|last=Thomas|date=November 15, 2007|publisher=}}</ref>
