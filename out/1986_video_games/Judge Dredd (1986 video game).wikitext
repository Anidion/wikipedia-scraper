'''''Judge Dredd''''' is a [[platform game|platform]] [[shoot 'em up]] video game based on the [[Judge Dredd|character of the same name]]. It was developed by [[Beam Software]] and published by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]]. It was released in Europe in 1986, for [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. 

==Gameplay==
''Judge Dredd'' is a [[platform game|platform]] [[shoot 'em up]] game set in the fictional [[Mega-City One]]. Playing as [[Judge Dredd]], the player's goal is to apprehend or kill criminals known as "perps." The player begins with a map that highlights various crimes occurring throughout the city. After choosing a crime location, the player goes there to stop the perp. The player has three options for dealing with perps: "Halt", in which Judge Dredd orders the perp to stop; "Warn", in which he fires a warning shot; and "Kill", in which he chooses to shoot and kill the perp. The player's weapon is Judge Dredd's [[Lawgiver (Judge Dredd)|Lawgiver]] gun, which can shoot six different bullet types. A panel at the bottom of the screen indicates the type of crime, the perp's whereabouts, and weapon information such as the selected gun and the amount of ammunition. If more than eight crimes are occurring throughout the city, the player loses. Aside from perps, other enemies throughout the game include robot dogs.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=ZXC/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=SU/> The [[ZX Spectrum]] version does not feature music.<ref name=Crash/>

Some critics perceived the game as a disappointment considering the Judge Dredd licence,<ref name=Crash/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=CU/> although the ZX Spectrum version was generally well received.<ref name=SU/><ref name=YS/><ref name=ZXC>{{cite magazine |date=May 1987 |title=Judge Dredd |magazine=ZX Computing |location=United Kingdom |page=39}}</ref> Mike Pattenden of ''[[Commodore User]]'' considered the gameplay repetitive and wrote that the game's major problem "is that you run around pretty aimlessly. The crimes and their perps are rather unexciting. An arson attack for example never seems to be accompanied by any actual evidence of fire or smoke whatsoever."<ref name=CU/>

''ZX Computing'' wrote that the game "captures the atmosphere of crime fighting in the future although it has strayed from the comic character which will no doubt annoy the connoisseurs. The rest of us will love it."<ref name=ZXC/> Jim Douglas of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' praised the game as a good use of the Judge Dredd licence.<ref name=SU/> Mike Roberts of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' had mixed feelings, writing that the game suffered from having "a nodding deference to Judge Dredd which restricted the gameplay slightly," but that it also failed by "not being accurate enough to the character."<ref name=CG/> Roberts also opined that the game felt rushed and unfinished.<ref name=CG/>

The graphics received a mixed reception, with reviewers for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' and ''[[Zzap!64]]'' writing negatively.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=Zap/> Phil South of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' praised the game and its graphics.<ref name=YS/> Pattenden wrote that "there's some nice graphics and touches but no absorbing gameplay to go with it."<ref name=CU/> Roberts praised the background graphics.<ref name=CG/> Some reviewers disliked the music used in the C64 version,<ref name=Zap/><ref name=CU/> and ''Crash'' was critical of the ZX Spectrum version for its lack of music.<ref name=Crash/> Manfred Kleimann, writing for the German magazine ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'', praised the graphics and sound of the C64 version.<ref name=ASM>{{cite magazine |last=Kleimann |first=Manfred |date=February 1987 |title=Der Richter und sein Henker |magazine=Aktueller Software Markt |location=Germany |language=de |pages=34–35}}</ref>

Graeme Mason of [[Eurogamer]] wrote in 2017 that "there wasn't much for fans of the comic strip to sink their teeth into, and the game inevitably felt rushed, with jerky controls and a half-arsed attempt to bring comic-book stylings to the screen."<ref>{{cite web |last=Mason |first=Graeme |title=A brief history of 2000AD's 8-bit games |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-11-19-a-brief-history-of-2000ads-8-bit-games |website=Eurogamer |access-date=5 November 2019 |date=19 November 2017}}</ref>
