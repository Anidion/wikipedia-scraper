{{nihongo foot|'''''Thunder Ceptor'''''|サンダーセプター|Sandā Seputā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 3D [[rail shooter]] arcade game that was released by [[Namco]] in 1986. It usurped both ''[[Libble Rabble]]'' and ''[[Toy Pop]]'' (the latter of which was released earlier in 1986) as the company's most powerful [[8-bit]] arcade games, was the first game from them to use an analogue (360-degree) joystick. A [[Stereoscopic video game|stereoscopic 3-D]] sequel, ''3-D Thunder Ceptor II'', was released towards the end of the year.

==Gameplay==

The player must take control of the eponymous Thunder Ceptor, a hyper-way fighter ship developed by the Federal Troops, which is equipped with a rapid-fire zapper cannon, and rocket artillery napalm bombs – it can possess up to five of these bombs at a time, and they will be replenished at the end of each command. It also has a radar (which is displayed in the centre of the screen), and its progress ("WAY") is displayed up at the top of the screen, along with its energy ("POWER") and its bomb ("ARMS"). Its condition is also displayed in the top-left corner of the screen (usually with an image of its blueprints), but shall change to say "CAUTION" or "ENERGY EMPTY" when a formation attack is heading towards it or it is reduced to four bars of power.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Development and release==
''Thunder Ceptor'' was Namco's answer to ''[[Space Harrier]]'', a similar arcade game published by rival [[Sega]] in 1985. It was one of Namco's most-powerful arcade games, posing custom DAC chips and a 12.2&nbsp;MHz 68000 processor, the same one used in consoles like the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The graphics were designed by Shigeki Toyama, an artist known for his work on games such as ''[[Xevious]]'', ''[[Point Blank (video game series)|Point Blank]]'', and ''[[Galaxian3: Project Dragoon]]''.<ref name="STGv0"/> Toyama made the graphics through a then-new pixel art program on a consumer-grade computer, which was written in [[BASIC]].<ref name="STGv0"/> He also designed the arcade cabinet, which was a sit-down with a [[Yoke (aeronautics)|yoke]] controller and an accelerator pad.<ref name="STGv0">{{cite magazine|title=NamcoアーケードSTG特集 Arrangement: Special Interview - 遠山茂樹氏 (Shigeki Tooyama)|magazine=Shooting Gameside|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=30 November 2011|pages=68–71|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896373783}} ([http://shmuplations.com/shigekitoyama/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230192303/http://shmuplations.com/shigekitoyama/|date=2019-12-30}}).</ref> The game was published in July 1986.<ref>{{cite book|last=Akagi|first=Masumi|url=https://archive.org/stream/ArcadeGameList1971-2005#page/n53/mode/1up|title=ナムコ Namco|work=アーケードTVゲームリスト 国内•海外編 (1971-2005)|edition=1st|publisher=Amusement News Agency|date=13 October 2006|page=52|isbn=978-4990251215|language=ja}}</ref>

==Reception==
In Japan, the arcade trade publication ''Game Machine'' listed ''Thunder Ceptor'' as being the fourth most popular arcade game of [[1986 in video games|August 1986]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=290|publisher=Amusement Press |date=15 August 1986|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>

Retrospectively in 2013, Corwin Brence of ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' described its gameplay as a combination of ''[[Xevious]]'' and ''[[Pole Position]]'', and said it made for a unique 3D shooting game. While he said the gameplay wasn't anything amazing, Brence commended the game for its hardware capabilities, commenting on its 3D perspective, custom chips, and multitude of on-screen sprites with little slowdown. Brence expressed disappointment that the game was never included on any Namco video game collections or received any contemporary home releases, writing that: "Namco has also not bothered to include ''Thunder Ceptor'' on any of its ''[[Namco Museum]]'' series, deciding to focus instead on their pre-1985 hits like ''Pac-Man''. ''Thunder Ceptor'' would remain lost for the years to come, except to a curious few with an emulator and an Internet connection".<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Brence |first1=Corwin |title=Thunder Ceptor / 3-D Thunder Ceptor II |url=https://hg101.kontek.net/thunderceptor/thunderceptor.htm |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=7 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190926011244/https://hg101.kontek.net/thunderceptor/thunderceptor.htm |archive-date=26 September 2019 |date=8 July 2013}}</ref>

''[[Retro Gamer]]'', who compared it to ''[[Space Harrier]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (1983 video game)|Star Wars]]'', argued that the game had little to offer that made it stand out from other 3D shooters. They complained that the graphics looked rushed and blocky, but that the 3D perspective was unique and done well. Ultimately, they stated that ''Thunder Ceptor'' wasn't as refined as Sega and Atari's games, and recommended that readers play those instead.<ref name="RGamer">{{cite news |title=The Unconverted - Thunder Ceptor |url=https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____112/53 |access-date=7 May 2020 |agency=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=112 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507154258/https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____112/53 |archive-date=7 May 2020 |location=United Kingdom |page=53}}</ref>

The 3-D image is generated using [[LCD shutter]] glasses, which is enhanced by a [[fresnel lens]] placed between the video screen and shutter glasses, giving the impression of large 3-D images coming near the player. It followed on the heels of several stereoscopic 3-D arcade games released by rival companies [[Irem]], [[Sega]] and [[Taito]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Overseas Readers Column|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=301|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 February 1987|page=22|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19870201p.pdf#page=12}}</ref>
