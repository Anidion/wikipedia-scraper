Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the [[Atari ST]] version of the game for ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' and said: "I'd mostly recommend it for ''Boulder Dash'' fanatics who know the game inside and out and want new horizons and challenges. They certainly can be created here".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/1988-03-anticmagazine|title=Antic Magazine Volume 6 Number 11 (Next Generation Game Machines)|date=March 12, 1988|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
