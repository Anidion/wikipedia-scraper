{{Nihongo foot|'''''Metroid'''''|メトロイド|Metoroido|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[action-adventure game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]]. The first installment in the ''[[Metroid]]'' series, it was originally released in Japan for the [[Family Computer Disk System]] in August 1986. North America received a release in August 1987 on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System Game Pak|Game Pak]] [[ROM cartridge]] format, with the European release following in January 1988. Set on the planet Zebes, the story follows [[Samus Aran]] as she attempts to retrieve the parasitic [[Metroid (fictional species)|Metroid]] organisms that were stolen by [[Space Pirates (Metroid)|Space Pirates]], who plan to replicate the Metroids by exposing them to [[beta ray]]s and then use them as biological weapons to destroy Samus and all who oppose them.

The game was developed by [[Nintendo Research & Development 1]] (Nintendo R&D1) and [[Intelligent Systems]]. It was produced by [[Gunpei Yokoi]], directed by Satoru Okada and Masao Yamamoto, and scored by [[Hirokazu Tanaka]]. It pioneered the [[Metroidvania]] genre, focusing on exploration and searching for power-ups used to reach previously inaccessible areas. Its varied endings for fast completion times made it an early popular title for [[speedrun]]ning. It was also lauded for being one of the first video games to showcase a female protagonist.

''Metroid'' was both a critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised its graphics, soundtrack, and tight controls. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' ranked it 11th on their list of the best games for a [[Nintendo video game console|Nintendo console]]. On Top 100 Games lists, it was ranked 7th by ''[[Game Informer]]'' and 69th by ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''. The game has been rereleased multiple times onto other Nintendo systems, such as the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2004, the [[Wii]], [[Wii U]] and [[3DS]] via the [[Virtual Console]] service, and the [[Nintendo Switch]] via its [[Nintendo Switch Online|online service]]. An enhanced [[remake]] of ''Metroid'' featuring updated visuals and gameplay, ''[[Metroid: Zero Mission]]'', was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004.

==Gameplay==

''Metroid'' is an [[action-adventure game]] in which the player controls [[Samus Aran]] in {{failed verification span|[[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite-rendered]] [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] landscapes.|date=June 2024}}<ref name="colayco" /><ref name="Metroid instruction booklet" /><ref name="The History of Metroid, at GameSpot" /> The game takes place on the planet Zebes, a large, [[open-ended (gameplay)|open-ended]] world with areas connected by doors and elevators. The player controls Samus as she travels through the planet's caverns and hunts Space Pirates. She begins with a weak power beam as her only weapon, and with only the ability to jump. The player explores more areas and collects power-ups that grant Samus special abilities and enhance her armor and weaponry, allowing her to enter areas that were previously inaccessible. Among the power-ups that are included in the game are the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to curl into a ball to roll into tunnels; the Bomb, which can only be used while in ball form and can open hidden floor/wall paths; and the Screw Attack, a [[somersault]]ing move that destroys enemies in its path.<ref name="Metroid instruction booklet">{{cite book | title=Metroid Instruction Booklet | publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] | location=USA | year=1989 | id=NES-MT-USA-1 | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAAQE.pdf | access-date=July 4, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623230459/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAAQE.pdf | archive-date=June 23, 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="The History of Metroid, at GameSpot">{{cite web | last=Shoemaker | first=Brad | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_metroid/p2_01.html | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003050311/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_metroid/p2_01.html | archive-date=October 3, 2013 | title=The History of Metroid | page=Metroid | website=GameSpot | access-date=April 8, 2014}}</ref>

In addition to common enemies, Samus encounters two [[Boss (video games)|bosses]], Kraid and Ridley, whom she must defeat in order to progress. Ordinary enemies typically yield additional energy or ammunition when destroyed, and the player can increase Samus's carrying capacities by finding storage tanks and defeating bosses. Once Kraid and Ridley have both been defeated, the player can shoot their statues to open the path to the final area and confront the [[Mother Brain]].<ref name="Metroid instruction booklet" /><ref name="The History of Metroid, at GameSpot" />

==Plot==
{{Metroid chronology}}
In the year 20X5, the [[Space Pirate (Metroid)|Space Pirates]] attack a Galactic Federation-owned space research vessel and seize samples of [[Metroid (creature)|Metroid]] creatures—the parasitic lifeforms discovered on the planet SR388. Dangerous floating organisms, the Metroids can latch on to any organism and drain its [[life energy]] to kill it. The Space Pirates plan to replicate Metroids by exposing them to [[beta ray]]s and then using them as biological weapons to destroy all living beings that oppose them. While searching for the stolen Metroids, the Galactic Federation locates the Space Pirates' base of operations on the planet Zebes. The Federation assaults the planet, but the Pirates resist, forcing the Federation to retreat.<ref name="Metroid instruction booklet" /><ref name="The History of Metroid, at GameSpot" />

As a last resort, the Federation decides to send a lone bounty hunter to penetrate the Pirates' base and destroy [[Mother Brain]], the biomechanical life-form that controls the Space Pirates' fortress and its defenses. Considered the greatest of all bounty hunters, Samus Aran is chosen for the mission.<ref name="Metroid instruction booklet" /> Samus lands her gunship on the surface of Zebes and explores the planet, traveling through the planet's caverns, finding upgrades like missiles, energy tanks, the morph ball, bombs, screw attack (lightning ball), and ice beam, and uses these weapons to dispatch the alien creatures who get in her way. She comes across [[Characters in the Metroid series#Kraid|Kraid]], an ally of the Space Pirates, and [[Ridley (Metroid)|Ridley]], the Space Pirates' commander, and defeats them both. Eventually, Samus kills the Metroids, and finds and destroys Mother Brain.<ref name="The History of Metroid, at GameSpot" /> A timed bomb goes off to destroy the lair and Samus is able to escape before it explodes.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Metroid |developer=[[Nintendo R&D1]] |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |date=August 15, 1987 |platform=[[Nintendo Entertainment System]] |level=Tourian}}</ref>

==Development==

After [[Nintendo]]'s release of commercially successful [[Platform game|platforming games]] in the 1980s, including ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' (1981), ''[[Ice Climber]]'' (1985), ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985), and the critically acclaimed [[adventure game]] ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986), the company began work on an [[action game]].<ref name=gt /> The word "Metroid" is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "metro" and "android".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Episode 10 |episode-link=GameCenter CX#1st Season |series=[[GameCenter CX]] |network=[[Fuji TV]] |airdate=2003}}</ref><ref name="staff" /> It was co-developed by Nintendo's [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Research and Development 1]] division and [[Intelligent Systems]], and produced by [[Gunpei Yokoi]].<ref name="r&d1">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0303/4/index.html |script-title=ja:「メトロイド」に託す思い 坂本賀勇インタビュー |date=March 2003 |work=ニンテンドウオンラインマガジン（No.56） |publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd. |access-date=August 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307021506/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0303/4/index.html |archive-date=March 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name="intelsys">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4333/the_elegance_of_metroid_yoshio_.php |title=The Elegance Of ''Metroid'': Yoshio Sakamoto Speaks |author=Christian Nutt |date=April 23, 2010 |work=Gamasutra |publisher=United Business Media |access-date=August 5, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512151501/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4333/the_elegance_of_metroid_yoshio_.php |archive-date=May 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name="staff" /> ''Metroid'' was directed by Satoru Okada and Masao Yamamoto (credited as "Yamamoto"), and featured music written by [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] (credited as "Hip Tanaka").<ref name="staff">{{cite video game |title=Metroid |developer=[[Nintendo R&D1]] |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |date=August 15, 1987 |scene=Staff credits}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0411/interview/index.html |title=Nintendo Online Magazine No. 76 – Nintendo DS 開発者インタビュー |language=ja |date=November 2004 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |access-date=June 21, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210135133/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0411/interview/index.html |archive-date=December 10, 2011}}</ref> The scenario was created by [[Makoto Kano (video game designer)|Makoto Kano]] (credited with his last name), and character design was done by [[Hiroji Kiyotake]] (credited with his last name), Hirofumi Matsuoka (credited as "New Matsuoka"), and [[Yoshio Sakamoto]] (credited as "Shikamoto").<ref name="staff" /> The character design for Samus Aran was created by Kiyotake.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Nintendo Dream]] |script-title=ja:やればやるほどディスクシステムインタビュー(前編) |pages=96–103 |date=August 6, 2004 |issue=118 |language=ja |publisher=Mainichi Communications}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.nintendo.com/GDC2010/downloads/bio_yoshiosakamoto.zip |title=Yoshio Sakamoto bio |date=March 2010 |work=GDC 2010 Online Press Kit |publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. |access-date=August 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rmqi4tPr?url=http://press.nintendo.com/GDC2010/downloads/bio_yoshiosakamoto.zip |archive-date=August 6, 2010}}</ref>

The production was described as a "very free working environment" by Tanaka, who stated that, though being the composer, he also gave input for the graphics and helped name areas. Partway through development, one of the developers asked the others, "Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?" This idea was incorporated into the game, though the English-language instruction manual for the game uses only the pronoun "he" in reference to Samus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/488/488084p3.html |title=Metroid: Zero Mission director roundtable |website=IGN |date=January 30, 2004 |access-date=February 20, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324184655/http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/488/488084p3.html |archive-date=March 24, 2008}}</ref> [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1979 horror film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' was described by Sakamoto as a "huge influence" after the game's world had been created. The development staff was affected by the work of the film's creature designer [[H. R. Giger]], and found his creations to be fitting for the theme.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Making of Super Metroid |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=65 |page=60 |date=July 2009 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]}}</ref> Still, there were problems that threatened timely progress and eventually led Sakamoto to be "forcefully asked to participate" by his superiors, hoping his previous experience could help the team. Sakamoto stated he figured out a way to bypass the limited resources and time to leverage existing game media assets "to create variation and an exciting experience".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Metroid Made New|date=September 2017|magazine=Game Informer|page=61|issue=293}}</ref>

Nintendo attempted to distinguish ''Metroid'' from other games by making it a [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] [[Adventure game|adventure-based]] game, in which exploration was a crucial part of the experience. The game often requires that the player retrace steps to progress, forcing the player to scroll the screen in all directions, as with most contemporary games. ''Metroid'' is considered one of the first video games to impress a feeling of desperation and solitude on the player. Following ''The Legend of Zelda'', ''Metroid'' helped pioneer the idea of acquiring tools to strengthen characters and help progress through the game. Until then, most ability-enhancing power-ups like the Power Shot in ''[[Gauntlet (arcade game)|Gauntlet]]'' (1985) and the [[Starman (Nintendo)|Starman]] in ''Super Mario Bros.'' offer only temporary boosts to characters, and they are not required to complete the game. In ''Metroid'', however, items are permanent fixtures that lasted until the end. In particular, missiles and the ice beam are required to finish the game.<ref name=gt />

After defeating Mother Brain, the game presents one of five ending screens based on the time to completion. ''Metroid'' is one of the first games to contain multiple endings. In the third, fourth, and fifth endings, Samus Aran appears without her suit, and for the first time, reveals herself to be a woman. In Japan, the [[floppy disk|Disk Card]] media used by the [[Famicom Disk System]] allows players up to three different [[saved game]] slots in ''Metroid'', similar to ''The Legend of Zelda'' in the West. Use of an internal [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] to manage files was not fully realized in time for ''Metroid''{{'}}s international release. The Western versions of ''Metroid'' use a [[Password (video games)|password system]] that was new to the industry at the time, in which players write down a 24-letter code and re-enter it into the game when they wish to continue a previous session. Codes also allow for [[cheat code|cheats]], such as "NARPAS SWORD"<ref name=gt /> and "JUSTIN BAILEY".{{fact|date=June 2024}}

===Music===
Tanaka said he wanted to make a score that made players feel like they were encountering a "living organism" and had no distinction between music and sound effects. The only time a melodic theme is heard is when Mother Brain is defeated in order to give the victorious player [[catharsis]]. During the rest of the game, the melodies are more minimalistic, because Tanaka wanted the soundtrack to be the opposite of the "hummable" pop tunes found in other games at that time.<ref name="tanaka">{{cite interview|last=Tanaka|first=Hirokazu|interviewer-last=Brandon|interviewer-first=Alex |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20020925/brandon_01.htm |title=Shooting from the Hip: An Interview with Hip Tanaka |website=Gamasutra |date=September 25, 2002 |access-date=February 19, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321024558/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20020925/brandon_01.htm |archive-date=March 21, 2008}}</ref>

''Metroid'' received positive reviews from critics upon release. ''[[Famicom Tsūshin]]'' (''Famitsu'') magazine rated it five out of five stars in 1989.<ref name="Fam"/> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said it was a "tough" platform arcade adventure with a "very handy" password system and recommended it to "avid" arcade adventurers.<ref name="CVG"/> ''[[Game Players]]'' praised its "fast-paced" gameplay.<ref name="GP5">{{cite magazine |title=100 Guidepost: The Hot 100 |date=November 1989 |issue=5 |magazine=[[Game Players]] |pages=106–11 |publisher=Signal Research |location=United States |url=https://archive.org/details/Game_Players_Issue_05_November_1989/page/n109/mode/2up}}</ref> In ''[[Nintendo Power]]''{{'s}} From contemporary reviews, ''[[Computer Entertainer]]'' praised the graphics as "outstanding" highlighting varied enemies. and the gameplay as being "full of surprises around every corner."<ref name="CE-REV">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]]|title=Nintendo Software|date=September 1987|volume=6|issue=6|pp=10-11}}</ref> Both ''Computer and Video Games'' and ''Computer Entertainer'' complimented the ability to restart the game where they had last left off through Nintendo's new password system.<ref name="CVG"/><ref name="CE-REV" />

In 2006, ''Nintendo Power'' ranked ''Metroid''  as the 11th-best game on its list of the Top 200 Games on a [[Nintendo video game console]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=NP Top 200 |magazine=Nintendo Power |date=February 2006 |pages=58–66 |issue=200}}</ref> Two years later, the magazine named ''Metroid'' the fifth-best game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in its Best of the Best feature, describing it as a combination of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''{{'}}s platforming and ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''{{'}}s exploration and character upgrades.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=NP Best of the Best |magazine=Nintendo Power |date=August 2008 |issue=231 |pages=70–78}}</ref> The game was ranked 44th on ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s original 100 best games of all time in 1997,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=100 Best Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=130}} Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.</ref> dropped to 69th in 2001,<ref>{{cite magazine |access-date=February 22, 2009 |url=http://gamers.com/feature/egmtop100/index.jsp |title=Top 100 Games of All Time |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040619211353/http://www.gamers.com/feature/egmtop100/index.jsp |archive-date=June 19, 2004}}</ref> but was ranked 11th on its "Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time" in 2006, which ranks games on their impact at the time (whereas ''EGM''{{'}}s earlier lists rank games based on lasting appeal, with no consideration given to innovation or influence).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time |url=http://1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=9&cId=3147448 |website=1UP.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519133422/http://1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=9&cId=3147448 |archive-date=May 19, 2006}}</ref> ''[[Game Informer]]'' ranked it 6th best game of all time in 2001<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Top 100 Games of All-Time |magazine=Game Informer |date=August 2001 |issue=100 |page=34}}</ref> and 7th in 2009, saying that it "started the concept of open exploration in games".<ref name="gi_best">{{cite magazine|author=The ''Game Informer'' staff|access-date=July 9, 2010 |url=http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2009/11/16/game-informer-s-top-100-games-of-all-time-circa-issue-100.aspx?PostPageIndex=10 |title=Game Informer's Top 100 Games Of All Time (Circa Issue 100)|pages=44–79|issue=200|date=December 2009|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issn=1067-6392|oclc=27315596|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111161651/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2009/11/16/game-informer-s-top-100-games-of-all-time-circa-issue-100.aspx?PostPageIndex=10 |archive-date=November 11, 2011}}</ref> In 2004, ''Metroid'' was inducted into ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s list of the greatest games of all time.<ref name="Gamespot">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-61.html | title=The Greatest Games of All Time: ''Metroid'' | website=[[GameSpot]] | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016074430/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-61.html | archive-date=October 16, 2007}}</ref> ''[[GamesRadar]]'' ranked it the fifth best NES game ever made.

In a retrospective focusing on the entire ''[[Metroid]]'' series, ''[[GameTrailers]]'' remarked on the original game's legacy and its effect on the [[video game industry]]. They noted that ''Metroid'' launched the series with its ever-popular search and discovery gameplay. The website said that the combination of detailed [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], original map designs, and an intimidating musical score "generated an unparalleled ambience and atmosphere that trapped the viewer in an almost claustrophobic state". They noted that the Morph Ball, first introduced in ''Metroid'', "slammed an undeniable stamp of coolness on the whole experience and the franchise", and they enjoyed the end segment after defeating Mother Brain, describing the race to escape the planet Zebes as a "twist few saw coming". They said the game brought "explosive action" to the NES and a newfound respect for female protagonists.<ref name=gt /> Noting that ''Metroid'' is not the first game to offer an open world, or the first side-view platformer exploration game, or the first game to allow players to reach new areas using newly acquired items, ''[[Gamasutra]]'' praised ''Metroid'' for being perhaps the first video game to "take these different elements and rigorously mold them into a game-ruling structure".<ref>{{cite web|access-date=February 23, 2009 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1902/game_design_essentials_20_open_.php?page=3 |title=Game Design Essentials: 20 Open World Games |publisher=Gamasutra |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221042940/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1902/game_design_essentials_20_open_.php?page=3 |archive-date=December 21, 2008}}</ref>

Reviewing the original NES game, [[AllGame]] awarded ''Metroid'' with the highest rating of five stars.<ref name="allgame-review" /> The review praised the game above ''[[Metroid II: Return of Samus]]'' and ''[[Super Metroid]]'', stating that "''Metroid''{{'}}s not just a classic because of its astounding graphics, cinematic sound effects, accurate control, and fresh gameplay, but also because of its staying power".<ref name="allgame-review" /> Reviewing the ''Classic NES Series'' version of the game, ''GameSpot'' noted that eighteen years after its initial release, ''Metroid'' "just doesn't measure up to today's action adventure standards", giving the game a rating of 5.2 out of 10, for "mediocre".<ref name="colayco">{{cite web|access-date=February 23, 2009 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/classic-nes-series-metroid-review/1900-6112278/ |title=Classic NES Series: Metroid Review |publisher=GameSpot |date=November 3, 2004 |author=Colayco, Bob |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030032345/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/classic-nes-series-metroid-review/1900-6112278/ |archive-date=October 30, 2013}}</ref> For the Wii Virtual Console version, ''[[IGN]]'' commented that the game's presentation, graphics, and sound were basic, but they were still pleased with ''Metroid''{{'}}s "impressive" gameplay, rating the game 8.0 out of 10, for "great", and giving it an Editor's Choice award. The review stated that the game was "still impressive in scope" and that the price was "a deal for this adventure" while criticizing the number of times it has been re-released and noting that it takes "patience" to get past the high initial difficulty curve.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=February 23, 2009 |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/812/812613p1.html |title=Metroid Review |publisher=IGN |date=August 13, 2007 |author=Thomas, Lucas M. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220041355/http://wii.ign.com/articles/812/812613p1.html |archive-date=February 20, 2009}}</ref> In ''GameSpot''{{'}}s review of the Virtual Console version, they criticized its "frustrating room layouts" and "constantly flickering graphics". In particular, the website was disappointed that Nintendo did not make any changes to the game, specifically criticizing the lack of a save feature.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=February 23, 2009 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/metroid/reviews/metroid-review-6177706/ |title=Metroid Review |publisher=GameSpot |date=August 27, 2007 |author=Provo, Frank |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214092747/http://www.gamespot.com/metroid/reviews/metroid-review-6177706 |archive-date=December 14, 2011}}</ref>

''Metroid''{{'}}s gameplay, focusing on exploration and searching for power-ups to reach new areas, influenced other series, mostly the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3152658|title=One Girl Against the Galaxy: 20 Years of Metroid and Samus Aran |publisher=1UP.com |first=Nadia |last=Oxford |date=August 7, 2006 |access-date=February 22, 2009}}</ref> The revelation of Samus being a woman was lauded as innovative, and ''GameTrailers'' remarked that this "blew the norm of women in pieces, at a time when female video game characters were forced into the role of dutiful queen or kidnapped princess, missile-blasting the way for other characters like [[Chun-Li]] [from the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series] and [[Lara Croft]] [from the ''[[Tomb Raider (series)|Tomb Raider]]'' series]".<ref name=gt />

===Music===
In his book ''Maestro Mario: How Nintendo Transformed Videogame Music into an Art'', videogame scholar Andrew Schartmann notes the possible influence of [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s ''Alien'' score on Tanaka's music—a hypothesis supported by Sakamoto's acknowledgement of ''Alien''{{'}}s influence on the game's development. He also noted that the game emphasises on the silence to create a claustrophobic atmosphere.<ref>Schartmann, Andrew. [http://thoughtcatalog.com/book/maestro-mario-how-nintendo-transformed-videogame-music-into-an-art/ Maestro Mario: How Nintendo Transformed Videogame Music into an Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823064005/http://thoughtcatalog.com/book/maestro-mario-how-nintendo-transformed-videogame-music-into-an-art/ |date=August 23, 2013}}. New York: [[Thought Catalog]], 2013.</ref> Schartmann further argues that Tanaka's emphasis on silence was revolutionary to videogame composition:

{{Blockquote|text=Tanaka's greatest contribution to game music comes, paradoxically, in the form of silence. He was arguably the first videogame composer to emphasize the absence of sound in his music. Tanaka's score is an embodiment of isolation and atmospheric effect—one that penetrates deeply into the emotions.|author=Andrew Schartmann|title=''Maestro Mario: How Nintendo Transformed Videogame Music into an Art''|source=Thought Catalog (2013)<ref>[http://thoughtcatalog.com/book/maestro-mario-how-nintendo-transformed-videogame-music-into-an-art/ Maestro Mario: How Nintendo Transformed Videogame Music into an Art], Thought Catalog (2013)</ref>}}

This view is echoed by ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s ''History of Metroid'', which notes how the "[game's music] superbly evoked the proper feelings of solitude and loneliness one would expect while infiltrating a hostile alien planet alone".<ref name="The History of Metroid, at GameSpot"/>
