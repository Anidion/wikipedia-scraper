==Gameplay==
''Knight Rider'' is based on [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|the series]] of the same name. [[Michael Knight (Knight Rider)|Michael Knight]] and [[KITT]] learn about a terrorist plot intended to trigger [[World War III]]. The player is given a map of the United States and must choose one of several cities. Most of the game consists of driving levels in which the player travels to the selected city while avoiding enemy fire from oncoming helicopters. During a driving level, the player is given a first-person view in the driver's seat. The player can choose to play as either Knight or KITT. As Knight, the player must fire back at the helicopters, while KITT drives and avoids the enemy fire. Playing as KITT, the player can reach up to 240 miles per hour, which is faster than if KITT drives himself.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YS/>

After each driving level, the player enters an operations building with a floorplan that is viewed from an overhead perspective. Playing as Knight, the player must navigate the building while avoiding guards who patrol certain areas. At the end of each level, the player finds a clue relating to the terrorist plot. The player then selects another city and repeats the process.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YS/>

Critics considered ''Knight Rider'' to be a disappointment that was not worth the wait.<ref name=Zap/><ref name=Crash/><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Connor |first1=Pete |last2=Cooke |first2=Steve |date=December 1987 |title=Great Micro Disasters |magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=20–21}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |date=July 1988 |title=Licences: Some Hits and Misses |magazine=ACE |location=United Kingdom |page=34}}</ref> Reviewers for ''[[Zzap!64]]'' concluded, "Surely after sixteen months Ocean could have come up with something better than this."<ref name=Zap/> Tim Metcalfe of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' considered ''Knight Rider'' to be "awful", stating that it had no redeeming features.<ref name=CVG>{{cite magazine |last=Metcalfe |first=Tim |date=December 1986 |title=Knight Rider (Amstrad CPC) |magazine=Computer and Video Games |location=United Kingdom |pages=16, 56}}</ref> Jim Douglas of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' stated that the game lacked inspiration, and wrote that it was as "mediocre as the TV series from which it's taken but it doesn't qualify for so-bad-it's-good."<ref name=SU/>

''Computer Trade Weekly'' stated that the game should be avoided, calling it "an absolute waste of time."<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news |title=Rubbished |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/260266497/ |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 11, 1986 |accessdate=January 7, 2020 |via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription}}</ref> Phil South of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' stated that ''Knight Rider'' "would have been a fair effort for a budget game, but for a full price, licensed game from a major software house, it hasn't got a hope!"<ref name=YS/> Metcalfe stated that the game would be criticized even as a budget release.<ref name=CVG/>

The gameplay was variously criticized as being tedious, boring, and too easy.<ref name=Zap/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=Guardian/> South wrote that KITT "is virtually impervious" to damage and thus "you can quite happily play the game (letting KITT drive you to the next location) and do something else. I am 'playing' the game now as I'm writing this, which I guess is a sure enough sign of how involved the gameplay is."<ref name=YS/> The graphics were criticized, especially the driving levels.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=SU/> South stated that the helicopters resembled giant locusts.<ref name=YS/> Metcalfe opined that the graphics had the outdated appearance of an old [[ZX81]] driving game, while writing that the graphics "are extremely basic and uninteresting–as is the game itself."<ref name=CVG/>
