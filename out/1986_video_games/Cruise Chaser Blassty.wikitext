{{nihongo foot|'''''Cruise Chaser Blassty'''''|クルーズチェイサー ブラスティー|Kurūzu Cheisā Burasutī|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is a [[science fiction]] [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for various Japanese computers, including the [[NEC PC-8801]], [[NEC PC-9801|PC-9801]], and [[Sharp X1]]. The game featured [[mecha]] originally designed by Mika Akitaka and musical contributions by [[Nobuo Uematsu]], being the very first video game he wrote music for. The game had an unusual [[Role-playing battle systems|battle system]], which involved the player controlling a customizable mecha robot from a [[First person (video games)|first-person]] view. It followed a group of young people from Earth caught up in a war between a solar-system spanning government and a group of rebels. After release, the game's story was adapted to a manga and serialized, then released as a pair of standalone books. The manga received a sequel, though the game itself did not.

==Gameplay==
The game is played through a first-person perspective, with a role-playing [[Role-playing battle systems|battle system]] and the ability to customize the player's mecha.<ref name="Retro-3">{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers2.htm|title=Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier|page=2|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=2011-03-29}} Reprinted from {{citation|title=''[[Retro Gamer]]''|issue=67|year=2009}}.</ref> The bottom of the screen shows various gauges and power levels of the mecha's systems, while the majority of the screen shows the current view of the mecha. The player flies the mecha through space, coming across groups of enemy spaceships. Battle in these cases is handled through a series of text boxes, in which the player decides how much of their available power to spend on an attack, and then the results of the attack are displayed.<ref name="EGG"/> When the player encounters an enemy mecha instead, the main screen is split into two, with each half showing either the player or enemy mecha. The player selects their attack type via a menu, and simple animations play out on each half of the screen, one at a time, to show the attack and the results.<ref name="EGG"/>

==Plot==
The game's story focuses on a group of young people from Earth caught up in a war between a group of rebels and a government controlling the solar system. The game is set in the future, where the majority of humanity is ruled by a group, called the Commune, that lives giant space station named Ondina orbiting the Earth, which oversees the development and expansion of humanity throughout the solar system. A group of rebels called the Inverse, based on Mars, are rebelling against what they see as an oppressive government.<ref name="EGG"/> The primary weapons in the fight are space fighters called Cruise Chasers, which can transform into giant robots using the "Blassty" system; other types of space fighters are also used. The player may choose whether the Inverse or the Commune win, giving the game two different endings.

==Development==
The game was designed and written by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] and [[Kazuhiko Aoki (video game designer)|Kazuhiko Aoki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-In-Conversation-with-Takahashi-Sakaguchi/In-Conversation-with-Takahashi-Sakaguchi/1-Reunion-After-Eight-Years/1-Reunion-After-Eight-Years-211179.html|title=Iwata Asks: In Conversation with Takahashi & Sakaguchi |author=Iwata, Satoru |work=Nintendo of Europe |date=2011-01-25 |accessdate=2016-02-01}}</ref> The graphics were made by Hiromi Nakata and Bruno Miki, and the original designs for the mecha were done by Mika Akitaka.<ref name="EGG"/> The programming for the game was done by Shun Saigusa for the PC-8801 version, Makoto Wakamatsu for the PC-9801 version, and Takashi Koyama for the X1 version.
