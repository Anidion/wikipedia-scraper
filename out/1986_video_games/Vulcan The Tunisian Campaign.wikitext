H. E. Dille reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Vulcan'' is a fine game for novice and intermediate level wargarners, or anyone with a particular passion for this period. The improvements made to the operating system are logical and appreciated, although long term re-playability is still an issue. Bottom line: Nothing truly innovative, but recommended nonetheless."<ref name="CGW64">{{cite magazine |last=Dille |first=H.

Phillipa Irving concluded in ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' issue 39, "This is Spectrum wargaming at its very best; complex in operation, wide in scope, and easy to use".<ref name=irving>{{cite journal |last1=Irving |first1=Philippa |title=Vulcan |journal=Crash |date=April 1987 |issue=39 |pages=73 |url=https://archive.org/details/Crash_No._39_1987-04_Newsfield_GB/page/n71/mode/2up}}</ref>
