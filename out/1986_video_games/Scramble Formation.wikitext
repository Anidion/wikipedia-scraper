==Gameplay==
In the game, the player controls a red propeller-driven airplane, flying over the city of Tokyo.<ref>http://www.coinop.org/Game/100733/Tokio___Scramble_Formation</ref> They are able to shoot and capture other red, smaller planes, which then will follow the player in formation. The player can choose between 3 formations: the first is able to shoot both air-to-air and air-to-ground projectiles, the second only air-to-air (but on a larger area), the third only air-to-ground (but on a larger area as well). During gameplay, the player should react accordingly to the threats and quickly decide which one of the 3 formation types is more adequate at one given moment.

The game is divided in areas, depicting key places in [[Tokyo]], such as [[Shinjuku]], [[Akasaka, Tokyo|Akasaka]], and [[Ginza]]. There are no clearly defined "levels", but at some points the player is faced by a giant mothership, which can be shot down by hitting its engines.

==Ports==
A port was released for the [[MSX2]] home computer in 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesdbase.com/gamedetail-msx_2.scramble_formation.1987.taito_corporation.shooter.taito_corporation.aspx|title = Scramble Formation - MSX 2 - Games Database}}</ref>
