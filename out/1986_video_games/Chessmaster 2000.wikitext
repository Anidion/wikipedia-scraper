==Gameplay==
''Chessmaster 2000'' is a chess engine made for chess players from novice to professional skill levels. Players choose from 12 different skill levels to play against, and can have aides in game to assist them, such as hints offered by the CPU. Players could also turn the board 90 degrees in 3D. The game has documentation on famous chess matches from past tournaments, and allows players to recreate the positions from those events. Copies of the game were also bundled with an illustrated booklet from the [[United States Chess Federation|U.S. Chess Federation]], and included a discount membership to the USCF.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Chessmaster 2000 ad blurbs |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/10/the-chessmaster-2000/adblurbs/ |access-date=2024-03-14 |website=MobyGames |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Chessmaster 2000 (1986) |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/10/the-chessmaster-2000/ |access-date=2024-03-14 |website=MobyGames |language=en}}</ref>
