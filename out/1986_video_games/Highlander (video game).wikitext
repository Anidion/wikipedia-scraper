''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' gave the Spectrum version an overall score of 57%, calling its gameplay "clunky" and "trite", graphics "chunky" and 'unimpressive', and all three reviewers described ''Highlander'' as "boring", with one reviewer summarizing the game as "totally boring and quite unplayable".<ref name=crash>{{cite magazine|title =Reviews: Highlander |date =February 1987 |url =https://archive.org/details/crash-magazine-37/page/n113/mode/2up |magazine =[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |publisher =Newsfield Limited |author1=Ben|author2=Paul|author3=Mike |issue =37 |page =114}}</ref> In addition to ''[[Sinclair User]]'s'' "golden turkey" award, ''Sinclair User'' gave the Spectrum version of ''Highlander'' an overall score of two out of five stars, calling all three levels "virtually identical", and expressed that its gameplay 'lacks finesse', summarizing ''Highlander's'' gameplay as 'slamming the joystick until you win'.<ref name=user>{{cite magazine|title =Arcade Review: Highlander|date =January 1987 |url =https://archive.org/details/sinclair-user-magazine-058/page/n51/mode/2up |magazine =[[Sinclair User]] |publisher =EMAP Publications |last =Gilbert |first =John |issue =58 |page =52|issn=0262-5458}}</ref>

''Crash's'' sister magazine ''[[Zzap!64]]'' gave the Commodore 64 version an overall score of 30%, thoroughly criticizing it as "slow and boring" with "blocky" graphics and "unresponsive" controls, bluntly summarizing the game as a whole as a "film tie-in rip-off" with "nothing vaguely original or interesting".<ref name=zzap>{{cite magazine|title =Zzap!

The ZX Spectrum version of ''Highlander'' is featured in [[Stuart Ashen|Stuart Ashen's]] (also known by his online presence as Ashens) 2015 book ''Terrible Old Games You've Probably Never Heard Of'', noting that the graphics for the Spectrum release are the same as those used in the Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 releases, which are designed for a lower screen resolution and in more colors than the Spectrum. Ashens expresses that "the Spectrum's [[monochrome]] rendering leaves them an incomprehensible mess". Ashens heavily criticises its gameplay and graphics, expressing that the combat "feels futile" and stating that "on starting the game, the first thing to hit you is how incredibly ugly the characters are ... Astoundingly, it plays even worse than it looks. None of the sword fighting moves seem to do much ... you can't really tell who is successfully hitting whom ... Playing ''Highlander'' is one of the least entertaining ways you could possibly spend your time". Ashens calls ''Highlander's'' controls "horribly unresponsive" and moving the player character "clumsy", saying the single tactic to winning ''Highlander'' is to "mash the fire button and hope". Ashens calls the game design "lazy" as well, stating that "despite there being three different opponents that you have to load separately, they all have identical moves. They just look different and [have more health]", furthermore stating that the game feels like it was rushed.<ref name=ashens>{{cite book |last1=Ashen |first1=Stuart |title=Terrible Old Games You've Probably Never Heard Of |date=2015 |publisher=Unbound |location=London, England |isbn=978-1-78352-256-9 |pages=82–87 |edition=1st}}</ref>
