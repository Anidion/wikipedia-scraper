'''''10th Frame''''' is a [[ten-pin bowling]] [[simulation game]] published by [[Access Software]] in 1986. Up to eight players can take part in open bowling or a tournament. It was released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[MSX]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

The lane is viewed from behind the bowler, with the pins towards the top of the screen in a 3D perspective.<ref name="10thFrame-Zzap">{{Cite web|title = Test: Tenth Frame|url = http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=022&page=130&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap|website = ZZap! 64|access-date = February 21, 2016|date = February 1987|page = 130|series = Issue 22}}</ref>

The scorecard for the current player is displayed above the lane. The player can move left or right on the lane before starting the run-up by holding fire. A target cursor can be moved by pushing up and then moving it left or right (pressing down returned control to moving the onscreen player's position).<ref name="10thFrame-Zzap"/>

Once the fire button is held, a power meter similar to ''[[Leader Board]]''{{'}}s is used. The [[speed]] of the shot is determined by how long the button is held down. A small zone at the top determines if the player makes an error, exaggerating any spin.<ref name="10thFrame-Zzap"/>

When the meter starts to descend on the right, it is stopped in the hook zone to determine how much hook/spin is applied—from straight at the top of the zone to full hook at the bottom. Play is completed after the usual ten frames and any bonus balls.<ref name="10thFrame-Zzap"/>

Players can print out a scorecard at the end of a match.

There is a choice of three [[difficulty levels]]: Kids (in which the ball always goes straight), Amateur, and Professional.
