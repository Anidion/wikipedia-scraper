==Gameplay==
[[File:Cobra gameplay.png|left|thumb|Gameplay]]

''Cobra'' is a [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] based on the [[Cobra (1986 film)|film of the same name]].<ref name=Guardian/> The player controls Cobra, a cop who must rescue a model, Ingrid, from a villain known as the Night Slasher. The player must avoid various enemies throughout the game, including members of Night Slasher's gang, and people with bazookas. Cobra is initially unarmed and only has a [[headbutt]] as a defense. Weapons such as knives, pistols, and laser-sighted machine guns can be found inside hamburgers which are laying around in each level. The player can also duck to avoid attacks, and must jump over incoming [[Baby transport|pram]]s. Gameplay takes place across three levels: a city, a rural area, and a factory. The player ultimately faces off against the Night Slasher in the factory.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=YS/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=CU/><ref name=ZXC/>

In the [[ZX Spectrum]] version, boxing gloves located at the bottom of the screen indicate the number of lives the player has, while a duck symbol gradually depletes as the player's weapon wears out.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=YS/> In the [[Commodore 64]] version, snake heads are used to indicate the number of lives, and a hamburger icon represents the player's amount of energy.<ref name=Zap2/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=CU/>

Some critics felt that the game was lacking in originality.<ref name=YS/><ref name=CVG/><ref name=Zap/> Some compared the game to ''[[Rush'n Attack|Green Beret]]'',<ref name=YS/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=CG/> and some viewed it as a [[Send Up|send up]] of the film.<ref name=YS/><ref name=ZXC/> ''ZX Computing'' wrote that the game "stands up in its own right, perhaps because it bears so little similarity to the original film".<ref name=ZXC/> Rachael Smith of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' wrote that the game designers "haven't taken the film quite so seriously as it took itself". Smith considered it one of the best film-based games available, and wrote that it "isn't very original, but it's furious fun".<ref name=YS/> Jim Douglas of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' stated that ''Cobra'' "is just what we all expected. Not great, it's pleasant enough, and not as disastrous as most licence deals".<ref name=SU/> ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' found "few addictive qualities" in the game and stated that it "offers nothing special".<ref name=CG/>

Paul Boughton of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' considered the graphics and sound okay, but concluded "it's the sort of game you've seen many times before. It will sell on the name rather than on the originality".<ref name=CVG>{{cite magazine |last=Boughton |first=Paul |date=January 1987 |title=Cobra (ZX Spectrum) |magazine=Computer and Video Games |location=United Kingdom |pages=18, 33}}</ref> ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' praised the graphics and music,<ref name=Crash/> while reviewers for ''[[Zzap!64]]'' criticized these aspects, and concluded that it was an "unplayable, unoriginal, unprofessional, unimaginative and unacceptable licensing travesty".<ref name=Zap/> ''Computer Gamer'' described the graphics as "OK but nothing stunning", writing that the screen "can end up looking very messy".<ref name=CG/>

''ZX Computing'' described ''Cobra'' as "a very fast, very well animated game" but stated that it was difficult to master at first because of an abundance of enemies.<ref name=ZXC/> Chris Cain of ''[[Commodore User]]'' also considered the game difficult and concluded that it was "pretty boring" overall.<ref name=CU/> ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' considered the game "Professional enough in execution" and "quite fun for a short while", but stated that "whether it would hold you long enough to get your eight [[Pound sterling|quids]]' worth is another matter".<ref name=PCW>{{cite magazine |date=20 November 1986 |title=New Releases |magazine=Popular Computing Weekly |location=United Kingdom |page=53}}</ref> ''ZX Computing'' wrote that the game would appeal to arcade fans "looking for something a little bit different".<ref name=ZXC>{{cite magazine |date=March 1987 |title=Stallone Cobra |magazine=ZX Computing |location=United Kingdom |page=44}}</ref>

In 1987, it won the ''[[Newsfield]]'' award for "Best Platform Game".<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news |last=Paddon |first=Lee |title=Knuckle busting good |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/259904472/ |access-date=23 February 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=22 January 1987}}</ref> ''Zzap!64'' reviewed the game's re-release and wrote that the "unintentionally hilarious film got the game it deserved".<ref name=Zap2/> ''Your Sinclair'' also reviewed the re-release and praised the graphics, while stating that the game may not appeal to most players because of its difficulty.<ref name=YS2>{{cite magazine |date=January 1990 |title=Bargain Basement |magazine=Your Sinclair |location=United Kingdom |page=52}}</ref>
