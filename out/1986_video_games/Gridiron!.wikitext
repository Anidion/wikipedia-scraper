'''''Gridiron!''''' is a 1986 [[sports video game]] developed by [[Bethesda Softworks]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The game was the first title of [[Maryland]] studio, founded by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] graduate Christopher Weaver and lead programmer Ed Fletcher, who aimed to create a more realistic sports simulation title.

''Gridiron!'' is a game in which statistics for players are provided on an NFL DataDisc.<ref name=CGW/>

== Development and release ==

''Gridiron!'' was developed by [[Bethesda Softworks]], a [[Bethesda, Maryland|Maryland]]-based studio created by founder [[Christopher Weaver]] in 1986.<ref>Ramsay (2012) p. 281</ref> Weaver created the game with lead programmer Ed Fletcher, a colleague in Weaver's former consulting company Media Technology who suggested entering the video game market.<ref>Ramsay (2012) p. 281, 285</ref> A football game was chosen as an initial project due to Fletcher's knowledge and interest in the game, with Weaver lacking knowledge of the game but having experience with physics and display interaction as a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] science graduate.<ref>Ramsay (2012) p. 282</ref> Production was "extremely frugal" according to Weaver, with development taking place from his home in Bethesda. Developing the tools and physics engine from scratch, the developers aimed to address the problem of sports games of the time being limited in their potential to simulate reality.<ref>Ramsay (2012) p. 287</ref>

[[Electronic Arts]] entered an agreement with Bethesda Softworks to further market and distribute ''Gridiron!'' in return for developing a licensed [[John Madden]]  football title, a game that the publisher had been developing since 1984.<ref name=KT/> In 1988, Bethesda Softworks filed a $7.3 million lawsuit against the publisher on the claim that they had ceased release of ''Gridiron!'' to integrate major portions of the game into the Madden title.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Antic|volume=7|issue=5|date=September 1988|title=Late News Flashes|url=https://www.atarimagazines.com/v7n5/LateNewsFlashes.html|accessdate=31 March 2024}}</ref> An undisclosed sum was settled out of court.<ref>{{cite web|website=Polygon|title=A brief history of Bethesda’s many legal tangles|last=Campbell|first=Colin|date=28 June 2018|accessdate=31 March 2024|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/28/17511658/bethesda-lawsuits-fallout-elder-scrolls-prey}}</ref> Weaver retrospectively named the decision one of the "worst" made in his company,<ref name=WP/> considering Bethesda Softworks' contributions to its engine and technology to have "heavily influenced" its success.<ref>Ramsay (2012) p. 287</ref> [[John Madden Football (1988 video game)|John Madden Football]] was later published by Electronic Arts in 1988.

''Gridiron!'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Writing for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', Wyatt Lee wrote that the game's custom playbooks and teams provided the potential for "tremendous constructability" and the "statistics critical" design was not often observed in football simulation games.<ref name=CGW>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_42.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161353/https://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_42.pdf|last=Lee |first=Wyatt |title=The Electronic Gridiron |magazine=Computer Gaming World | archivedate=May 10, 2013| date=December 1987 |volume=1 |issue=42 |pages=17}}</ref> John Harrington of ''[[Games International]]'' considered the game to be an impressive mixture of strategy and arcade play.<ref name=GI>{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/details/GamesInternational/GI_13_FebMar_1990/page/n51/mode/2up| last = Harrington |first = John | title =Gridiron! | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 13 | pages =52–3 |date=February–March 1990}}</ref> Andy Eddy for ''Atari Explorer'' found the Atari title to be challenging and enjoyable with a "strategically accurate" design, commenting that whilst the minimal graphics assisted with seeing how formations and plays evolve, the graphics were not of a high standard.<ref name=AE/> Ervin Bobo of ''Compute!'' noted the game's customisation abilities presented "options never before seen" in a football simulation, finding the simplified graphics was "no handicap" to the gameplay.<ref name=CP>{{cite magazine|magazine=Compute!|issue=85|date=June 1987|last=Bobo|first=Ervin|pages=57|title=Gridiron!|url=https://archive.org/details/1987-06-compute-magazine/page/56}}</ref> Bob Ryan of ''Amiga World Magazine'' commended the title as an "excellent physical simulation" and the "best game" played on the Amiga, although acknowledging the "simple but not crude" graphics.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Amiga World|title=Gridiron!|last=Ryan|first=Bob|date=March 1987|pages=90|url=https://archive.org/details/amiga-world-1987-03/page/n91}}</ref> Uwe Rönitz for ''Amiga Joker'' considered the Amiga version to be appealing and playable, although noting the game took time to get used to with the difficulty "high demands" on the user.<ref name=AM/> However, Torsten Blum for ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' dismissed the Amiga version of the game as a "failed sports-strategy hybrid" and "lousy simulator", citing the lack of game options, the "spartan" graphics and "monotonous" gameplay.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Aktueller Software Markt|last=Blum|first=Torsten|pages=86|title=Certainly Not a Touchdown!|language=DE|date=January 1990|url=https://archive.org/details/asm_magazine-1990-01/page/n85}}</ref>

=== Retrospective reception ===

Several critics have retrospectively praised ''Gridiron'' for its technical innovation and subsequent influence upon the [[Madden Football]] series. Rick Maese of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the game as "unremarkable for its stone-age graphics but ahead of its time for the physics and coding that laid the technical groundwork for sports titles to follow".<ref name=WP>{{cite web|website=The Washington Post|last=Maese|first=Rick|date=9 August 2018|title=This forgotten video game helped pave the way for Madden NFL|accessdate=31 March 2024|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/08/09/this-forgotten-video-game-helped-pave-the-way-for-madden-nfl/}}</ref> Tyler Wilde of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' described the simulation mechanics as an "unheard of feat" for its time.<ref>{{cite web|website=PC Gamer|last=Wilde|first=Tyler|title=The games that defined Bethesda, from 1986 to the Microsoft acquisition|date=11 March 2021|accessdate=31 March 2024|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-important-games/}}</ref> Luke Plunkett of ''Kotaku'' similarly noted the game's simulation mechanics were "unheard of" and the first time "true physics" were integrated into sports gaming, whilst assessing the game to by "ugly" even by the standards of the time.<ref name=KT>{{cite web|website=Kotaku|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|date=3 February 2019|title=Before Elder Scrolls, Bethesda Helped Create Madden|accessdate=31 March 2024|url=https://kotaku.com/before-elder-scrolls-bethesda-helped-create-madden-5816920}}</ref>
