'''''Cyberun''''' is a [[ZX Spectrum]] [[video game]] by [[Ultimate Play the Game]] and published by [[U.S. Gold]] in 1986.  Although not part of the ''[[Jetpac|Jetman]]'' series, it has similarities to ''[[Jetpac]]'' in that the player must construct their spaceship from parts, then seek out resources and power-ups.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a spaceship trapped on a planet inhabited by hostile aliens.  The goal is to upgrade the spaceship with parts scattered around the planet and mine a valuable element called "Cybernite".<ref name="cybereview">{{cite journal|date=May 1986|title=Cyberun review|journal=Crash|publisher=Newsfield Publications|issue=28|pages=26â€“27|url=http://live.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek/magazines/crash/28#26|access-date=2019-06-28|archive-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624095636/http://live.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek/magazines/crash/28#26|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The atmosphere above ground is populated by flying aliens and clouds that drip acid, damaging the ship's shields.  The ship requires fuel to fly, and once exhausted will bounce along the ground of the planet unable to climb.  A similar enemy ship is also on the planet attempting to mine the Cybernite before the player.  Fuel can be replenished by tankers on the planet surface, but damaged shields cannot be repaired.  The player must venture into caverns below the surface in order to mine the Cybernite, which can only be done once the ship has been upgraded to include a mining laser.  Once sufficient Cybernite has been collected, the player can escape to the next planet in the Zebarema system.
