''Alex Kidd in Miracle World'' is a 2D platform game. The player must finish levels and overcome obstacles and puzzles in both scrolling and single-screen environments. Throughout the 17 stages, Alex faces many monsters and the three henchmen of [[Janken]] the Great, before facing Janken himself.<ref name="Gameplay1">{{cite web|title=Alex Kidd in Miracle World Game manual|url=http://www.smstributes.co.uk/images/db/manual_akinmiracleworldUSA.pdf|access-date=2010-07-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303053626/http://www.smstributes.co.uk/images/db/manual_akinmiracleworldUSA.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-03|url-status=live}}</ref>

Alex's punching ability is used to destroy enemies and to break rocks in order to access new paths and to collect items such as money which can then be used to purchase other items including vehicles such as motorbikes and helicopters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alex Kidd in Miracle World Review| url=http://www.smstributes.co.uk/viewuserreview.asp?gameid=6&userreviewid=5|date=2004-10-26 |author=Angel, Shadow (username)|access-date=2010-07-11| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100822203810/http://www.smstributes.co.uk/viewuserreview.asp?gameid=6&userreviewid=5| archive-date= 22 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref> At the end of many stages, Alex plays jan-ken-pon ([[rock-paper-scissors]]) with one of Janken's henchmen. Alex dies with one hit, or by losing a game of rock, paper, scissors.

The game has no save system, but by holding the directional pad up and pressing the 2 button eight times at the Game Over screen, the player will restart the level with three new lives, at a cost of 400 Baums (the in-game currency).

==Plot==
A young martial artist named Alex Kidd learns of a villain named Janken the Great who has defeated King Thunder of the city of Radaxian and who has kidnapped his son, Prince Egle (or 'Igul'), and Egle's fiancée Princess Lora. Discovering that he is the lost son of King Thunder, Alex sets out to rescue the kingdom. On his quest, he defeats Janken's henchmen and retrieves various items which lead him toward Janken whom he defeats and sees turned to stone. Alex retrieves the crown, and the people of Radaxian are restored under the newly crowned King Egle.<ref name="Plot">{{cite web |title=Alex Kidd in Miracle World - Info from the original game manual |url=http://www.smstributes.co.uk/images/db/manual_akinmiracleworldUSA.pdf |access-date=2010-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303053626/http://www.smstributes.co.uk/images/db/manual_akinmiracleworldUSA.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-03 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="giantbomb-61-9101">{{cite web|title=Alex Kidd in Miracle World (videogame)|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/alex-kidd-in-miracle-world/61-9101/|access-date=2011-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920073222/http://www.giantbomb.com/alex-kidd-in-miracle-world/61-9101/|archive-date=2011-09-20|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="captainwilliams.co.uk-alexkidd">{{cite web|title=Alex Kidd In Miracle World Story |url=http://www.captainwilliams.co.uk/sega/ms/alexkidd/alex_kidd.php |access-date=2011-09-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324014937/http://www.captainwilliams.co.uk/sega/ms/alexkidd/alex_kidd.php |archive-date=2012-03-24 }}</ref>

==Development and release==
''Alex Kidd in Miracle World'' originally began development in 1984 as a licensed tie-in game based on the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series. However, during development, the ''Dragon Ball'' license expired and Sega CEO [[Hayao Nakayama]] ordered the developers to start the game over from scratch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/02/alex_kidd_in_miracle_world_was_supposed_to_be_a_dragon_ball_game|title=Alex Kidd In Miracle World Was Supposed To Be A Dragon Ball Game|website=[[Nintendo Life]]|last=McFerran|first=Damien|date=February 28, 2018|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref>

The game was originally only available as a [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] but was later built into many editions of both the Master System and the Master System II power base, enabling play without the use of a game cartridge. From 1990 onwards a slightly different version was integrated into the US, Australian and European versions of the Master System II and also some Australian and European versions of the original Master System. There were two differences: firstly when changing targets in the game map, Alex is shown eating [[onigiri]] in the original version (and the 2008 Wii Virtual Console port), and a hamburger in the integrated version. Secondly, the original version used button 2 to hit and button 1 to jump; these controls were inverted in the integrated version.

The game was released alongside ''[[Super Hang-On]]'' and ''[[The Revenge of Shinobi (1989 video game)|The Revenge of Shinobi]]'' as part of ''[[Sega Vintage Collection]]: Alex Kidd and Co.'', which was released for [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and [[PlayStation Network]] in May 2012. This version allows play of any region version of the game (the European version retaining a 50&nbsp;Hz framerate) and the Master System II variation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://segabits.com/blog/2012/03/23/xbla-monster-world-and-alex-kidd-vintage-collections-revealed/ |title=XBLA Monster World and Alex Kidd Vintage Collections Revealed &#124; SEGAbits |date=23 March 2012 |access-date=2012-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330094956/http://segabits.com/blog/2012/03/23/xbla-monster-world-and-alex-kidd-vintage-collections-revealed/ |archive-date=2012-03-30 |url-status=live}}</ref> The original version is included on the AtGames Sega Genesis Flashback HD compilation, a  dedicated console with games from the [[Sega Genesis]], [[Master System]], and [[Game Gear]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/13/16051258/sega-genesis-flashback-hd-review|title=Sega Genesis Flashback HD review|first=Christopher|last=Grant|date=October 13, 2017|website=Polygon}}</ref>
