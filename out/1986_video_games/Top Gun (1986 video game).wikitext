==Gameplay==
''Top Gun'' is a [[combat flight simulation game]]. The game is viewed with two vertical split screens, one for the player's fighter plane and one for an enemy plane. Both screens are viewed from within the cockpit. On each level, the player faces off against three enemy planes, one at a time. The player advances to the next level after defeating the three planes. The player can use a machine gun and missiles against enemies, who become more difficult to defeat as the game progresses. The machine gun is prone to overheating if used continually, and missiles must be locked on to a target for three seconds before they can be launched. Enemy planes also have missiles, and a single missile is fatal to both the player and the enemy plane. The player can drop a flare to distract an incoming enemy missile. An [[Flight instruments|instrument panel]] gives the player information such as altitude, speed, and machine gun temperature.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=SU/><ref name=PCW/><ref name=CG/><ref name=ZXC/>

''Top Gun'' includes a two-player mode in which both players receive three planes. Both players start with a plane each and use it in combat against the other player. If a plane is destroyed, the player uses another one. A player loses the game if all three planes are destroyed by the other player.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=SU/><ref name=PCW/><ref name=CG/><ref name=ZXC/>

Reviewers for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' were surprised by how good the game was, and they offered particular praise for the two-player mode.<ref name=Crash/> Paul Boughton of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' described the game as a "neat combination of flight simulation mixed with sky high duelling".<ref name=CVG>{{cite magazine |last=Boughton |first=Paul |date=February 1987 |title=Top Gun |magazine=Computer and Video Games |location=United Kingdom |pages=14, 18–19}}</ref> Mike Roberts of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' stated that ''Top Gun'' and ''[[Ace (video game)|Ace]]'' were the best flight games he had ever played up to that point.<ref name=CG/> John Cook of ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' concluded that the game was not a bad effort, and recommended it for people wanting a "minimalist" two-player air combat game.<ref name=PCW/> Benn Dunnington of ''[[.info (magazine)|.info]]'' called the game a simple but fun shoot 'em up.<ref name=Info/> John Gilbert of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' stated that the game lacked depth and action and said that the game is not simulation or arcade.<ref name=SU/>

Gilbert criticized the graphics, describing them as "almost non-existent", also writing that the combat takes place at night, giving Ocean an excuse for black background on both cockpit views.<ref name=SU/> Phil South of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' praised the graphics and called the game as fun<ref name=YS/> Roberts, reviewing the CPC version, wrote that the graphics are crude but completely in keeping with the style of the game. His only criticism of the game was that the game could have a realistic control of the plane.<ref name=CG/> Cook, also reviewing the CPC version, said that the keyboard controls in the two-player mode were badly laid out but it still produced fair entertainment.<ref name=PCW/> Boughton considered the gameplay enjoyable and the controls simple to use.<ref name=CVG/>

Roberts noted that the instrument panel sounded a bit cluttered, but was easy to read and the vertical split screen worked well.<ref name=CG/> Tony Hetherington of ''ZX Computing'' also found the instrument panel easy to read, and stated that the split screen displays "worked exceptionally well and made the game a lot easier than the normal horizontal display".<ref name=ZXC>{{cite magazine |last=Hetherington |first=Tony |date=April 1987 |title=Top Gun |magazine=ZX Computing |location=United Kingdom |page=53}}</ref>

Nick Roberts reviewed the ZX Spectrum re-release for ''Crash''. He described the monochrome graphics as "boring white on black" and described the sound as just a blip when firing at another plane. Roberts stated that the game was better with two players, and thought that ''Top Gun'' is more for simulation fans rather than for fans of the film.<ref name=Crash2/> ''[[Zzap!64]]'', reviewing the Commodore 64 re-release, called the gameplay simple, but noting that the graphics lacks the smoothness. The reviewer considered the game as a rental, rather than a full-priced game to buy.<ref name=Zap/>

In the US, ''Top Gun'' was a commercial hit, with sales above 500,000 units by 1989. At the time, Joyce Worley of ''[[Video Games & Computer Entertainment]]'' noted that the game was "still racking up the numbers".<ref name='vgce_dec89'>{{cite magazine |title=Mega Hits – The Best of the Best|author=Joyce Worley|magazine=Video Games & Computer Entertainment|issue=11|publisher=LFP Inc|date=December 1989|page=131|url=https://archive.org/details/video-games-computer-entertainment-issue-11-december-1989/page/n133/mode/2up|access-date=4 November 2022|quote="Thunder Mountain has another big winner in the sales sweepstakes. Over a half-million copies of Top Gun have been sold, and the simple-to-use combat flight simulator is still racking up the numbers."}}</ref>
