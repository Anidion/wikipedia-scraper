==Reception==
Ed Curtis reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "There is little question in my mind that GTP is one of the most enjoyable "conflict simulations" (read--war games) that it has been my pleasure to play in a very long time. After years of interest in the factors leading up to, and the conduct of the American Civil War, it is a very welcome addition to the growing number of games on this subject and possibly the best currently available."<ref name="CGW33">{{cite magazine |last=Curtis |first=Ed |title=Gettysburg: The Turning Point |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=December 1986 |volume=1 |issue=33 |pages=28–29, 32}}</ref>
