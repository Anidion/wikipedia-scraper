'''''Rampage''''' is a 1986 [[arcade video game]] by [[Bally Midway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9261|title=Rampage|publisher  =The International Arcade Museum|access-date =5 Oct 2013}}</ref> Inspired by [[monster films]], players control a trio of monsters: George, Lizzie, and Ralph, humans turned into creatures due to various experimental mishaps. The objective is to destroy cities and combat military forces while maintaining their health. The game is set across 128 days in cities across North America, with each cycle repeating five times. Gameplay includes destroying buildings, eating humans, and avoiding damage.

''Rampage'' spawned [[Rampage (franchise)|five sequels]] and a [[Rampage (2018 film)|film adaptation in 2018]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Rampage film review - even shallower than the arcade game |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-19-rampage-film-review-even-shallower-than-the-arcade-game |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=April 20, 2018}}</ref> [[Warner Bros.]] currently owns all rights to the property via their purchase of [[Midway Games]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brady|first=Matt|title=Warner Bros. Buys Midway Games|url=http://www.newsarama.com/3254-warner-bros-buys-midway-games.html|access-date=July 3, 2009}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Rampage_Arcade_Gameplay.png|thumb|left|From left to right are the player characters George, Lizzie, and Ralph.]]

Up to three simultaneous players control a trio of humans transformed into gigantic animalistic monsters due to various experiment-related accidents: George, who was transformed into a [[King Kong]]-like [[gorilla]] by an experimental vitamin, Lizzie, who was transformed into a [[20 Million Miles to Earth|Ymir]]-like<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i.imgur.com/GUi3LDk.png|title=Confirmation by co-creator Brian Colin}}</ref> [[reptile]] by a radioactive lake, and Ralph, who was transformed into a giant bipedal [[wolf]] by a food additive. The monsters must raze all buildings in a high-rise city to advance to the next level, eating people and destroying [[helicopter]]s, [[tank]]s, [[Taxicab|taxis]], [[police car]]s, [[boat]]s, and [[Tram|trolleys]] along the way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rampage|url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=rampage&page=detail&id=2174|work=Arcadehistory.com|access-date=6 June 2020}}</ref>

The player can climb any of the buildings, punching them to pieces and reducing them to rubble. [[Non-player character|Non-playable human characters]] within the levels can also be punched or grabbed and food items can be eaten. The player's monster receives damage from enemy bullets, sticks of dynamite, shells, punches from other monsters, and falls. Health is recovered by eating food items such as fruit, roast chicken, or soldiers. If a monster takes too much damage, it reverts into [[Nudity|naked human]] form and starts walking off the screen sideways, covering its body with its hands. In this state, players can be eaten by another monster. If the player continues, the human mutates back into the monster or (if the human walked off the screen) flies in on a [[blimp]] (but has lost their score), with a full life bar.

Smashing open windows generally reveals an item or person of interest, which may be helpful or harmful. Helpful items include food or money, while dangerous ones include bombs, [[electrical appliance]]s, and cigarettes. Some items can be both; for example, a toaster is dangerous until the toast pops up, and a photographer must be eaten quickly before he dazzles the player's monster with his flash, causing it to fall. When a civilian is present waving their hands at a window signaling for help, a player's points rapidly increase when the person is grabbed.

''Rampage'' is set over the course of 128 days in cities across North America. The game starts in [[Peoria, Illinois]] and ends in [[Plano, Illinois]].<ref name="Tribune" /> In Plano, players receive a "mega vitamin bonus" which heals all the monsters and provides a large point bonus. After this, the cycle of cities repeats five times. After 768 days, the game resets back to Day 1. As game developer Brian F Colin stated "the hardware couldn't support that much art and we never figured anyone would get through 768 levels".<ref>{{cite web | title=Brian F Colin on Twitter | url=https://twitter.com/BrianFColin/status/1076893592587825152}}</ref>

Some of the home port versions of the game start in [[San Jose, California]] and end in [[Los Angeles, California]] after going all around North America. The rampage travels through various cities across the United States, as well as two Canadian cities. Out of the 50 US states, only [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Mississippi]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Vermont]] are spared from the monster rampage.

==Development==
The game's lead designers were artist [[Brian Colin]] and programmer Jeff Nauman. Neither of them being fans of arcade games at the time, Colin conceived ''Rampage'' as a game in which there was "no wrong way to play". To this end, he wanted to eschew the common video game concepts of having a set objective, competing for a high score and dying. Artist Sharon Perry, game tester Jim Belt and composer Michael Bartlow assisted with developing the game. The game's aim of destroying skyscrapers was created because the developers could only move rectangular shapes in the background. The developers had to work within the technical limitations of the time - cities are largely identical in appearance, Ralph and George are the same character [[palette swap|palette]] and [[head swap]]ped and the dust effect from crumbling buildings conceals glitchy animation. The game's development and release languished as management was unconvinced of the game's unusual concept of casting players as city-destroying monsters, but picked up after new management was installed at the company. Post-release, additional levels were added to the game to make it more difficult.<ref name="Tribune">{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-rampage-creator-0412-story.html|title=Before the movie, 'Rampage' the video game offered destruction without death|last=Borrelli|first=Christopher|date=April 11, 2018|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tronc, Inc.}}</ref> In the opening cutscene reporting on three humans who had mutated into the monsters, Colin put pictures of himself as George, his wife Rae as Lizzy, and Nauman as Ralph.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/rampage-movie-video-game-easter-egg-creator-cameo/|title=Rampage Creator Reveals Undiscovered Game Easter Egg and Movie Cameo|date=April 9, 2018|website=MovieWeb}}</ref>

Conceiving a graphically impressive title within the technical constraints of Midway's then current arcade hardware, designer Brian Colin took inspiration from the [[monster films]] ''[[King Kong]]'' and ''[[20 Million Miles To Earth]]''. Decades after the game released, Colin addressed a popular misconception that Lizzie was based on [[Godzilla]], stating that Lizzie was actually based on the Ymir from ''20 Million Miles to Earth''; he said Godzilla would've been too large to fit into the size constraints of the game, and that he preferred [[Harryhausen]] and [[Willis O’Brien]] films over [[kaiju]] films such as ''[[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]]''.<ref name="UDD">{{cite web|url=https://upfromthedepths.net/2020/05/19/kaiju-video-games-history-of-rampage-1986/|title=KAIJU VIDEO GAMES – HISTORY OF RAMPAGE (1986)|last=Rushdy|first=Alan|work=Up From the Depths|date=May 19, 2020|access-date=May 24, 2020}}</ref>

==Release and ports==
The game was released for the arcades in 1986. Colin promoted the game via a press release sent to local media outlets in each of the towns mentioned in-game; the press release took the form of an unofficial memo from Bally/Midway that stated that their town was "slated for destruction".<ref name="Tribune" />

''Rampage'' was ported to the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Atari Lynx]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Master System]], and [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Tandy Color Computer 3]]. The Lynx version adds a fourth character: Larry, a giant [[rat]]. The NES version excludes Ralph, reducing the number of monsters to two.

The Lynx version was developed by Epyx and it was originally started off as an unrelated clone called ''Monster Demolition'', before turning it into a port of this game.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kromin |first=Igor |title=Monster Demolition - Atari Lynx {{!}} Atari Gamer |url=https://atarigamer.com/lynx/game/monsterdemolition/202036068 |access-date=2023-09-08 |website=atarigamer.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=fgasking |date=2020-07-21 |title=Monster Demolition and Impossible Mission (Atari Lynx) |url=https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/2020/07/monster-demolition-and-impossible-mission-atari-lynx/ |access-date=2023-09-08 |website=Games That Weren't |language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 1997 [[Tiger Electronics]] released a handheld LCD version of the game. In 2017, Basic Fun released a mini arcade port of the NES version of the game with Ralph added. This was #10 of their Arcade Classics line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://team1upem.com/arcade-classics-rampage-review|title=Arcade Classics: Rampage Review|date=10 December 2017|access-date=12 January 2018|archive-date=13 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113035552/http://team1upem.com/arcade-classics-rampage-review|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''Rampage'' is an unlockable in the 2015 game ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''.
 
In July 2000, [[Midway Games|Midway]] licensed ''Rampage'', along with other [[Williams Electronics]] games, to [[Macromedia Shockwave|Shockwave]] for use in an online applet to demonstrate the power of the shockwave web content platform, entitled ''Shockwave Arcade Collection''. The conversion was created by [[Digital Eclipse]]. ''Rampage'' was also ported to [[iOS]] as part of the [[Midway Games|Midway]] arcade app.

In 2018, [[Arcade1Up]] released a mini 4-foot version of the original arcade cabinet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arcade1up.com/rampage|title=Arcade 1UP: Rampage|date=10 December 2018}}</ref>

The game was a financial success in arcades, and one of the last successful titles for Bally/Midway.<ref name="Tribune" />

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' approved of the MS-DOS adaptation of ''Rampage'', especially for those with computers faster than the original [[IBM PC]] and an [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] [[video card]]. It stated that "Rampage is proof that IBM games can compete with other machines in running entertainment software".<ref name="trunzo198807">{{cite magazine | title=Stompin' On The Savoy / Activision's "Rampage" of Destruction | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=July 1988 | author=Trunzo, James V. | pages=30}}</ref>

''[[Your Sinclair]]'' said it was "all great fun for a while but being a monster can become a drag. So unless you intend to play it three-handed, when the fun factor increases a little, or you're a monster fan of the original, you might just give this a miss for something with more lasting value".<ref name=yoursinclairreview/>

===Lynx===
''CVG Magazine'' reviewed the Lynx version of the game in their March 1991 issue, giving it a score of 60% score.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=CVG Magazine |title=Bytesize Atari Lynx  |issue=112 |date=March 1991 |page=71 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-112/ |access-date=28 March 2018 }}</ref> Robert A. Jung reviewed the game which was posted to IGN Entertainment in July 1999. In his final verdict he wrote that "a lighthearted, silly game that's lots of fun for lots of players (the more the merrier)", giving a final score of 9 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/07/07/rampage |title=A lighthearted, silly game that's lots of fun for lots of players. |publisher=IGN Entertainment |author=Robert A.

==Legacy==
In 1997, ''[[Rampage World Tour]]'' was released, developed for Midway by the original designers, [[Brian Colin]] and Jeff Nauman. It was followed by the console-exclusive games  ''[[Rampage 2: Universal Tour]]'', ''[[Rampage Through Time]]'', and ''[[Rampage Puzzle Attack]]''. The last game in the series made by Midway was ''[[Rampage: Total Destruction]]''.

[[Rampage (2018 video game)|A 2018 arcade reboot]] was made by Adrenaline Amusements for Warner Bros., based on [[Rampage (2018 film)|the 2018 ''Rampage'' film]]. Initially released exclusively for [[Dave & Buster's]], it includes [[redemption game]] mechanics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/03/19/rampage-back-in-arcades-dwayne-the-rock-johnson/|title=Rampage Returning To Arcades, But Not In the Way You'd Expect|website=comicbook.com}}</ref>
