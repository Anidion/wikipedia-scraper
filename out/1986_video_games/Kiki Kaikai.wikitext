The game received a number of home [[porting|ports]], both as a stand-alone title and as part of compilations. The original arcade game was only ever released in Japan, but a [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] version called '''''Knight Boy''''' was released outside Japan.<ref name="emu">{{cite web | author=Tjaberg, Tormod | title=KiKi KaiKai / Knightboy | work=Emulation Status | url=http://emustatus.rainemu.com/games/kikikai.htm | year=2003 | access-date=2007-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003100/http://emustatus.rainemu.com/games/kikikai.htm|archive-date=2007-09-27}}</ref> ''Kiki Kaikai'' was followed by a sequel for the Super NES in 1992 known as ''[[Pocky & Rocky (video game)|Pocky & Rocky]]'' outside Japan. The series, known as ''Kiki Kaikai'' in Japan and ''[[Pocky & Rocky]]'' outside Japan, has continued since then and includes several games.

==Plot==
The game follows the adventures of "Sayo-chan", a young [[Shinto]] [[Miko|shrine maiden]] living in [[Feudal Japan]]. One night, while Sayo-chan is fanning a ceremonial fire, she is visited by the [[Seven Lucky Gods]], who warn her of a great, impending danger. Suddenly, a band of mischievous [[Yōkai|youkai]] appear and kidnap the gods, quickly retreating to a faraway mountain range. Sayo-chan, determined to help the gods, sets off on a journey across the countryside, where she confronts a number of strange creatures from [[Japanese mythology]], including [[obake]], and [[yurei]].<ref name=taitolegend2>{{cite web | author=Taito | title=Taito Legends 2 official site | work=Taito | url=http://www.taitolegends2.com/game.aspx?GID=39FC8B2D-3C52-4445-9B92-375CA3382534 | year=2006 | access-date=2007-07-02 | language=ja | archive-date=2008-04-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420071411/http://www.taitolegends2.com/game.aspx?GID=39FC8B2D-3C52-4445-9B92-375CA3382534 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:kikikaikai.gif|left|thumb|upright|Arcade gameplay]]

''Kiki Kaikai'' is an overhead multi-directional shooter game that requires the player to move in four directions through various levels while attacking harmful enemies as they approach from off screen.  As Sayo-chan, the player can attack by either throwing her special ''[[o-fuda]]'' scrolls in eight separate directions, or by swinging her purification rod directly in front of her.  These techniques can be upgraded by finding special paper slips left by defeated enemies that will either enhance their power or improve their range. Sayo can be damaged by coming in contact with an enemy, and can only be hit once before she is knocked out and must resume the level from a preset continuation point. At the end of each level, the player must face a powerful [[boss (videogame)|boss]] monster that takes several attacks to defeat and is more difficult than normal enemies.<ref name=allgame>{{cite web | author=Knight, Kyle | title=AllGame: KiKi KaiKai | work=AllGame | url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:10365 | access-date=2007-07-02 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Several hidden items can be found by attacking objects with Sayo's purification rod, and can be used to either enhance her attack or grant the player points. Once a certain number of points are gained, the player will gain another life and have an additional chance to complete a level. When all of the player's lives are exhausted, a "number match" screen appears with a random 3-[[Numerical digit|digit]] number in 50-base increments (100, 150, 200, 250, and so on). If the last three digits of the player's total score match the number displayed, (s)he is granted a free game; if not, the game ends.

The [[Family Computer Disk System]] version of ''Kiki Kaikai'' introduced a few gameplay changes over the original arcade version, including new levels and enemies, as well as limiting the number of times the player may use Sayo-chan's ranged ''o-fuda'' attack, along with a second playable character: "Miki-chan", another shrine maiden who is designated as the player two character.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Though several additional ports would be made over the years, each one would rely on the same basic game mechanics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Development==
''Kiki Kaikai'' was created in 1986 by [[Taito]] game designer Hisaya Yabusaki. Pulling inspiration from tales of Japanese mythology, as well as several top-down arcade shooters popular during the era, the game put a conventional spin on the usually technologically driven science-fiction "[[shoot 'em up]]" titles at the time.  Utilizing [[action game]] elements, the player is free to move about the screen as he/she chooses, instead of being forced forward in normal [[scrolling shooter]] fashion.  While similar to the earlier released game ''[[Commando (game)|Commando]]'' in both style and presentation,<ref name=hardcore /> ''Kiki Kaikai'' is described by Taito as a "lovely action game" offering an "exotic Asian atmosphere".<ref name=taitomobile>{{cite web | author=Taito.co.jp staff | title=Taito Mobile: KiKi KaiKai | work=Taito.co.jp | url=http://www.taito.co.jp/mobile/eng/kiki.html | year=2003 | access-date=2007-07-02 |language=ja |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622032011/http://www.taito.co.jp/mobile/eng/kiki.html |archive-date = June 22, 2007}}</ref>

Shortly after the game's debut, a bootleg version called ''Knight Boy'' was released.<ref name=emu /> This version, though not officially licensed by Taito, was an exact duplicate of ''Kiki Kaikai'' with an altered title screen, and contained no new gameplay elements or features.

===Ports===
[[Image:KiKiScreen.png|thumb|The Disk System version, ''Kiki Kaikai: Dotouhen'']]

''Kiki Kaikai'' has been [[porting|ported]] to numerous home consoles and personal computer systems since its original arcade release. The game's first home version was released for the [[MSX]]2 on February 10, 1987, with minor gameplay adjustments. Later on August 28, a version for the [[Famicom Disk System]] was released entitled ''Kiki Kaikai: Dotouhen'', which added two-player support and a new playable character, "Miki-chan". The Famicom Disk System version's packaging featured idol singer Miki Ito, who recorded a single featuring the game's title music, Sayo Carnival, which was the B-side to her single Aishu Pucelle. A [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] version was released three years later on March 27, 1990, which was largely based on the previous Disk System installment. The game made the jump from consoles on June 12, 2003, when Taito developed a [[Java (software platform)|Java]]-based version of ''Kiki Kaikai'' for [[mobile phone]]s called ''Kiki Kaikai: The Bizarre World''. This was the first port of Kiki Kaikai released overseas.<ref name=taitomobile /> A port programmed by MediaKite appeared on May 14, 2004 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based PCs,<ref name=mediakite>{{cite web | author=GMani.com staff | title=MediaKite:KiKi KaiKai | work=GMani.com | url=http://store.gmani.com/detail/mky-067/mky-067.html | year=2004 | access-date=2007-07-02 |language=ja |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070310144548/http://store.gmani.com/detail/mky-067/mky-067.html |archive-date = March 10, 2007}}</ref> and a web-based game service was launched on Taito's Japanese website later that year courtesy of EZWeb.<ref name=ezweb>{{cite web | author=Taito.co.jp staff | title=EZWeb: Games | work=Taito.co.jp | url=http://www.taito.co.jp/keitai/ezweb/42.html | year=2004 | access-date=2007-07-02 |language=ja |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311010709/http://www.taito.co.jp/keitai/ezweb/42.html |archive-date = March 11, 2007}}</ref>

''Kiki Kaikai'' was also made available along with various other classic Taito titles in a number of compilations. It would appear in the Japanese-only ''Taito Memories Vol. 1'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] on July 28, 2005,<ref name=tmv1>{{cite web | author=GameSpot staff | title=Taito Memories Vol. 1 preview | work=GameSpot | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/taitomemoriesvol1/news.html?sid=6123010&om_act=convert&om_clk=newsfeatures&tag=newsfeatures;title;1 | date=2005-04-26 | access-date=2007-07-02}}</ref> and again in ''Taito Pocket Memories'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]] in [[2006 in video gaming|2006]]. The game was ported as part of ''[[Taito Legends 2]]'' for the PlayStation 2, [[Personal computer|PC]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] released in North America in May 2007,<ref name=tl2>{{cite web | author=Gerstmann, Jeff | title=Taito Legends 2 review | work=GameSpot | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/taitolegends2/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabs&tag=tabs;reviews | date=2007-05-30 | access-date=2007-07-02}}</ref> and later in ''[[Taito Legends Power-Up]]'' for the PlayStation Portable.<ref name=tlpu>{{cite web | author=Gerstmann, Jeff | title=Taito Legends Power-Up review | work=GameSpot | url=http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/taitolegends/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review | date=2007-05-31 | access-date=2007-07-02}}</ref> The game was made available for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] through the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' by Hamster in March 2020. This latest iteration also includes both the Japanese and overseas versions.<ref>{{cite web | author=Liam Doolan | title=Hamster Adds Taito's 1986 Action Shoot 'Em Up KiKi KaiKai To The Arcade Archives | work=[[Nintendo Life]] | url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/hamster_adds_taitos_1986_action_shoot_em_up_kiki_kaikai_to_the_arcade_archives | date=2020-03-12 | access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>

==Music==
''Kiki Kaikai'''s soundtrack, composed by [[Hisayoshi Ogura]], is reflective of traditional Japanese folk music, mostly utilizing [[woodwind]] and [[string instrument]]s like the [[shamisen]] with an [[electronic music|electronic]] beat. The music was originally presented in [[mono sound|mono]] format, and was composed entirely of [[synth]]-based [[chiptune]]s, a standard audio development system for older video game hardware.  An exclusive game [[soundtrack]] was never released commercially, but all the music from the game was featured on the 1987 album ''Taito Game Music'' (catalog number 28XA-110) published by Alfa Music as a single track [[medley (music)|medley]].<ref name=tgm>{{cite web|author=Game Music Revolution staff |title=Taito Game Music (1987) |work=The Log Book |url=http://www.gmronline.com/info.asp?CatNumber=28XA-110 |year=2002 |access-date=2007-07-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182845/http://www.gmronline.com/info.asp?CatNumber=28XA-110 |archive-date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> Each song was later presented as individualized tracks on the 2002 re-release of ''Taito Game Music'' (SCDC-00156), this time published by Sci-Tron Digital Content.<ref name=tgm2>{{cite web | author=Earl | title=Taito Game Music (2002) | work=The Log Book | url=http://www.thelogbook.com/music/category/soundtracks/soundtrack-game/page/4/ | year=2002 | access-date=2007-07-02 | archive-date=2019-11-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105081932/http://www.thelogbook.com/music/category/soundtracks/soundtrack-game/page/4/ | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Kiki Kaikai'' on their November 15, 1986 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=296|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 November 1986|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref> It went on to be the tenth highest-grossing table [[1987 in video games|arcade game of 1987]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '87 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=324 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=15 January 1988 |page=20 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19880115p.pdf#page=11}}</ref>

''Kiki Kaikai'' has garnered harsh reviews long after its initial release. [[GameSpot]] considers the game one of Taito's sleepier titles, and of overall less quality than their other classic games like ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'' and ''[[Double Dragon (video game)|Double Dragon]]'' (the latter was licensed from [[Technos Japan|Technos]] for the U.S.).<ref name=tl2 /> The game's graphics, though unique at the time they were produced, did not preserve well, with [[AllGame]] remarking that "once you get over your initial amusement at the game's smiling ghosts and comical skeletons, you'll find the graphics to be dull".<ref name=allgame /> The controls were seen as simplistic, yet responsive, though each of the game's levels were found to be too monotonous.<ref name=allgame />

==Legacy==
The Taito US/Japanese [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]/Famicom and Europe-exclusive [[Master System]] versions of ''[[Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2]]'' include an island based on ''Kiki Kaikai'' as a replacement for ''Magical Island''. The Europe-exclusive [[Game Boy Color]] version of the game also includes this island as a secret island. ''[[Bubble Symphony]]'' also includes two sets of levels based on ''Kiki Kaikai''.

Like ''[[The Ninja Warriors]]'', ''Kiki Kaikai'' had been a one-off work until [[1992 in video gaming|1992]], when Taito allowed [[Natsume (company)|Natsume]] to release ''Kiki Kaikai: Nazo no Kuro Mantle'', which would be known as ''[[Pocky & Rocky (video game)|Pocky & Rocky]]'' for its international releases. Natsume would follow up with ''[[Pocky & Rocky 2]]'' (released as ''Kiki Kaikai: Tsukiyo Soushi'' in Japan), and years later would help Altron to release ''[[Pocky & Rocky with Becky]]'' (released as Kiki Kaikai Advance in Japan). A new installment, ''Pocky & Rocky Reshrined'' (which will be released as KiKi KaiKai: Kuro Mantle no Nazo in Japan), is currently in development for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]] by Tengo Project.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sal Romano|title=KiKi KaiKai: Nazo no Kuro Mantle sequel KiKi KaiKai: Kuro Mantle no Nazo announced for Switch|work=Gematsu|url=https://www.gematsu.com/2020/09/kiki-kaikai-nazo-no-kuro-mantle-sequel-kiki-kaikai-kuro-mantle-no-nazo-announced-for-switch|year=2020|access-date=2020-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sal Romano|title=Pocky & Rocky 2021 debut trailer, screenshots|work=Gematsu|url=https://www.gematsu.com/2020/09/pocky-rocky-2021-debut-trailer-screenshots|year=2020|access-date=2020-09-10}}</ref>

A modern continuation to ''Kiki Kaikai'', ''Kiki Kaikai 2'', was originally in development for the original Wii console by Starfish Entertainment and set for a 2006 release, but was canceled early in its development<ref name=kiki2>{{cite web | author=GameSpot staff | title=GameSpot: KiKi KaiKai 2 | work=GameSpot | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/kikikaikai2/index.html | year=2006 | access-date=2007-07-02}}</ref> only to reemerge as the unlicensed spiritual successor with title ''Kiki Kai World'', which later became ''[[Heavenly Guardian]]'' when published.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The protagonist of the game's design, as well as the ghost enemies, would later become heavy influences for the characters [[Reimu Hakurei]] and equivalent ghost enemies respectively in the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' games on the [[NEC PC-98|PC-98]].<ref>{{Cite AV media|title=【Vol.24】ZUNさん（ゲームクリエイター）「東方の名前の由来は？二次創作についてどう思う？いつからゲーム作ってる？仕事場どんな感じ？・・・自宅でインタビュー【CREATIVE TRAIN】」|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwmF-aHuRkE|time=6:53|language=ja|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210404122623/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92XsLXSRmU0|archive-date=April 4, 2021}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
