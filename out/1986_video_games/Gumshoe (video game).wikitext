'''''Gumshoe''''' is a [[light gun shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo VS. System|VS. System]] arcade hardware and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was released in 1986 in North America and in 1988 in Europe. Unusual for a Nintendo game, it was not released in Japan. It was designed by [[Yoshio Sakamoto]].<ref>{{cite interview|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/04/sakamoto/|title=Q&A: Metroid Creator's Early 8-Bit Days at Nintendo|last=Sakamoto|first=Yoshio|interviewer-first=Chris|interviewer-last=Kohler|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=Condé Nast|place=San Francisco|date=April 4, 2010|accessdate=October 1, 2020}}</ref>

== Plot ==
Mr. Stevenson is an ex-[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent turned [[detective]]. He receives a ransom note from a mafia boss, King Dom, who has kidnapped Stevenson's daughter, Jennifer. Stevenson must collect five "Black Panther [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamonds]]" within 24 hours in order to see his daughter again.

== Gameplay==
Mr. Stevenson walks continuously to the right and will jump if shot with the [[NES Zapper]]. The player must also shoot enemies as they appear on screen. Shooting Mr. Stevenson to make him jump will not subtract from the player's ammunition. Shooting obstacles, or an empty area, however, will subtract one bullet from the total. Grabbing red balloons will add bullets to Mr. Stevenson's arsenal.

''Gumshoe'' contains four levels, and each level includes a secret bonus area that can be accessed by attaining at least twenty balloons before passing the section of the level that transitions into the bonus area.

== Release ==
The release date changed several times. It was first scheduled for June 1986,<ref>{{cite web | author=Nintendo staff | title=NES Games | url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/gameslist/manuals/nes_games.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221005931/http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/gameslist/manuals/nes_games.pdf#page=6 | publisher=[[Nintendo]] | page=6 | archivedate=December 21, 2010 | accessdate=September 24, 2011 | url-status=dead}}</ref> was later changed to August 1986,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://retrocdn.net/File:ComputerEntertainer_US_Vol.5_06.pdf |title=Computer Entertainer: the Newsletter, September 1986|website=Retro CDN |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref> but actually released in September.<ref name="CEoctober" />

== Reception ==
In a 2015 article for ''[[Uproxx]]'', Nathan Birch ranked ''Gumshoe'' as the worst of the NES black box releases, criticizing its game mechanics and its "instant-kill pits", while calling it "one of those lousy Zapper games where you have to protect a dumbass character who trudges forward constantly, oblivious to the dangers around them."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Birch |first=Nathan |date=2015-10-18 |title=Ranking All 30 'Black Box' Nintendo Games In Honor Of The NES' 30th Birthday |url=https://uproxx.com/gaming/30-black-box-nes-games-ranked/ |access-date=2023-10-20 |website=UPROXX |language=en-US}}</ref> In 2023, Garrett Martin of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' ranked ''Gumshoe'' fourth on a list of the NES's eighteen Zapper games. Martin called ''Gumshoe'' the "weirdest" and "most fascinating" game on the list but also the most difficult, writing, "it's so hard that most will probably lose interest before finishing the first stage."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ranking Every Original NES Zapper Game |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/nintendo/best-nes-zapper-games |access-date=2023-10-20 |website=Paste Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2013, Simon Parkin of [[IGN]] included ''Gumshoe'' on a list of the ten "best, most important, most interesting or most unusual lesser-known titles" by famous video game developers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Parkin |first=Simon |date=2013-09-06 |title=Hunting Down Famous Developers' Lost Games |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/06/hunting-down-famous-developers-lost-games |access-date=2023-10-20 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref> Parkin noted that ''Gumshoe'' represented [[Yoshio Sakamoto]]'s interest in exploring "murky, foreboding scenarios" that contrasted with other Nintendo games.<ref name=":0" /> Calling it "one of the most curious genre mash-ups of the era", he wrote that the game's combination of the Zapper with platforming gameplay "demonstrates Sakamoto’s restless creativity" and considered the game notable as "an early precursor to the so-called [[Endless runner|Endless Runner]] that has found huge popularity on iOS in recent years."<ref name=":0" />
