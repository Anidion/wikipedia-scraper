{{nihongo|'''''Doraemon'''''|ドラえもん|lit. "Doraemon"}} is a 1986 [[video game]] software developed and published by [[Hudson Soft]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] exclusively in [[Japan]]. It is based on [[Fujiko F. Fujio]]'s (the pen name of [[Fujiko Fujio|Hiroshi Fujimoto]]) [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] series of [[Doraemon|the same name]], which later became an [[anime]] series and [[Asia]]n [[Media franchise|franchise]]. It was the tenth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,150,000 copies in its lifetime.<ref name="magicboxjapan">{{cite web |url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/topten2.htm |title=Japan Platinum Game Chart |publisher=The Magic Box |access-date=2009-03-13}}</ref> It is the third game created for the Doraemon license after the versions created for the [[Arcadia 2001]] and the [[Epoch Cassette Vision]]. Even though the game is completely playable by a player with no knowledge of [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ROM translator Neokid and Sky Yoshi released an English translation patch for the game but both are completely different.

==Gameplay==
In this game, Doraemon must travel through three different chapters in order to save Nobita and his friends, who have all been kidnapped. Each world is actually a different game with its own style of genre and game play system, and was designed by a different lead designer. The first chapter is an action game that takes place in a pioneer that scrolls continuously in four directions. The second chapter is a shooter game that scrolls through the evil den automatically in both horizontal and vertical directions. The third chapter is an aquatic adventure game where each screen scrolls over to the next. Each world must be completed by defeating a boss at the end. Then the player will advance to the next chapter, until all three bosses have been vanquished. Power-ups can be obtained in each chapter to increase Doraemon's strength and health meter. One power-up from the next chapter can be found in the first two chapters to give you an advantage when you finally arrive there.
