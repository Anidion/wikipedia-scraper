'''''Moonlight Madness''''' is a [[platform game]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] home computer, published in 1986 by [[Bubble Bus Software]]. The player controls a boy scout attempting to unlock a safe within a mansion to obtain pills for the mansion's owner, a [[mad scientist]], who has collapsed. This requires the player to traverse the mansion's rooms while avoiding hazards such as dangerous house servants and fatal falls.

The game was developed by John F. Cain, who had previously created ''[[Booty (video game)|Booty]]'', a popular budget game. ''Moonlight Madness'' was criticized for its price on release, £7.95 in the UK, as well its technical issues. The game's graphics, gameplay and sound were negatively rated by critics, though some reviewers were more positive over these different aspects of the game.

==Gameplay==
Players must guide a boy scout through a 23-room mansion in order to obtain 16 keys and a 4 digit combination before running out of lives. The keys unlock the ACME safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress.<ref name="pcw"/> At the start of the game the player has four lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or an enemy appearing.<ref name="comp gamer">{{cite journal | title = Reviews – Moonlight Madness| journal = [[Computer Gamer]]| issue = 20 | pages = 38| publisher = [[Argus Specialist Publications]]| date = November 1986 }}</ref><ref name="crash">{{cite journal | title = Reviews – Moonlight Madness| journal = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| issue = 33 | pages = 37, 38| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications Ltd]]| date = October 1986 }}</ref> One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; this room acts as a maze.<ref name="zx comp">{{cite journal | title = Spectrum Game Reviews – Moonlight Madness| journal = [[ZX Computing]]| pages = 38| publisher = [[Argus Specialist Publications]]| date = November 1986 }}</ref> A tune is played continuously during play,<ref name="crash"/> but can be toggled on or off by pressing the 'M' key on the keyboard.<ref name="zx comp"/>

==Plot==
The player character, a boy scout, has approached a mansion looking for work during [[The Scout Association#Fund raising|Bob a Job week]]{{Broken anchor|date=2024-04-21|bot=User:Cewbot/log/20201008/configuration|target_link=The Scout Association#Fund raising|reason= The anchor (Fund raising) [[Special:Diff/572926962|has been deleted]].}}. The door is answered by an old man wearing horn-rimmed glasses—the owner of the mansion. The man, a mad scientist, expresses surprise that the boy has managed to get past the guards and booby traps in the mansion's grounds.<ref name="zx comp"/> As the boy scout explains the reason for his visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed to unlock the ACME safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away. During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.<ref name="crash"/>

''Moonlight Madness'' received negative and mediocre ratings from reviewers, who either criticized the game overall or different aspects of it. Direct comparisons with ''Booty'' feature in many reviews. The game's price was in particular a common complaint among reviewers, who stated that it should have been a budget-priced title.<ref name="crash"/> One reviewer stated that it would have been better received as a budget title,<ref name="cvg"/> another stated "Like Booty, Moonlight Madness would be all right at budget price".<ref name="zx comp"/> ''Your Sinclair''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviewer began their piece by stating "Hmmm, don't like the title ''Moonlight Madness'' much, howzabout ''Daylight Robbery''. Catchy, ain't it?"<ref name="ys"/> ''[[Computer Gamer]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviewer stated "Had it been released on a budget label, Moonlight Madness would have been fair value for money. As it is, it is grossly overpriced."<ref name="comp gamer"/>

Reviewers highlighted technical issues in the game. The eight door maze room was thought to be a [[Bug (computing)|bug]], a software error, by two people at ''[[ZX Computing]]'' magazine. Because the game contains no reset feature they reloaded the game from cassette in order to continue playing.<ref name="zx comp"/> The player character's movements were criticised for being jerky and prone to stopping at infrequent intervals.<ref name="ys"/> One of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' magazine's staff stated that the boy scout's movement to the left was quick; "as if there's a force ten gale blowing to the left." They added "When any attempt is made to move right, all the moving characters on the screen slow right down."<ref name="crash"/> In-game objects are removed from view when either the player character or one of the mansion staff move in front of them.<ref name="ys"/> When the player redefines the game's keyboard controls, allowing them to choose which keys move the boy scout during play, the pause key and music toggle key are not included. As a result it is possible to double-up movement controls with these two functions, effectively causing the game to pause and unpause or for the music to toggle constantly as the player moves in that direction.<ref name="zx comp"/>

Reviewers' opinions on the graphics and gameplay were largely negative, while opinions on the title's music varied. The background music was described as "...the only thing that is remotely interesting about this appallingly tedious game..." by ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviewer.<ref name="pcw"/> He followed this by stating "At first it sounds all right, if a little monotonous, then it begins to grate the nerves. After a while it begins to take on all the appeal of the Chinese water torture."<ref name="pcw"/> ''Crash'' magazine's three reviewers were more positive about the music, stating "The sound is fairly well done...",<ref name="crash"/> "The title screen plays a nice tune..." and "...the game's drawing point is the sound..."<ref name="crash"/> The game's graphics were described as "fairly crude",<ref name="cvg"/> "unattractive" and "...none too exciting, consisting of colourful but flickery characters."<ref name="crash"/> One reviewer stated "The graphics are large and colourful but there is a lot of character clash..."<ref name="crash"/> Overall impressions of ''Moonlight Madness'' were negative. ''Crash'' magazine's reviewers compared the game unfavourably to ''Booty''. One expressed disappointment because of Bubble Bus' history of releasing "great arcade/adventures".<ref name="crash"/> ''Your Sinclair''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviewer stated "Maybe Bubble Bus had a touch of Moonlight Madness when it picked this one for its new release."<ref name="ys"/> The reviewer from ''ZX Computing'' stated "Keeping to the boy scout theme, be prepared before you buy this one."<ref name="zx comp"/>
