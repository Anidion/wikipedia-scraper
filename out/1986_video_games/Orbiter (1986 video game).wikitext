'''''Orbiter''''' is a 1986 video game published by [[Spectrum HoloByte]].

==Gameplay==
''Orbiter'' is a game in which the astronauts are launched into space, where they have the ability to deploy, retrieve, and repair satellites, and are also able to go on spacewalks in the Manned Maneuvering Unit in a space shuttle simulation.<ref name="CGW30"/>

==Reception==
Frank Boosman reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Orbiter'' is not a grip-the-sides-of-your-seat, sweat-running-down-your-forehead game. But if you really want to know how the Space Shuttle works or relive some of your childhood fantasies, then ''Orbiter'' is just the ticket."<ref name="CGW30">{{cite magazine |last=Boosman |first=Frank |title=Macintosh Window |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=August 1986 |volume=1 |issue=30 |pages=36â€“37}}</ref>
