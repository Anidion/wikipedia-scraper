{{Nihongo|'''''Astro Warrior'''''|アストロウォリアー|Asutoro Uoriā}} is a [[scrolling shooter|vertically scrolling shooter]] developed and manufactured by [[Sega]] for the [[Master System]] in 1986. Set in space, the player flies a spaceship shooting enemies and collecting power-ups to reach the mother ship of an invasion force. It was originally a bundled game that came with the console in Europe.

The game received positive reviews upon release, praising the graphics, weapons and large number of enemies; later retrospective reviews have been more mixed, with critics criticising the generic nature and lack of variety. The game was re-released on the ''[[Hang-On]] / Astro Warrior'' compilation in North America, and the ''Astro Warrior / [[Pit Pot]]'' compilation in Europe. In 1996, [[Tec Toy]] re-released the game in Brazil as ''Sapo Xulé: SOS Lagoa Poluída'', and based it on a Brazilian 1980s toy. This version was also released in Portugal.

==Gameplay==

The game is a top down shooter, taking place through three levels with a boss at the end of each. ''Astro Warrior'''s three levels have many different kinds of enemies that attack in various patterns. The stages have no obstacles. Power-ups can be collected by shooting targets on the ground. These include ship speed increase, a stronger laser weapon, and two ''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]''-style options. Capturing Weapons Supply Ships increases the Astoro Raider's speed and firing ability. The player starts with three lives, and if all are lost, the game is over.<ref>Manual, pp. 16,20,22</ref><ref name=Happy /> If the player dies, all power-ups are lost.<ref name=Implant />

Upon release in the late 1980s, the game received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics. British magazine ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave it an 82% score. They praised the "extra weapons and "plenty of baddies" to destroy. They said "this freebie is really neat" and is "well worth the effort to get hold of a copy" if "shoot 'em ups are tops in your" house.<ref name="CVG">{{cite journal |title=Complete Games Guide |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref> German magazine ''[[:de:Happy Computer|Happy Computer]]'' gave it a 79% score.

In the late 2000s, the game received mixed retrospective reviews from online critics. GameFreaks 365 criticised the game, citing the background, "worthless" bosses, and the game being too generic, but complimented the "nicely done" colourful presentation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Astro Warrior|url=http://gamefreaks365.com/review.php?artid=699|website=GameFreaks365|publisher=GameFreaks 365|access-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022171030/http://gamefreaks365.com/review.php?artid=699|archive-date=22 October 2006}}</ref> IMPLANTgames criticised the lack of variety, the mediocre enemies, but complimented the music.<ref name="Implant">{{cite web|title=Sega Master System Review: Astro Warrior|url=http://implantgames.com/?p=610|website=IMPLANTgames|access-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106185506/http://implantgames.com/?p=610|archive-date=6 November 2010|date=15 November 2009}}</ref>
