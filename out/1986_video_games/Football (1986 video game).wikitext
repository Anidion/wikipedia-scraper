==Reception==
Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The cleverly titled ''Football'', from subLogic, is a nice enough game. The game system is much easier to implement than many recent efforts, but the graphics are only average (detail of the field is missing)."<ref name="CGW30">{{cite magazine |last=Teverbaugh |first=Rick |title=Sports Scoreboard |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=August 1986 |volume=1 |issue=30 |pages=20â€“21}}</ref>

Roy Wagner reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "I was disappointed in seeing this game turn out to be not as good a simulation as I expected. Perhaps it was because after such great flying simulations, I expected too much when my feet were back on the ground."<ref name="CGW32">{{cite magazine |last=Wagner |first=Roy |title=Commodore Key |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=November 1986 |volume=1 |issue=32 |pages=12}}</ref>
