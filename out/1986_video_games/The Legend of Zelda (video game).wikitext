''The Legend of Zelda'' was a critical and commercial success for Nintendo.

A sequel, ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'', was first released in Japan for the Famicom Disk System less than a year after its predecessor, and numerous additional successors and spinoffs have been released in the decades since its debut.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Legend of Zelda NES.PNG|left|thumb|upright=1|Link attacking [[Octorok]] monsters with his sword in the overworld]]

''The Legend of Zelda'' incorporates elements of [[Action game|action]], [[Adventure game|adventure]], and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] genres. The player controls Link from a [[flip-screen]] [[Top-down perspective|overhead perspective]] as he travels the [[overworld]], a large outdoor map with various environments.<ref name="overworldmanual">{{cite book |title=The Legend of Zelda Instruction Booklet |publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. |page=18}}</ref> Link begins the game equipped only with a small shield, but can enter a cave and receive a sword from an old man who advises, "{{small caps|It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.}}"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Legend of Zelda Instruction Booklet |publisher=Nintendo |page=41}}</ref> Throughout the adventure, Link finds and acquires various items that increase his abilities further, including Heart Containers which increase his life meter;  magic rings which decrease the amount of damage Link takes from enemy attacks; and stronger swords which allow Link to inflict more damage to enemies. These items are mainly found in caves scattered throughout the land. Some are easily accessible, while others are hidden beneath obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Legend of Zelda Instruction Booklet |publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. |page=28}}</ref> Defeated enemies sometimes drop items including hearts, which refill the life meter, and Rupees, the in-game currency. Rupees can also be found in hidden treasure caves and are used to buy equipment, information, and ability upgrades.

Hidden in the overworld are entrances to eight large dungeons housing the pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Legend of Zelda Instruction Booklet|publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc.|pages=29–31}}</ref> Each dungeon has a unique maze-like layout of rooms connected by doors and [[secret passage]]s, often barred by [[Mob (video gaming)|monsters]] (which must be defeated) or by blocks (which must be moved to gain entrance).<ref name="dungeon manual">{{cite book|title=The Legend of Zelda Instruction Booklet|publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc.|pages=32–39}}</ref> Dungeons also contain useful items Link can add to his inventory, such as a [[boomerang]] for stunning enemies and retrieving distant items, and a magical [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] that lets Link teleport to the entrance of any dungeon he has previously cleared.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Legend of Zelda Instruction Booklet|publisher=Nintendo|pages=21–26}}</ref> Once Link has collected all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom from these dungeons, he gains access to a ninth and final dungeon in order to defeat Ganon and rescue Zelda.<ref>{{cite book|last=deWinter|first=Jennifer|title=Shigeru Miyamoto: Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=2015|page=141|isbn=978-1-6289-2386-5}}</ref> The game may be completed by traversing any given dungeon on the overworld and is largely flexible to players, although gameplay steadily increases in difficulty, and some rooms can only be passed by using items gained in previous locations. There are dungeons with secret entrances which must be uncovered while freely wandering the overworld after acquiring useful items. This freedom allows many ways of progressing through the game. It is possible to reach the final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] without receiving the normally vital sword at its outset.<ref name="rpgamer review">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/zelda/z1/reviews/z1strev1.html |title=The Legend of Zelda — Retroview |author=Andrew Long |publisher=RPGamer |access-date=1 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203057/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/zelda/z1/reviews/z1strev1.html |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref> The game world contains 600 separate scenes,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gellene |first1=Denise |title=The Joystick Lives: New Technology, Better Marketing Give Video Games a Second Life |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21593457/nintendo-report-1987-super-mario/ |access-date=13 September 2021 |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=13 June 1988 |pages=57}}</ref> with the overworld consisting of over 97 scenes and the underworld consisting of nine multi-scene labyrinths.<ref name="CE"/>

== Plot ==
=== Setting ===
{{Further|The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|label1=Fictional chronology of The Legend of Zelda}}

Within the official ''Zelda'' Chronology, ''The Legend of Zelda'' takes place in an Era called "The Era of Decline", which exists within an alternative reality. In this era, Hyrule has been reduced to a small kingdom where the residents now live in caves, setting the background for ''The Legend of Zelda''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia|publisher=Dark Horse|year=2018|isbn=978-1-50670-638-2|pages=10–11}}</ref>

=== Story ===
The story of ''The Legend of Zelda'' is described in the instruction booklet and during the short prologue which plays after the title screen: The small kingdom of [[Hyrule]] is engulfed by chaos when an army led by [[Ganon]], the prince of darkness, invades and steals the [[Triforce]] of Power, one part of a magical artifact which alone bestows great strength.<ref name="manualstory"/> In an attempt to prevent him from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, [[Princess Zelda]] splits it into eight fragments and hides them in secret underground dungeons.<ref name="manualstory" /> Before eventually being kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid [[Impa (The Legend of Zelda)|Impa]] to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom.<ref name="manualstory"/> While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, when a young boy named [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] appears and rescues her.<ref name="manualstory"/> Upon hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, with which Ganon can then be defeated.<ref name="manualstory"/>

During the course of the tale, Link locates and braves the eight underworld labyrinths, and beyond their defeated guardian monsters retrieves each fragment. With the completed Triforce of Wisdom, he is able to infiltrate Ganon's hideout in [[Death Mountain]], confronting the prince of darkness and destroying him with the Silver Arrow.<ref name="completetriforce">{{cite book |title=The Legend of Zelda Instruction Booklet |publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. |page=39}}</ref> Obtaining the Triforce of Power from Ganon's ashes, Link returns it and the restored Triforce of Wisdom to the rescued Princess Zelda, and peace returns to Hyrule.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Legend of Zelda Instruction Booklet |publisher=Nintendo |page=10}}</ref>

== Development ==
[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Disk-System.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|The game was first released in Japan as a disk for the Famicom Disk System. It was later converted to a cartridge for American release on the NES.]]

''The Legend of Zelda'' was directed and designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Takashi Tezuka]] (credited as S. Miyahon and Ten Ten respectively in the [[closing credits]]).<ref name="origin"/><ref name="credits">{{cite video game|title=The Legend of Zelda|developer=[[Nintendo|Nintendo Co., Ltd]]|publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc.|date=August 22, 1987|scene=staff credits}}</ref> Miyamoto produced the game, and Tezuka wrote the story and script.<ref name="credits"/><ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Club Nintendo]]|title=Classic: Zelda und Link|language=de|date=April 1996|page=72|publisher=[[Nintendo]]}}</ref> Much of the programming was done by Toshihiko Nakago of Nintendo's partner SRD. Keiji Terui, a screenwriter who worked on [[anime]] shows such as ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball (anime)|Dragon Ball]]'', wrote the backstory for the manual, drawing inspiration from conflicts in [[medieval Europe]].<ref name=terui/> Development began in 1984, and the game was originally intended to be a launch game for the [[Famicom Disk System]].<ref>[http://shmuplations.com/zelda/ Legend of Zelda Developer Interview with Shigeru Miyamoto], ''Legend of Zelda: Sound and Drama'', 1994</ref> The development team worked on ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' concurrently, and tried to separate their ideas: ''Super Mario Bros.'' was to be linear, where the action occurred in a strict sequence, whereas ''The Legend of Zelda'' would be the opposite.<ref name="origin"/> In ''Mario'', Miyamoto downplayed the importance of the high score in favor of simply completing the game.<ref name="gamespot history">{{cite web|last=Vestal|first=Andrew|author2=Cliff O'Neill |author3= Brad Shoemaker |date=2000-11-14|title=History of Zelda|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_zelda/index.html|access-date=2006-09-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701053427/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_zelda/|archive-date=2006-07-01}}</ref> This concept was carried over to ''The Legend of Zelda''. Miyamoto was also in charge of deciding which concepts were "''Zelda'' ideas" or "''Mario'' ideas". Contrasting with ''Mario'', ''Zelda'' was made non-linear and forced the players to think about what they should do next.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bordersdown.net/content.php/533-Shigeru-Miyamoto-Wind-Waker-Interview-2006|title=Shigeru Miyamoto Interview|date=2005-01-01|publisher=ntsc-uk|last=Bufton|first=Ben|access-date=2006-09-23}}</ref> According to Miyamoto, those in Japan were confused and had trouble finding their way through the multi-path dungeons, and in initial game designs, the player would start with the sword already in their inventory. Rather than merely simplifying matters for players, Miyamoto forced the player to listen to the old man who gives the player their sword, and encouraged interaction among people to share their ideas with each other to find the various hidden secrets, a new form of gaming communication. Relatedly, this concept turned into the root of another series to be developed many years in the future: Miyamoto said that ''Zelda'' became the inspiration for ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', a game based solely on communication.<ref>{{cite speech|last=Miyamoto|first=Shigeru|author-link=Shigeru Miyamoto|title=Creative Visions|event=[[Game Developers Conference]]|date=8 March 2007|language=ja}}</ref>

With ''The Legend of Zelda'', Miyamoto wanted to flesh out the idea of a game "world" even further, giving players a "miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer".<ref name="gamespot history"/> He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around [[Kyoto]], where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, always trying through ''Zelda'' games to impart players some sense of that limitless wonder he felt through unknown exploration.<ref name="gamespot history"/> According to Miyamoto: "When I was a child, I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this".<ref name="Sheff 51">Sheff (1993), p. 51</ref> The memory of being lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family's home in [[Sonobe, Kyoto|Sonobe]] was recreated in ''Zelda''{{'}}s labyrinthian [[Dungeon crawl|dungeons]].<ref name="Sheff 52">Sheff (1993), p. 52</ref> Tezuka wrote the setting to be a [[fairytale]] adventure, taking inspiration from fantasy books such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Club Nintendo]] |volume=1996 |issue=2 |title=Classic: Zelda und Link |trans-title= Classic: Zelda and Link |language=de |date=April 1996 |page=72 |publisher=[[Nintendo of Europe]] |quote=[The two program designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka were responsible for the game, who set themselves the goal of developing a fairytale adventure game with action elements... ...Takashi Tezuka, a great lover of fantasy novels such as Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'', wrote the script for the first two games in the ''Zelda'' series].}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 23, 2003 |title=Super Play Magazine Interviews Shigeru Miyamoto About The Legend of Zelda |magazine=[[Super Play (Sweden)]] |publisher=Hjemmet Mortensen |language= |volume=2003 |issue=4 |url=https://www.nintendoforums.com/articles/40/super-play-magazine-interviews-shigeru-miyamoto-about-zelda |access-date=April 2, 2021 |quote=All ideas for ''The Legend of Zelda'' were mine and Takashi Tezukas... ...Books, movies and our own lives.}}</ref>

The hero "Link" was so named in part to connect players inserted into this world with their interactive role, as something of a blank slate representing their individuality or methods.

[[Koji Kondo]] (credited as Konchan)<ref name="credits"/> composed the game's five music tracks. He had planned to use [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]'' as the title theme but was forced to change it late in the development cycle after learning that the copyright for the orchestral piece had not yet expired.

=== Japanese release ===
[[File:Famicom Zelda Disk.png|right|thumb|upright=1|The original floppy disk release]]

In February 1986, Nintendo released ''The Legend of Zelda'' as the launch game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]]'s new [[Family Computer Disk System|Disk System]] peripheral, joined by a re-release of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Tennis (1984 video game)|Tennis]]'', ''[[Baseball (1983 video game)|Baseball]]'', ''[[Golf (1984 video game)|Golf]]'', ''[[Soccer (1985 video game)|Soccer]]'', and ''[[Mahjong video game|Mahjong]]'' as part of the system's introduction. It made full use of Disk Card media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges, with an increased size of 128 kilobytes which would be expensive to produce on cartridge format.<ref name="gamespot history"/> Due to the still-limited amount of disk space, all of the text used in the game was from only a single syllabary known as [[katakana]], which under normal circumstances primarily relates more to foreign words which supplement those of traditional Japanese origin as with hiragana and kanji characters. Rather than [[Password (video gaming)|passwords]], rewritable disks saved players' game progress, and the extra sound channel provided by the system was utilized for certain sound effects; most notably Link's sword beam at full health, roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and those of defeated enemies. Sound effects had to be altered for the eventual cartridge release version of Zelda which used the Famicom's PCM channel.

=== American release ===
[[File:The Legend of Zelda - Golden Catridge.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1|The gold-colored cartridge]]

When [[Nintendo]] published the game in North America, the packaging design featured a small portion of the box cut away to reveal the unique gold-colored cartridge. In 1988, ''The Legend of Zelda'' sold two million copies.<ref name="Sheff 172">Sheff (1993), p. 172</ref> Nintendo of America sought to keep its strong base of fans; anyone who purchased a game and sent in a warranty card became a member of the Fun Club, whose members got a four-, eight- and eventually 32-page newsletter. Seven hundred copies of the first issue were sent out free of charge, but the number grew as the data bank of names got larger.<ref name="Sheff 178">Sheff (1987), p. 178</ref>

From the success of magazines in Japan, Nintendo knew that game tips were a valued asset. Players enjoyed the bimonthly newsletter's crossword puzzles and jokes, but game secrets were most valued. The Fun Club drew kids in by offering tips for the more complicated games, especially ''Zelda'', with its hidden rooms, secret keys and passageways.<ref name="Sheff 178" /> The mailing list grew. By early 1988, there were over 1 million Fun Club members, which led then-Nintendo of America president [[Minoru Arakawa]] to start the ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine.<ref name=autogenerated1>Sheff (1993), p. 178</ref>

Since Nintendo did not have many products, it made only a few [[Television advertisement|commercials]] a year, meaning the quality had to be phenomenal. The budget for a single commercial could reach US$5 million, easily four or five times more than most companies spend.<ref name="Sheff 188">Sheff (1993), p. 188</ref> One of the first commercials made under Bill White, director of advertising and public relations, was the market introduction for the ''Legend of Zelda'', which received a great deal of attention in the ad industry. In it, a wiry-haired, nerdy guy ([[John Kassir]]) walks through the dark making goofy noises, yelling out the names of some enemies from the game, and screaming for Zelda.<ref name="Sheff 188" />

=== Re-releases ===
''The Legend of Zelda'' was first re-released in cartridge format for the Famicom in 1994.<ref name="NinDB"/> The cartridge version slightly modified the title screen of the Disk Card version of the game, such that it displayed the number ''1'' at the end of the title. In 2001, the original game was re-released in the GameCube game ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]''. The only way to unlock the game is by using an [[Action Replay]]. An official re-release was included in 2003's ''The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition'' for the [[GameCube]],<ref name="collectors">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | date=2003-10-06 | title=True Zelda Love | website=IGN | url=http://ign.com/articles/2003/10/06/true-zelda-love | access-date=2014-08-24}}</ref> and the game was again re-released on the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2004 along with its sequel, ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|The Adventure of Link]]'', as part of the [[Classic NES Series|Famicom Mini/Classic NES Series]]. In 2006, it was released on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]], and a timed demo of the game was released for the 2008 Wii game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', available in the Vault section.

All re-releases of the game are virtually identical to the original, though the GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Virtual Console versions have been altered slightly to correct several instances of incorrect spelling from the original, most notably in the intro story.

The game was released for the [[Nintendo Switch]] as part of the ''[[Nintendo Switch Online]] - Nintendo Entertainment System'' service on September 18, 2018. A special "Living the life of luxury!" edition of the game, which grants players all equipment and extra items at the start of the game, was later added to the service on October 10. In November 2021, Nintendo released a ''Legend of Zelda'' edition of the [[Game & Watch]] console, similar to the rereleased ''Super Mario Bros.'' Game & Watch. This version includes the original ''Legend of Zelda'', as well as ''Zelda II: Adventure of Link'', and the Gameboy version of ''Link's Awakening''. The ''Zelda'' Game & Watch also includes a modified version of the Game and Watch original, ''Vermin'', with Link replacing Mr. Game and Watch.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2018/10/10/a-new-version-of-the-legend-of-zelda-just-launched-on-switch | title = A New Version of the Legend of Zelda Just Launched on Switch | date = 6 June 2023}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
''The Legend of Zelda'' is considered a spiritual forerunner of the modern action [[role-playing video game]] (RPG) genre.<ref name="rpgamer review" /> Though it is often not considered part of the [[Video game genres|genre]] since it lacked key RPG mechanics such as [[experience point]]s, it had many features in common with RPGs and served as the template for the [[action role-playing game]] genre.<ref name="gspy_zelda_influence">{{cite web | title =GameSpy's 30 Most Influential People in Gaming | publisher =[[GameSpy]] | url =http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/march02/top30/61/index3.shtm | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070610002801/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/march02/top30/61/index3.shtm | archive-date =2007-06-10 | url-status =dead | access-date = 2007-04-01}}</ref> The game's fantasy setting, musical style and action-adventure gameplay were adopted by many RPGs. Its commercial success helped lay the groundwork for involved, [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]] games in fantasy settings, such as those found in successful RPGs,<ref name="gspot_zelda">{{cite web | title=15 Most Influential Games of All Time: The Legend of Zelda | website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p9_01.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100515053341/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p9_01.html | archive-date = 2010-05-15 | access-date=2014-08-24}}</ref> including<!-- NO MORE EXAMPLES ARE NEEDED --> ''[[Crystalis]]'', ''[[Soul Blazer]]'', [[Square (video game company)|Square]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure|Seiken Densetsu]]'' series, ''[[Alundra]]'', and ''[[Brave Fencer Musashi]]''. The popularity of the game also spawned several clones trying to emulate the game.<ref>An example is a clone for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] III called "The Quest for Thelda", written by [[Eric A. Wolf]] and licensed to [[Sundog Systems]].{{cite web |date=2003-10-06 |title=Quest For Thelda |url=http://nitros9.lcurtisboyle.com/questforthelda.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414205038/http://nitros9.lcurtisboyle.com/questforthelda.html |archive-date=2008-04-14 |access-date=2008-04-02}}</ref> Despite this, Miyamoto did not consider ''Zelda'' an RPG, but classified ''Zelda'' as "a real-time adventure game"; he said he was "not interested in systems where everything in the game is decided by stats and numbers" but what's "important to me is to preserve as much of that "live" feeling as possible" which he said "[[action games]] are better suited in conveying" to players.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Future of RPGs – Developer Interviews |magazine=The Super Famicom |date=27 November 1992 |volume=3 |issue=22 |pages=89–97 |lang=ja |url=https://archive.org/details/thesuperfamicom1992no.22hq/TheSuperFamicom%201992%20No.22%20LQ/page/n92 |access-date=14 October 2021}}

''The Legend of Zelda'' spawned a solitary [[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|sequel]], many [[prequels]] and spin-offs and is one of Nintendo's most popular series. It established important characters and environments of the ''Zelda'' universe, including [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], [[Princess Zelda]], [[Ganon]], [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Impa|Impa]], and the [[Triforce]] as the power that binds [[Hyrule]] together.<ref name="gamespot history"/> The overworld theme and distinctive "secret found" jingle have appeared in nearly every subsequent ''Zelda'' game. The theme has also appeared in various other games featuring references to the ''Zelda'' series.

An arcade system board, called the Triforce, was developed jointly by Namco, Sega, and Nintendo, with the first games appearing in 2002. The name "Triforce" is a reference to Nintendo's ''The Legend of Zelda'' series of games, and symbolized the three companies' involvement in the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=545 |title=Namco Triforce Hardware |website=System16|access-date=March 31, 2016}}</ref>

''[[GameSpot]]'' featured ''The Legend of Zelda'' as one of the 15 most influential games of all time, for being an early example of [[open world]], [[nonlinear gameplay]], and for its introduction of battery backup [[Saved game|saving]] worldwide, to laying the foundations for later [[action-adventure game]]s like ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' and [[role-playing video game]]s like ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', while influencing most modern games in general.<ref name="gspot_zelda"/> In 2009, ''[[Game Informer]]'' called ''The Legend of Zelda'' "no less than the greatest game of all time" on their list of "The Top 200 Games of All Time", saying that it was "ahead of its time by years if not decades".<ref name="gi_best">{{cite magazine|author=The ''Game Informer'' staff|title=The Top 200 Games of All Time|pages=44–79|issue=200|date=December 2009|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issn=1067-6392|oclc=27315596}}</ref>

In 2011, Nintendo celebrated the game's 25th anniversary in a similar vein to the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' 25th anniversary celebration the previous year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/24424/zelda-25th-anniversary-will-be-special-nintendo/ |title=Zelda 25th anniversary will be special — Nintendo |date=8 March 2010 |work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] |access-date=9 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309190453/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/24424/zelda-25th-anniversary-will-be-special-nintendo/ |archive-date=March 9, 2011}}</ref> This celebration included a free mailout [[Club Nintendo]] offer of the ''[[Ocarina of Time]]'' soundtrack to owners of the 3DS version of that particular game, the first digital for Nintendo eShop release of ''Link's Awakening DX'', special posters that are mailed out as rewards through Club Nintendo, and a special stage inspired by the original ''Legend of Zelda'' in the video game ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS.

=== Sequels ===
There have also been a few substantially altered versions of the game that have been released as pseudo-sequels, and ''[[wikt:裏|ura]]''- or ''[[gaiden]]''-versions. As part of a promotional advertisement campaign for their {{nihongo|charumera|チャルメラ}} noodles, {{nihongo|Myojo Foods Co., Ltd.|明星食品|Myoujou Shokuhin}} released a version of the original ''The Legend of Zelda'' in 1986,<ref>Keef.

From August 6 to September 2, 1995,<ref name=kameb>{{cite web|url = http://www.f3.dion.ne.jp/~kameb/satella/st_kbn/st_kbn.htm|script-title = ja:かべ新聞ニュース閲覧室|publisher = The Satellaview History Museum|language = ja|date = 2008-02-12|last = Kameb|access-date = 2009-04-22|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110204193350/http://www.f3.dion.ne.jp/~kameb/satella/st_kbn/st_kbn.htm|archive-date = 2011-02-04}}</ref> Nintendo, in collaboration with the [[St.GIGA]] satellite radio network, began broadcasts of a substantially different version of the original ''The Hyrule Fantasy: Legend of Zelda'' for a [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] peripheral, the [[Satellaview]]—a satellite modem add-on. The game, {{nihongo||BS ゼルダの伝説|[[BS Zelda no Densetsu]]}}, was released for download in four episodic, weekly installments which were rebroadcast at least four times between the game's 1995 premiere and January 1997. ''BS Zelda'' was the first Satellaview game to feature a "[[SoundLink]]" soundtrack—a streaming audio track through which, every few minutes, players were cautioned to listen carefully as a voice actor narrator, broadcasting live from the St.GIGA studio, would give them plot and gameplay clues.<ref name="bs zelda">{{cite web | title=BS The Legend of Zelda | website=IGN | url=http://ign.com/games/bs-the-legend-of-zelda/bs-x-10808 | access-date=2014-08-24}}</ref> In addition to the SoundLink elements, ''BS Zelda'' also featured updated 16-bit graphics, a smaller overworld, and different dungeons. Link was replaced by one of the two Satellaview avatars: a boy wearing a backward baseball cap or a girl with red hair.

Between December 30, 1995, and January 6, 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.f3.dion.ne.jp/~kameb/satella/st_slg.htm|script-title = ja:サウンドリンクゲーム一覧|publisher = The Satellaview History Museum|language = ja|date = 2008-02-12|last = Kameb|access-date = 2009-04-22|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090206204922/http://www.f3.dion.ne.jp/~kameb/satella/st_slg.htm|archive-date = 2009-02-06}}</ref> a second version of the game, {{nihongo|''BS Zelda no Densetsu MAP 2''|BS ゼルダの伝説ＭＡＰ２}}, was broadcast to the Satellaview as the functional equivalent of the original ''The Legend of Zelda''{{'}}s Second Quest. ''MAP 2'' was rebroadcast only once, in March 1996.<ref name=kameb/>
