{{nihongo foot|'''''Rolling Thunder'''''|ローリングサンダー|Rōringu Sandā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[run and gun video game]] developed by [[Namco]] in Japan and Europe and released in 1986 as a coin-operated [[arcade video game]] using the [[Namco System 86]] hardware. It was distributed in North America by [[Atari Games]]. The player takes control of a secret agent who must rescue his female partner from a terrorist organization. ''Rolling Thunder'' was a commercial success in arcades, and it was released for various home computer platforms in 1987 and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1989. The original arcade game has been included in various classic game compilations as well. It influenced later arcade action franchises such as ''[[Shinobi (series)|Shinobi]]'' and ''[[Time Crisis]]'', which borrowed mechanics such as [[Cover system|taking cover]] behind crates.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Rolling Thunder (arcade version).png|thumb|left|Arcade version]]
The player controls Albatross, a member of the WCPO's (World Crime Police Organization) "Rolling Thunder" espionage unit. Albatross's mission is to save a missing female agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York.

Albatross must travel through two different segments or "stories", each composed of five stages, for a total of ten stages. Depending on the [[DIP switch]] settings, the player has the option to skip any of the first four stages and start at any point in "Story 1". On each stage, the player can enter doors to hide and [[Cover system|take cover]] from enemies, and he can use crates or other obstacles to take cover from enemy fire.<ref name="denofgeek"/> The player can jump over crates<ref name="denofgeek"/> or jump up to higher or lower floors with rails, including stairs. The stages in "Story 2" are essentially harder versions of their "Story 1" counterparts, featuring more traps and different enemy placement. At the end of each stage, scenes from Leila's capture and ensuing torture are shown on an in-game large monitor screen.

The player begins the game armed with a standard-issue pistol, which can be replaced with a submachine gun (that appears based on the distinctive real life Beretta M12 SMG) that allows for continuous firing by holding down the shoot button. The player can find ammunition for either weapon by entering doors which are marked "bullets" or "arms". If the player runs out of machine gun ammo, they will switch back to the pistol. However, if the pistol runs out of ammo as well, then the player can only fire a single slow "chaser" bullet on-screen at a time until more ammo is acquired. The player can only take two physical hits from the enemy, as a single hit drains half of the life meter; the player is killed instantly when struck by a projectile attack such as enemy bullets or lasers, time runs out, or when falling without a floor.

The main enemies are hooded soldiers known as Maskers. Their various outfits and colors determine their strength and attack pattern respectively. Some Maskers only throw grenades, and others will shoot while kneeling. Other enemies include ninjas, mutated bats known as Gelzos, panthers, shrieking yellow creatures known as Blogas, and lava men. At the end of the final stage, the player must battle the Geldra leader Maboo to rescue Leila and complete the mission.

In 1988, [[U.S. Gold]] released home computer versions of ''Rolling Thunder'' in Europe for ,<ref>{{WoS game|id=0004234|name=Rolling Thunder}}</ref> [[Amstrad CPC]],[[Commodore 64]], ,[[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]]. These five computer versions were developed by [[Tiertex Design Studios|Tiertex]]. Only the Commodore 64 version has some different colors for the outfit of the Maskers; in the Amiga, Atari ST, and Amstrad CPC versions, the Maskers have the same colors. The ZX Spectrum version is almost monochrome, but has fast gameplay.

On March 17, 1989, Namco released a home version of ''Rolling Thunder'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in Japan. This version was localized in North America by [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]], which released their [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version unlicensed by Nintendo. The Famicom/NES version features a few minor changes and additions from the arcade version, such as a password feature, hidden bonuses, and a harder second mission accessible by inputting a password given to the player for completing the normal mission. Namco's Famicom version of ''Rolling Thunder'' has an onboard sound chip using the extra sound channels of the cartridge slot.

An [[Atari Lynx]] conversion of ''Rolling Thunder'' was announced in a Lynx catalog, with a scheduled May 1992 release date, but was later canceled.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/grey-matters-volume-3-1992#page/n25/mode/1up|title=Upcoming Games: Rolling Thunder|magazine=Grey Matters|volume=3|publisher=[[Atari Corporation]]|date=1992|pages=26}}</ref>

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Rolling Thunder'' among the most popular arcade games in February 1987.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=301|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 February 1987|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref> In the United States, the game was one of the top four highest-grossing [[1987 in video games|arcade games of 1987]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Nominees Announced For AMOA's JB, Games, & Vending Promo Awards |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=October 3, 1987 |page=37 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/80s/1987/CB-1987-10-03.pdf#page=37}}</ref> The arcade game was a commercial success in Europe.<ref name="YS"/>

Upon release, Clare Edgeley wrote a very short review of the arcade game in ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', saying that the gameplay in ''Rolling Thunder'' is "rather slow" and that she wouldn't recommend it to anyone "keen on a bit of fast action".<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |last1=Edgeley |first1=Clare |title=Arcade Action |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=February 1987 |issue=65 (March 1987) |pages=92–93 |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-065/page/n91/mode/2up}}</ref>

''[[Your Sinclair]]'' magazine reviewed the [[ZX Spectrum]] version in February 1988, giving it a highly positive review and rating it 9 of 10.<ref name="YS">{{cite magazine |last1=Snout |first1=Philip |title=Rolling Thunder |magazine=[[Your Sinclair]] |date=February 1988 |issue=27 (March 1988) |pages=18–9 |url=https://archive.org/details/your-sinclair-27/page/n17/mode/2up}}</ref>

In 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' ranked the arcade version as the 43rd game of all time, citing the "long-legged" characters, "wonderfully" designed levels, weapons, the use of panthers as enemies, character's ability to duck behind boxes, the constant need to jump from the floor to raised platforms, and "great" music.<ref>{{cite magazine | title = 43.

==Legacy==
''Rolling Thunder'' was followed by a sequel for the arcades titled ''[[Rolling Thunder 2]]'' in 1990. A port for the [[Sega Genesis]] and Mega Drive was released in 1991, followed by ''[[Rolling Thunder 3]]'' for the Genesis in North America in 1993.

A theme based on ''Rolling Thunder'', featuring several characters from the game is featured in ''[[Pac-Man 99]]'', as special DLC.

''Rolling Thunder'' spawned several clones in the late 1980s. [[Sega]]'s ''[[Shinobi (1987 video game)|Shinobi]]'' (1987) upon release drew comparisons to ''Rolling Thunder'', as well as a copy from the South Korean company SunA in which they titled ''Super Ranger'' (1988).<ref name="SU75">{{cite magazine |title=Coin Ops |magazine=[[Sinclair User]] |date=18 May 1988 |issue=75 (June 1988) |pages=82–3 |url=https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/sinclair-user/75#82}}</ref>

Ryan Lambie, writing for ''[[Den of Geek]]'', considers ''Rolling Thunder'' to be "the precursor to the modern [[Cover system|cover]] [[Shooter game|shooter]]" due to how the player can hide behind crates, doors and other obstacles to avoid enemy fire. ''Rolling Thunder'' established the "walk-and-shoot" template later used by the [[Shinobi (series)|''Shinobi'' series]], which borrows a number of similar mechanics, such as jumping on crates, taking cover behind crates, and jumping up to higher levels. Lambie also considers Namco's ''[[Time Crisis]]'' series to be a spiritual successor to ''Rolling Thunder'', citing similarities like how the player can "take cover behind crates, shoot multi-colored goons with a pistol, and gradually make your way through a villain's lair in search of a [[damsel in distress]]".<ref name="denofgeek">{{cite news |last1=Lambie |first1=Ryan |title=Rolling Thunder: Namco's Hidden Arcade Gem |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/games/rolling-thunder-history/ |access-date=11 April 2021 |work=[[Den of Geek]] |date=15 March 2019}}</ref>
