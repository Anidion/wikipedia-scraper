'''''They Stole a Million''''' is a strategy computer game released by [[Ariolasoft]] in 1986. The objective of the game is to plan robberies and execute the [[crime]].
The player first purchases [[blueprint]]s of the house where the soon-to-be-stolen object is kept. Then several specialists can be hired which disable [[burglar alarm|alarm]]s, open [[Lock (security device)|lock]]s or drive the [[getaway car]].

The planning stage allows the player to set [[waypoint]]s, actions, and the times at which the actions should take place. For example, the alarm specialist needs two minutes to disable the alarm for a certain display. After two minutes, the lock picking master opens the display and takes the loot.
