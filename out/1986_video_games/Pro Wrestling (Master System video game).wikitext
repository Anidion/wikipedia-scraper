'''''Pro Wrestling''''', known as {{nihongo|'''''Gokuaku Doumei Dump Matsumoto'''''|極悪同盟 ダンプ松本}} in Japan, is a [[professional wrestling]] [[video game]] released for the [[Master System]] in 1986 by Sega. It centers around [[tag team]] wrestling, with four duos that players can select and guide to various [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championship titles]] around the world. ''Pro Wrestling'' was the only professional wrestling title released for the Master System in United States.<ref name=AllgameRev /> The game has received mixed reviews, with publications criticizing the game's graphics and controls.

In Japan, the game is the home counterpart to the Sega [[arcade video game]] ''Dump Matsumoto'' (released outside Japan as ''Body Slam''). Like the arcade game, it features female wrestler [[Dump Matsumoto]] and her [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#S)|stable]] Gokuaku Doumei. In addition to having an entirely different, all-female roster, the Japanese version also has a final hidden matchup against aliens on another planet.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Sms prowrestlingingame.png|thumb|left|Mad Soldiers face off against the Orient Express.]] 
Player select from one of four tag teams: the Crush Brothers (Elder and Younger Crusher), the Orient Express (Dragonfly and Giant Bull), the Mad Soldiers (Muscle Soldier and Iron Soldier) and the Great Maskmen (Green Mask and Stone Head). The player's selected tag team contests for three titles against two of the other three teams ([[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#F|face]] tag teams only face [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#H|heel]] counterparts and vice versa) in this order: the [[Mexico|Mexican]] League title in Mexico, the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] League title - in [[Hawaii]] and finally, the World Title in [[New York City]]. Each match is a ten-[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#F|fall]] match up, which means that the player has to defeat the opponent in ten rounds before winning the title.<ref name=AllgameOverview>{{cite web |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12060 |title=Pro Wrestling - Overview |publisher=Rovi |work=Allgame |first=Jonathan |last=Sutyak |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115042630/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12060 |archivedate=November 15, 2014}}</ref>

From a standing position, punches and kicks can be performed. Once the opponent is on the ground, the player has the options of performing a grappling move, [[Professional wrestling throws#Irish whip|whipping]] the opponent into the ropes or going for the [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pin]].<ref name=AllgameRev /> Grappling moves vary from ground attacks like knee drops to pinning/submission holds like the [[Boston crab]] or [[Suplex#German suplex|German suplex]].<ref name=AllgameOverview /> Additional moves can be performed after the opponent has been whipped into the ropes. Two teams can pick up a steel chair from outside of the ring and use it as a weapon. The other two teams can only touch the chair to make it disappear; these two teams can also perform aerial maneuvers and [[Professional wrestling holds|submission moves]]. [[Continue (video gaming)|Continues]] are available for matches in the first two leagues.<ref name=AllgameRev>{{cite web |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12060&tab=review |title=Pro Wrestling - Review |publisher=Rovi |work=Allgame |first=Jonathan |last=Sutyak |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115042630/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12060&tab=review |archivedate=November 15, 2014}}</ref>

A two-player mode is also available without a time limit,<ref name=AllgameRev /> but there are restrictions on the match ups players can choose.

The game's attempt at imitating the spectacle of American pro wrestling was lauded, but overall the game received largely mixed reviews. ''[[Sega Pro]]'' gave it a positive review, with an 81% rating, describing it as "great fun", particularly with two players.<ref name=SP>{{cite journal|title=Pro Wrestling|journal=Sega Pro|issue=5|page=21}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the game a 46% overall rating; in its ''Complete Guide to Sega'', they criticized the game's graphics and sound and called the control scheme "awkward".<ref name=CVG>{{cite journal|title=Pro Wrestling|journal=Complete Guide to Sega|publisher=Computer and Video Games|page=59}}</ref>

[[Allgame]] offered a positive review, complimenting its visual style and calling the graphics "bright and cartoonish". Reviewer Jonathan Sutyak said that while the game got repetitive after a while and was not much of a challenge, it had a "good variety of moves" and was fun.<ref name=AllgameRev />

==Japanese version==
The Japanese version, ''Gokuaku Doumei Dump Matsumoto'' is named after female professional wrestler [[Dump Matsumoto]] and her [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] Gokuaku Domei. Two teams represent Gokuaku Domei: one consists of Matsumoto and [[Bull Nakano]] and the other has Condor Saito and Masked Yu. Two other teams represent the faction "Fresh Gals": team 1 are Dump's rivals the Crush Gals ([[Lioness Asuka]] and [[Chigusa Nagayo]]) and team 2 are the [[Jumping Bomb Angels]].

Despite featuring female wrestlers exclusively, the gameplay is almost identical. Instead of just a steel chair, there are a variety of weapons for use such as the ring bell. Some graphics and music are different as well. A hidden fourth match against an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] tag team is accessible via [[cheat code]].

A [[List of Sega arcade system boards#Sega System 16|System 16]] arcade game featuring Matsumoto, simply called ''Dump Matsumoto'', was also released by Sega in 1986. The game, known outside Japan as ''Body Slam'', featured the same characters as the Master System game and allowed players to form custom duos composed of two members from each faction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coin-Op Museum: Dump Matsumoto|url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7666|accessdate=May 9, 2006}}</ref>
