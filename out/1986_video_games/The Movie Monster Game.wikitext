'''''The Movie Monster Game''''' is a computer game released by [[Epyx]] for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]] in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]]. The game offers a variety of scenarios, playable monsters, and cities to demolish (complete with famous landmarks, such as [[Tokyo Tower]], [[Eiffel Tower]], [[Statue of Liberty]], [[Golden Gate Bridge]], [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] and [[Big Ben]]). The monsters are based on popular movie monsters such as [[The Blob]], [[Mothra]], the [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]], and the [[Transformers]], and Epyx was able to officially license [[Godzilla]].

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is depicted on a movie screen in front of a movie theater crowd simulating an actual monster movie. Each scenario even starts off with an advertisement, (for [[popcorn]] and "Gummi Glogs"; in the [[Apple II]] version "Godzilla Mouthwash" is also featured), and other attractions, (such as promotions for [[Epyx]]'s own ''[[Summer Games (video game)|Summer Games]]'') before the "Feature Presentation" of the game begins.

The game includes 5 different scenarios for the player to play through:<ref name=manual/>

#''Berserk''. The player must accumulate a certain number of points by destroying as many buildings and vehicles as possible.
#''Escape''. The player must flee the city before being killed by the military.
#''Search''. The player must use the monster to rescue its offspring hidden in a building. Godzilla's son is depicted as [[Minilla]].
#''Destroy Landmark''. The player must destroy a specific landmark within the city such as the [[Statue of Liberty]] in New York City, the [[Tokyo Tower]] in Tokyo, [[Big Ben]] in London, etc.
#''Lunch''. The player must satisfy the monster's hunger by eating vehicles and civilians until the monster's hunger meter is depleted.

The monsters are ''[[Godzilla]]'', ''Sphectra'' (a giant wasp), ''The Glog'' (a huge green blob with red eyes), ''Tarantus'' (a giant Tarantula), ''Mr. Meringue'' (a knock-off of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man), and ''Mechatron'' (a knock-off of [[tfwiki:Topspin_(G1)|Topspin]] from Transformers).<ref name=manual/>
