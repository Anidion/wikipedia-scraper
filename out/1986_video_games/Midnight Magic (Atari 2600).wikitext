'''''Midnight Magic''''' is a [[Pinball#Video game simulations|pinball video game]] written by Glenn Axworthy for the [[Atari 2600]] and released by [[Atari Corporation]] in 1986, although on-screen it displays a copyright of 1984.

In spite of licensing the name from Broderbund, the Atari 2600 version of ''Midnight Magic'' uses a completely different table design from ''[[David's Midnight Magic]]'', a pinball simulation published for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] in 1982.

==Gameplay==
''Midnight Magic'' uses the [[Atari CX40 joystick|CX40]] [[joystick]] for activating the flippers and shooting the ball. Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. Hitting all five drop targets at the top of the table increases the bonus multiplier (2x, 3x, and so on). Extra balls can be earned when hitting the rollover targets at the top left and right corners of the table when the bonus multiplier is activated.<ref>[http://www.atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=300 AtariAge - Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Midnight Magic (Atari)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
