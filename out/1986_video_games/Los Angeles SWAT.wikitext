'''''Los Angeles SWAT''''' (also known as '''''L.A. SWAT''''') is a 1986 video game released by [[Mastertronic]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. In this game, the player assumed the role of a [[Los Angeles]] police officer fighting rioters. The Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit versions share a disk with ''[[Panther (1986 video game)|Panther]]'', another Mastertronic game. The one side of the disk contains the two programs for the C64, while the other has Atari 8-bit versions.

==Gameplay==
In each level, the player moves toward the top of the screen avoiding or shooting the rioters, who would either lob grenades, if at a distance, or beat your character to the pavement with clubs if in melee range.

At the end of each level, a procession of gang members (usually with a single shirt color, marching in formation) streams down from the top of the screen. After killing all of these gang members, a single gang member, the boss, moves randomly around the screen with a woman next to him. Shooting the woman causes the player to lose points, while successfully shooting only the gangser causes her to "take the arm" of your character.

As the levels progress, the gangers become more frequent and the player begins to see cars placed perpendicular to the street, acting as roadblocks.

==Reception==
''[[Zzap!64]]'' found the game to be in dubious taste yet undoubtedly enjoyable to play, despite the poor graphics and sound.  It was given an overall rating of 74%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=022&amp;page=097&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap&amp;check=1|title = Impossible to Display Scan}}</ref>
