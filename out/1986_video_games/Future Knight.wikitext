==Reception==
''[[Sinclair User]]'':{{quote|If you leave Randolph standing still for too long a period, he'll wave at you as incentive to get a move on. Leave him in the same spot for much longer and things start to get really desperate: Randolph will go completely bezerk, spinning round and round, flailing his arms and panicking in an astoundingly convincing manner. Ignore him then and the chances are his constitution will plummet at a tremendous rate.<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{Cite news|title=Future Knight Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=December 1986}}</ref>}}
