{{nihongo|'''''Action Fighter'''''|アクション ファイター}} is an overhead [[vehicular combat game]] released by [[Sega]] for [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1986. It was ported to the [[Master System]] the same year, and then to the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[IBM PC compatible]] computers.

The player begins the game riding a [[superbike]]. In subsequent levels a sports car, a jet via added wings, [[jetski]], helicopter and [[Formula One]] racing car can all be driven, as seen in the game's title screen. All of the vehicles are armed to deal with enemy vehicles and gun emplacements. The helicopter levels play as a [[vertically scrolling shooter]].
