'''''Shard of Spring''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[TX Digital Illusions]] and published by [[Strategic Simulations]] for the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[DOS]] computers in 1986. ''Shard of Spring'' tells the story of a group of adventurers hired to retrieve the titular magical item stolen by a power-hungry evil witch. The game was generally well received upon its release and was followed by a sequel titled ''[[Demon's Winter]]'' in 1988.

==Gameplay==
The player's [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] in ''Shard of Spring'' can be made up of at least two human, [[Dwarf (folklore)|dwarf]], [[elf]], [[troll]] or [[gnome]] adventurers, each of whom can be either a [[warrior]] or a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] (both classes have very different set of traits to assign points to).<ref name = "CGW"/> The game's game world system is displayed in the top-down view, and the combat system for the fights (mostly random encounters) is similar to turn-based tactical war games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/questbusters-v3n09/qbusters_v3_n09#page/n3/mode/2up/ |title=QuestBusters: The Adventurer's Journal Volume 3 Number 09 |access-date=2014-05-13}}</ref> Its spell system is based on five elements: fire, metal, wind, ice and spirit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commodore.ca/gallery/magazines/ahoy/Ahoy-issue-34-01.pdf |title=Ahoy!

==Plot==
For two centuries, a small island of Ymros enjoyed eternal springtime thanks to the enchanted Shard of Spring, a piece of the long-lost legendary Life Stone. However, three years ago, the land's peace was shattered when a mysterious Siriadne arrived to Ymros and stole the Shard. With the threat of the Shard's destruction, the selfish sorceress and her minions now extort a ruinous and ever-increasing tribute from the people of Ymros. Anyone who might put an end to her tyranny will be a hero for all time to come. The aim of the game is to gain access to Siriadne's castle (which is encircled by a magical force field) and defeat her.<ref name="qb">{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/questbusters-v3n09/qbusters_v3_n09#page/n3/mode/2up | title=Shard of Spring | work=QuestBusters | date=September 1986 | access-date=2015-01-15 | pages=4–5}}</ref> The player needs to kill Siriadne's chief followers Devon the Destroyer,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/02-commodore-magazine/Commodore_Magazine_Vol-08-N02_1987_Feb#page/n128/mode/1up|title=Commodore Magazine Issue 02|date=February 1987 |access-date=20 January 2015}}</ref> Ralith (in Ralith's Tower)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gold_Mine_Game_Tips_for_Commodore_Users#page/n246/mode/1up|title=Gold Mine Game Tips for Commodore Users|access-date=20 January 2015}}</ref> and Edrin (in Edrin's Dungeon) so the party can storm Siriadne's Fortress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/29-commodore-magazine/Commodore_Magazine_Vol-10-N05_1989_May#page/n96/mode/1up/ |title=Commodore Magazine Issue 29 |date=May 1989 |access-date=2014-05-13}}</ref> Siriadne herself transforms into a dragon for the final battle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-033/ZZap_64_Issue_033_1987_Jan#page/n118/mode/1up|title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 033|date=January 1987 |access-date=20 January 2015}}</ref> After the player's victory, the game ends in a cryptic way.<ref>"(...) As you turn to go back into the room, you see a black bird out of the corner of your eye, moving swiftly upward. As you re-enter the room, an old man who you recognize is standing near the dead body of Siriadne. His face shows a mixture of serenity and contentment. He speaks: 'The true springtime shall now return to Ymros because of what you have done today. Your names shall be remembered as long as men exist to sing of you.' He makes some mysterious motions and everything begins to swirl about you. His voice speaks to you out of the dizziness: 'Evil is personified in the form of dragons, but borne in the hearts of men...'"</ref>

==Reception==
SSI sold 11,942 copies of ''Shard of Spring'' in North America.<ref name="maher20160318">{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2016/03/opening-the-gold-box-part-3-from-tabletop-to-desktop/ | title=Opening the Gold Box, Part 3: From Tabletop to Desktop | publisher=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2016-03-18 | access-date=19 March 2016 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref> The game was generally well received upon its release. According to ''QuestBusters'', "anyone completely burned out on the 'seek and slay' scenario should look elsewhere," but "''[[Phantasie]]'' fans who found ''[[Wizard's Crown]]'' too complex will appreciate this one, which combines the best elements of each - easily making it SSI's best game since the original ''Phantasie''."<ref name=qb/> [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave the game a positive review in 1986, noting it as a good [[hack and slash]] type. The graphics were considered well-done, even in [[monochrome]], but the reviewer felt leveling in the later part of the game went far too slowly.<ref name = "CGW">{{citation | date = Dec 1986 | author=Scorpia | magazine = Computer Gaming World | title = Shard of Spring  | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&pub=2&id=33 | pages = 38–41}}</ref> In 1993, she called ''Shard of Spring'' "a typical hack-and-slash romp" but "not bad for its type, and better than some".<ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | access-date=25 March 2016 | author=Scorpia | pages=34–50}}</ref> On the other hand, Philippa Irving in ''[[Zzap!64]]'' criticized the game's "lacklustre" presentation (55%) and "dull" graphics 65%, but nevertheless gave ''Shard of Spring'' a high overall rating of 88%, calling it "just short of brilliant" due to its "absorbing, tantalizing, and satisfying" playability.<ref name = "ZZAP!">{{citation | date = Sep 1987 | author= Philippa Irving | periodical = Zzap!64 | title = Shard of Spring  | page = 55}}</ref> Rick Teverbaugh of ''[[RUN (magazine)|RUN]]'' also gave it a positive review, even as he opined it was not "exactly a frontrunner in the [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]] voting."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/run-magazine-40/Run_Issue_40_1987_Apr#page/n29/mode/2up/ |title=Run Magazine Issue 40 |date=April 1987 |access-date=2014-05-13}}</ref>

The game, however, did not become a classic title. Tim Bailey reviewed ''Shard of Spring'' in ''[[The Space Gamer|Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]'' commented that "if you have the money to spare, and ''[[Ultima IV]]'' is not available, and you can't wait, ''Shard of Spring'' is a good, but inferior imitation."<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Tim|date=August–September 1987|title=A Poor Man's Ultima|journal=[[The Space Gamer|Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]|publisher=Diverse Talents, Incorporated|issue=79|pages=43}}</ref> In 1987, Mark Patters of ''[[Commodore User]]'' gave ''Shard of Spring'' a rating of 6/10.<ref name="CU">{{citation | date = Apr 1987 | author= Mark Patters|periodical = Commodore User | title = Shard of Spring  | page = 32}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/commodore-user-magazine-43/Commodore_User_Issue_43_1987_Apr#page/n31/mode/1up/ |title=Commodore User Magazine Issue 43 |date=April 1987 |access-date=2014-05-13}}</ref> Reviewers often compared this game to ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]''. According to a critical retrospective review by John Gorenfeld in [[Allgame]], "unlike ''Wizard's Crown'', SSI's RPG ''Shard of Spring'' has none of the company's characteristic war game detail. In fact, it feels like a low-rent version of ''Ultima III'', with the latter's simple tactical combat, but less atmosphere."<ref name=ag>{{cite web|last=Gorenfeld |first=John |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=37033 |title=Shard of Spring |publisher=allgame |date=2010-10-03 |access-date=2013-07-28}}</ref> It was reported that the game had a balance problem in which the players would receive too few [[experience point]]s for their victories;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/computist-scan-41/issue41#page/n27/mode/1up/s |title=Computist Issue #41 |year=1987 |access-date=2014-05-13}}</ref> this problem was fixed in the sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/questbusters-v5n12/qbusters_v5_n12#page/n3/mode/2up/ |title=QuestBusters: The Adventurer's Journal Volume 5 Number 12 |access-date=2014-05-13}}</ref>

==Legacy==
{{main|Demon's Winter}}
A follow-up to ''Shard of Spring'' was created by the same team and published by SSI in 1988. The sequel has Ymros once again threatened by evil as the players must search for spells to defeat the demon-god Malifon who has cast the world into a deep freeze. It expanded on the first game in some ways such as offering more character classes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/run-magazine-69 |title=''Run'' 69 (September 1989) |date=September 1989 |format=PDF |access-date=2014-05-13}}</ref>
