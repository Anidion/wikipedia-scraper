'''''Lock-On''''' is a 1986 first-person [[combat flight simulator]] [[video game]] with a futuristic theme. It was developed by Tatsumi and licensed to [[Data East]] for US distribution. Its graphics feature [[2.5D|scaling sprites]] and a full-screen rotation effect. The game consists of 20 levels. Gameplay is similar to ''[[After Burner]]'': the plane follows a predefined path, but the player can steer it slightly to evade incoming missiles. The player can fire guns and homing missiles, the latter of which requires the eponymous lock-on first.
