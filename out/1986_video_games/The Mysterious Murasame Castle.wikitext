It was released exclusively in Japan on April 14, 1986. The game was one of the early games released for the system, and the second original game after ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''. The game was released outside Japan for the first time on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Virtual Console]] in Europe and Australia in May 2014<ref name="EU release">{{cite web |url=http://www.thenintendochannel.com/news.php?n=855 |title=European download update revealed for May 29, 2014 |website=The Nintendo Channel |date=May 26, 2014 |access-date=May 26, 2014}}</ref><ref name="AUS release">{{cite web|last1=Wassenaar|first1=Troy|title=Nintendo Download Update (29/5) - Gaining Traction - eShop News from Vooks|url=http://www.vooks.net/nintendo-download-update-295-gaining-traction/|website=Vooks|access-date=18 July 2017|date=29 May 2014}}</ref> and in North America in August.<ref name="NA release">{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Chris|title=Mysterious Murasame Castle hitting the 3DS eShop next month|url=https://www.destructoid.com/mysterious-murasame-castle-hitting-the-3ds-eshop-next-month-278703.phtml|website=Destructoid|access-date=18 July 2017|language=en|date=28 July 2014}}</ref> It was added to the [[Nintendo Switch Online]] service on October 31, 2023.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |last1=Yin-Poole |first1=Wesley |title=Nintendo Switch Online Gets Two Obscure NES Games and a Castlevania Game Boy Game for Halloween |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-gets-two-obscure-nes-games-and-a-castlevania-game-boy-game-for-halloween |website=IGN |date=31 October 2023}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Nazo no murasame-jo screenshot1.PNG|left|frame|The player controls Takamaru throughout Murasame Castle.]]
The player takes on the role of the main protagonist Takamaru. The objective is to race through Murasame Castle and the four neighboring castles, obtain the four gems from the castle lords and defeat the main antagonist Murasame. The player moves from different directions in a top-down view with no side-scrolling. The game has only a limited number of power-ups, forcing players to rely on their own action skills more than anything else.

The game world has scrolls scattered throughout the castles for Takamaru to collect, and special raccoon suits may reveal power-ups. Players are given a certain number of lives, and may gain additional lives by rescuing the castles' princesses and playing through bonus rounds after completing the first half of each level. One life is lost when Takamaru's health gauge runs out or he runs out of time. When all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear, in which the player can continue the game or save their progress.

The game consists of five castles: Aosame Castle, Akasame Castle, Ryokusame Castle, Momosame Castle, and the titular Murasame Castle. The appearance of enemy characters (including [[samurai]], [[ninja]] and [[hannya]]) borrows heavily from existing Japanese culture. Each level, divided into two parts: the path to the castle, and the castle itself, is of considerable size, and Takamaru must defeat generic enemy characters to reach the innermost region of the castle where the castle-lord resides.

The player's only weapons are a [[katana]] and [[shuriken]]s; upgrades to the shuriken can be obtained, but are lost whenever Takamaru loses a life. The katana can only be used when Takamaru is close to an enemy or projectile (excluding fireballs), while the shurikens can only be used when he is farther away. The katana can also be used to deflect projectiles. Other items include fireballs, which are more powerful than the shurikens; a lightning-themed explosive, which gives heavy damage to every enemy on screen; and a cloak, which makes Takamaru invisible and invulnerable to enemies and objects for a short period of time. When Takamaru reaches more than 99 lives, he becomes invincible.

==Plot==
In [[Edo period|Edo-period]] Japan, Murasame Castle houses a gigantic stone statue known as Murasame. The people lived peacefully until one stormy night, when a shining golden object fell onto the castle from the sky. Deafening shrieks arose from the castle, and the shining object is later revealed to be an alien creature who gives life to the stone statue Murasame and takes over the castle. The alien creature extends its power to four other neighboring castles, giving the ''[[daimyō]]'' lords each an evil sphere of power. The lords are taken over by the alien's evil power, and use the spheres to summon ninja armies and monsters to attack villagers. Hearing of these strange occurrences, the shogunate led by [[Tokugawa Ietsuna]] sends Takamaru, a [[samurai]] apprentice, on a secret mission to investigate the castle. As Takamaru, the player must infiltrate the four castles to defeat each castle lord, before going on to face the alien entity itself.

== Development ==
Due to the game's initial obscurity, not much about its development is known, but [[Goichi Suda]], in an interview with [[Nintendo Life]], stated that [[Human Entertainment]] (where he started video game development) was involved in development of the game to some degree.<ref name="Suda">{{Cite web |date=2021-09-17 |title=SUDA51 Would Love To Revive A Lesser-Known Nintendo Classic |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/suda51_would_love_to_revive_a_lesser-known_nintendo_classic |access-date=2022-10-14 |website=Nintendo Life |language=en-GB}}</ref>
