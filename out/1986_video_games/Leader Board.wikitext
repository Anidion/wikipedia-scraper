'''''Leader Board''''', the first game in the series, was released in 1986 and included four different water-based [[golf course|courses]]. It was well received, being rated as 97% overall by ''[[Zzap!64]]'' magazine and being prized with their "Gold Award".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=15&page=19 |title=Leaderboard |work=[[Zzap!64]] |date=July 1986 |access-date=2009-11-12}}</ref> It was also highly rated by other magazines, with ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' rating it 9 out of 10,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/leaderboard.htm |title=Leaderboard |work=[[Your Sinclair]] |date=April 1987 |access-date=2009-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308041527/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/leaderboard.htm |archive-date=2013-03-08 }}</ref> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' giving it five stars,<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue061/Pages/SinclairUser06100053.jpg |title=Leaderboard |magazine=[[Sinclair User]] |date=April 1987 |access-date=2009-11-12}}</ref> and ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' rating it 80%.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue39/Pages/Crash3900016.jpg |title=Leaderboard |magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |date=April 1987 |access-date=2009-11-12}}</ref>

'''''Leaderboard Tournament''''', released the same year, was a series of expansion disks each containing four new courses.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/leaderboardtournament.htm |title=Leaderboard Tournament |magazine=[[Your Sinclair]] |date=August 1987 |access-date=2009-11-12}}</ref>

The second game in the series was '''''Leader Board: Executive Edition''''', which was released in 1987 and contained new landscape and course features, such as trees and [[bunker (golf)|bunkers]]. Despite these additions, the game was less well received than its predecessor, being given an overall rating of 72% by ''Zzap!64'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=24&page=36 |title=Leaderboard (Executive Edition) |work=[[Zzap 64]] |date=April 1987 |access-date=2009-11-12}}</ref>

'''''[[World Class Leader Board]]''''' was the last game in the series and included four courses; [[Champions Golf Club|Cypress Creek]], [[Doral Country Club]], [[Old Course at St Andrews|St Andrews]], and the fictional Gauntlet Country Club. Three course expansion disks were later released. Special features in this final version included a course overview (overhead view), the [[Glossary of golf#P|punch shot]], a printable score card, the use of [[RealSound]], and a course editor which allowed changes to be made to the existing courses. It was considered a vast improvement on Executive, being given a 94% overall rating by ''Zzap!64'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=27&page=18 |title=World Class Leaderboard |work=[[Zzap!64]] |date=July 1987 |access-date=2009-11-12}}</ref> and 9 out of 10 by ''Your Sinclair''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/worldclassleaderboard.htm |title=World Class Leaderboard |work=[[Your Sinclair]] |date=January 1988 |access-date=2009-11-12}}</ref>

Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Leader Board has the most realistic putting feel of any golf game I've ever tried. When the ball finally makes it into the cup, the sound of that success is also amazingly realistic."<ref name="CGW29">{{cite magazine |last=Teverbaugh |first=Rick |title=Sports Scoreboard |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jun–Jul 1986 |volume=1 |issue=29 |pages=32}}</ref> ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' praised the Commodore 64 version's realism and amazing ("there is no other word for it") graphics. While noting ''Leader Board''{{'}}s use of only [[water hazard]]s, and no difference in color between the [[fairway (golf)|fairway]] and [[green (golf)|green]], the magazine concluded that it "is fun, a lot of fun, and as addicting as the real game".<ref name="keizer198606">{{Cite magazine |last=Keizer |first=Gregg |date=June 1986 |title=Leader Board: The Pro Golf Simulator |url=https://archive.org/details/1986-06-computegazette/page/n51 |magazine=Compute!'s Gazette |pages=50–51 |access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that ''Leader Board'' for the Amiga improved on the Commodore 64 version, and praised the graphics, but preferred the also-outstanding ''[[Mean 18]]''.<ref name="wagner198612">{{cite magazine | title=Amiga Preferences | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=33 | date=December 1986 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&pub=2&id=33 | access-date=24 April 2016 | last=Wagner | first=Roy | pages=44}}</ref> ''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'' gave the Amiga version four stars out of five, liking the gameplay and "nicely done graphics" but noting the absence of a practice green or course construction.
