'''''The Transformers''''' is a [[Platform game|platform]] [[shoot 'em up]] game based on the ''[[Transformers]]'' franchise. It was written by [[Denton Designs]] and released by [[Ocean Software]] for the [[ZX Spectrum|Sinclair Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]] home computers in 1986.

==Gameplay==
In the game, the [[Autobot]]s are searching for four parts of an energon cube which have been scattered around a city, which consists of a number of platforms and ladders. The [[Decepticon]]s are also seeking the energon cube, and will destroy the Autobots in order to retrieve it.

The player controls five Autobots: [[Optimus Prime]], Hound, [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], one at a time. When not in use, the Autobots hide in Defensa-Pods;<ref name="Instructions">{{Citation|title=Instruction manual}}</ref> while inside these pods they cannot be harmed, and slowly recharge their energy. The Decepticons are represented by [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Starscream]], Buzzsaw, [[Skywarp]], [[Laserbeak]], Ravage, Frenzy and Rumble. The Decepticons can regenerate and do not transform.

Each Autobot has three attributes (Shields, Power and Weapons) with each character having them in different distributions (Optimus Prime has a high Power rating, average Shields and low Weapons, while Mirage has a high Weapons rating but lower Power and Shields).

Each character can transform between their vehicle and robot forms by facing forward and pressing the fire button. Unlike the cartoon, all the Autobots can fly while in robot form, although they travel faster by using their vehicle modes. Driving off the end of platforms or into stationary objects will cause the character to die.<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{Citation|title=Transformers Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=March 1986}}</ref>
