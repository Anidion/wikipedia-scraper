'''''Snail Maze''''' is a 1986 video game by [[Sega]] for the [[Master System]]. Instead of being released on a cartridge, it was built into the system's [[BIOS]]<ref>''The Games Machines'', {{ISBN|978-3-000-15359-4}} p. 198</ref> and could be played by starting the system without a game cartridge inserted and holding Up and buttons 1 and 2 simultaneously. Some later console models included a minimal BIOS because of memory constraints, and ''Snail Maze'' had to be removed. These systems instead included a built-in ''[[Alex Kidd in Miracle World]]'' or [[Sonic the Hedgehog (8-bit video game)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']]. ''Snail Maze'' was never released in cartridge or card format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://segadoes.com/2014/11/01/snail-maze/|title=Sega Does: Snail Maze|work=segadoes.com|date=November 1, 2014|access-date=September 15, 2021}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
A very simple game, ''Snail Maze'' involves navigating a small orange [[snail]] with a yellow shell through a blue [[maze]]. A goal area is clearly marked, which players must attempt to reach within a time limit.<ref>{{Citation|title=Sega Master System Snail Maze full playthrough|url=https://www.bitchute.com/video/MfcAuHYxeKZG/|language=en|access-date=2021-09-21}}</ref> Despite its relative simplicity compared to [[1980s in video gaming|other games of its era]], Snail Maze could be quite challenging. Subsequent levels reduce the time available, giving a progressively lower margin for error.<ref>''Service Games: The Rise and Fall of SEGA: Enhanced Edition'', {{ISBN|978-1-494-28835-8}} p. 36</ref>

==Legacy==
A version of ''Snail Maze'' was included on the [[Coleco Sonic]] handheld system, created in 2006. An emulated version of ''Snail Maze'' can be played in various entries of the ''[[Like a Dragon]]'' series by using an in-game Master System without selecting a game.

In 2004 an unofficial port of ''Snail Maze'' was made for the Japanese [[MSX]] computer platform with enhanced graphics and a new title screen. An unofficial port ''Snail Maze'' was released on [[iOS]] in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/iphone/697200-snail-maze | title=Snail Maze for iOS (IPhone/IPad) - GameFAQs }}</ref> An unofficial port of ''Snail Maze'' was released in December 2015 for the [[TI-84 Plus CE]] graphing calculator, written in [[Zilog eZ80|eZ80]] assembly language.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Snail Maze v1.0.0|url=https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/1405/x1405|access-date=2021-09-07|website=www.cemetech.net|language=en}}</ref>
