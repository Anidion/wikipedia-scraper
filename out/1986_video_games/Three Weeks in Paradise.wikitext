'''''Three Weeks in Paradise''''' is a [[video game]] released in 1986 by [[Mikro-Gen]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005239|title = World of Spectrum - Three Weeks in Paradise}}</ref> It is the last action-adventure platform in the [[Wally Week]] series.

==Gameplay==
The Week family are lost on a tropical island inhabited by a hostile local tribe - the "[[Human cannibalism|Can Nibbles]]". Herbert and Wilma (Wally's son and wife) have been captured and Wally must rescue them and build a raft to escape.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Three Weeks in Paradise {{!}} Team SpecNG|url = http://www.specng.org/downloads/three-weeks-in-paradise/|website = www.specng.org|access-date = 2015-12-02}}</ref>

The player controls Wally and must solve puzzles and avoid obstacles such as animals and natives - especially the tribal chief, who is patrolling the area.  Each puzzle solved builds a piece of escape raft.  As with previous Wally games humour plays an important part in both the gameplay and puzzle solving.

The graphics were detailed and the Spectrum version had an option to switch off Wally's natural colour, which would remove the [[Attribute clash|colour clash]].  The ZX Spectrum +128 version included enhanced sound and additional underwater screens with objects to use, but the rest of the game - including the solution - remains the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Crash_No._27_1986-04_Newsfield_GB/page/n34/mode/1up?view=theater|title=All the little extra bits|date=April 1986|last=Rignall|first=Julian|work=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|pages=34–35|access-date=3 October 2023}}</ref>

==Development==

''Three Weeks'' was originally intended to be a [[Mikro-Gen#Mikro-Plus|Mikro-Plus]] product,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/your-spectrum-magazine-20/page/n12/mode/1up?view=theater|title=More Plus|work=[[Your Sinclair|Your Spectrum]]|date=November 1985 |access-date=3 October 2023}}</ref> but the failure of that peripheral meant that it was released as a standard software title instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ComputerAndVideoGamesIssue051Jan86/page/n7/mode/1up?view=theater|title=News|date=January 1986|work=Computer and Video Games|access-date=3 October 2023}}</ref>
