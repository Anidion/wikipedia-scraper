'''''Battlefront ''''' is a [[Wargame (video games)|computer wargame]] developed and published by [[Strategic Studies Group]] for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]] in 1986. The game is a turn-based strategy set in [[World War II]].

== Gameplay ==
''Battlefront'' is a [[corps]]-level simulation wargame. Upon starting the game, player chooses from one of four scenarios that depict battles of World War II.

== Development ==
The game was designed, programmed and finished in 14 weeks. [[Roger Keating]] created a dedicated disc operating system for the game that allowed rapid access to the data stored on the disc with subsequent reloading of the game screen. Additionally, Keating wrote a novel pathfinding routine that helped to minimize memory usage.<ref name="Chatteur">

== Reception ==
Jay Selover reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Battlefront'' is a very good game which does an excellent job of putting the player into an authentic combat role: that of a Corps commander."<ref name="CGW32">{{cite magazine |last=Selover |first=Jay |title=Battlefront: Corps Level Command in World War II |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=November 1986 |volume=1 |issue=32 |pages=28–29, 50–51}}</ref>

A reviewer of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' praised the game's historical accuracy and the possibility to create custom scenarios, but criticised the graphics. He stated that ''Battlefront'' "is a very good attempt, but it is not the perfect game that it might have been".<ref name=CVG/>

The game was nominated by ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' for Strategy Game of the Year in 1987, but lost to ''[[Gettysburg: The Turning Point]]'' by [[Chuck Kroegel]].<ref name=CGW87>{{cite magazine|title=CGW meets Dragon Con 87|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=December 1987|issue=42|page=62}}</ref> Bruce Geryk in his article "Innovation Wars", published in 2006 in ''Computer Gaming World'' described ''Battlefront'' as legendary and said that "its landmark gameplay revolutionized the genre".<ref name=CGW06>{{cite magazine| last1 = Geryk | first1 = Bruce |title=Innovation Wars|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=September 2006|issue=266|page=97}}</ref>
