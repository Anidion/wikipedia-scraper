'''''Uridium''''' (released on the NES as '''''The Last Starfighter''''')<ref name='retrogamer' /> is a [[science fiction]] [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[shoot 'em up]] originally designed by [[Andrew Braybrook]] for the [[Commodore 64]], and later ported to other 8-bit machines. It consists of fifteen levels,<ref name="nintendolife">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2008/03/uridium_virtual_console|title=Review: Uridium (Virtual Console / Commodore 64)|date=March 29, 2008|website=Nintendo Life|access-date=October 28, 2021|archive-date=March 4, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210304132320/https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2008/03/uridium_virtual_console|url-status=live}}</ref> each named after a metal element, with the last level being called ''Uridium'' (a [[List of fictional elements, materials, isotopes and subatomic particles|fictional metallic element]], not to be confused with the real metallic element [[iridium]]). The manual quotes Robert Orchard, who invented the name as saying "I really thought it existed".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hem.passagen.se/godabe/uridium/game.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010817083522/http://hem.passagen.se/godabe/uridium/game.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-08-17 | title=Uridium | publisher=TEMPE | access-date=2007-04-04}}</ref>

''Uridium'' was later released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990. [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]] purchased a license to release a game based on the film ''[[The Last Starfighter]]''.<ref name='retrogamer'>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-making-of-uridium/|title=The Making Of Uridium &#124; Retro Gamer|website=www.retrogamer.net|date=10 October 2014 |access-date=2018-05-04|archive-date=2019-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190718001629/https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-making-of-uridium/|url-status=live}}</ref> Rather than program a new game, however, Mindscape decided to take an easier route by recycling an older, relatively obscure game. The title screen, sprites, and soundtrack were modified, but the levels and gameplay were identical. In 2003, it was re-released on the [[C64 Direct-to-TV]].

In 2008, the C64 version was a title on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/02/commodore_64_coming_to_virtual_console|title=Commodore 64 coming to Virtual Console|date=February 21, 2008|website=Nintendo Life|access-date=October 28, 2021|archive-date=January 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210120161856/https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/02/commodore_64_coming_to_virtual_console|url-status=live}}</ref> released on 28 March for the Virtual Console in Europe, costing 500 [[Wii Points]].<ref name="nintendolife"/>

==Plot==
The plot of ''Uridium'' is described as follows:

<blockquote>The [[Solar System|solar system]] is under attack! Enemy Super-[[Dreadnought]]s have been placed in orbit around each of the fifteen [[planet]]s in this galactic sector. They are draining mineral resources from the planetary cores for use in their interstellar power units. Each Super-Dreadnought seeks out a different metal for its metal converter.<br />
Your Manta class Space Fighter will be transported to each planet in turn and it is your task to destroy each Dreadnought. First you must attack the defensive screen of enemy fighters, then you must neutralise the majority of surface defences before you land on the Super-Dreadnought's master runway. Once on board you must pull as many fuel rods as possible from the metal converters before you take off for a final strafing run as the Dreadnought vaporises into the ether.</blockquote>

==Gameplay==

In practice, each level takes place at a fixed altitude just above the surface of the Dreadnoughts. The screen scrolls horizontally in both directions as the Manta flies over the Dreadnoughts. Each Dreadnought has a different configuration of walls and other structures which must be negotiated in order to reach the landing zone. This task is hampered by squadrons of enemy fighters that attack the Manta in waves. Lastly, flashing ports on the Dreadnought's surface release homing [[naval mine|mine]]s that cannot be destroyed. It takes a skillful Manta pilot to outfly the mines until they self-detonate.

Only when enough of the Dreadnought's defenses have been destroyed is the "Land Now!" signal activated, allowing the player to slow the Manta's speed to a minimum and land on the sternward landing zone. After this, the pilot presumably enters the interior of the mothership and sets its nuclear reactor to self-destruct. Finally, the Manta takes off again as the Dreadnought below crumbles to atoms. As the Manta flies over the Dreadnought again the player has the opportunity to shoot any remaining defences.<ref name="eurogamer">{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/R-Uridium_c64|title=Uridium|first=Kristan|last=Reed|newspaper=Eurogamer.net |date=October 26, 2007|access-date=October 28, 2021|archive-date=July 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712055302/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/R-Uridium_c64|url-status=live}}</ref>

Later Dreadnoughts have tricky wall configurations where the gap between the walls is so narrow that the Manta must turn sideways in order to pass through it.<ref name="eurogamer"/> This required skillful use of the [[joystick]]. More skill could be exhibited (and more points awarded) by ignoring the "Land Now!" signal and destroying the elite fighters that attacked in waves of one.

The final Dreadnought, Uridium, actually contains only a few screens of gameplay; the bulk of this Dreadnought consists of the "congratulations" message for completing the game (i.e., "''GOOD ZAPPING... TURKEY.''"). This is initially made inaccessible by an impassable wall, but visible in the final overflight when the Dreadnought is destroyed.

==Technical details==
When ''Uridium'' was originally released, reviewers were impressed by the way the Dreadnoughts were presented. In a simulation of [[parallax scrolling]], the surface of the Dreadnoughts scrolls horizontally, whereas the [[star]]s in the background stay still.

Since the Commodore 64's graphics do not support parallax scrolling, particular trickery was required to achieve this. The way it was done is that the Dreadnoughts' surface is actually the background, and the black empty space and the stars are character glyphs on the foreground. As the Commodore 64's graphics chip scrolls the screen to the left or right, the character glyphs representing the stars change shape by shifting their single lit pixels to the right or left, countering the scroll of the screen and giving the impression they were stationary.<ref>Hytönen, Pasi: ''Uridiumin ja Parallaxin grafiikka''.

==Sequels==
''Uridium'' was followed by ''Uridium+'' (a modified version containing new levels), and ''[[Uridium 2]]'' on the [[Amiga]] platform.

One of [[Andrew Braybrook]]'s later releases, ''[[Morpheus (1987 video game)|Morpheus]]'', contained a homing mine enemy called an "Uridimine", as a tribute to the homing mines of Uridium. Some aficionados refer to the homing mines as "Uridimines" when talking about ''Uridium'' or ''Uridium 2'', as well.
