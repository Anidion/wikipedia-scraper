'''''Trailblazer''''' is a [[Racing game|racing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Magnetic Fields (video game developer)|Mr. Chip Software]] and published by [[Gremlin Graphics]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 16]] and [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]] in 1986 (there was also an enhanced version on Amstrad CPC 3" disc). It was ported to the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]].

In 2005 a remake for the [[Gizmondo]] was released,<ref>{{cite magazine|title =The Making Of... Trailblazer and Cosmic Causeway |date =May 2010 |url =https://archive.org/details/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_076/page/86/mode/2up |magazine =[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher =[[Imagine Publishing]] |last =Grannell |first =Craig |issue =76 |pages =86–89}}</ref> and was also adapted in 2011 for the [[PS3]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PS Vita]] and [[PlayStation TV]] as part of the ''[[PlayStation mini|Playstation Mini]]'' series.

The game received a direct sequel titled ''[[Cosmic Causeway: Trailblazer II]]'' in 1987.

==Gameplay==

''Trailblazer'' is a [[racing game]] which players play as a soccer ball along a series of suspended passages. The game can be played either in [[time trial]] or [[arcade game|arcade]] mode and four track. The races usually last between 15 and 45 seconds. Special fields on the track let the ball jump (blue), slow down (red), speed up (green) or warp speed the ball (white), invert the controls (cyan/light blue), bounce it backwards (purple) or are holes (black).

== Development ==
Shaun Southern had made some great games for the [[Commodore 16]] before he moved onto the [[Amiga]] and the game was inspired by the arcade game ''[[Metrocross]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Retro Gamer Team |date=2008-08-27 |title=Trailblazer |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/trailblazer/ |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=Retro Gamer |language=en-US}}</ref>
