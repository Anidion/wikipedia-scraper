'''''Gladiator''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Ougon no Shiro'''''|黄金の城|lit. "Golden Castle"}}, is an [[arcade video game]] developed by [[Allumer]] and published in 1986 by [[Taito]].<ref name="klov"/> It was followed by a sequel titled ''[[Blandia]]''. Home ports of ''Gladiator'' were released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Commodore 64]] as '''''Great Gurianos'''''; the Spectrum version was intentionally made [[unwinnable]].<ref name="Dave"/>

==Gameplay==

The player controls a [[gladiator]]/[[knight]] named Great Gurianos as he walks through a [[castle]].<ref name="klov"/> The [[joystick]] direction moves the character left and right and raises his shield up and down. The game's three buttons correspond to a high, medium, and low attack with Great Gurianos's sword.<ref name="klov"/> Gladiator consists of four [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The reward for completing the game is a fifth stage, the "Treasure Place".

Gameplay is split between two modes; in the "obstacle" mode, Great Gurianos walks forward, and the player must use the [[sword]] and [[shield]] to defend him from [[bat]]s, [[fire]]balls, [[arrow]]s, [[shuriken]], and other flying hazards. The "obstacle" mode is broken up by a "fight" mode, in which Great Gurianos must fight against another, similarly armored knight. In both modes, an undefended hit to Great Gurianos knocks off part of his [[armour|armor]] (his [[helmet]] for a high hit, his breastplate for a middle hit, and his leggings for a low hit), and a subsequent hit to the same area kills him.<ref name="klov"/> The character can generate a temporary force field during the obstacle course phases (when weapons and bats fly at him) by rapidly moving the shield up and down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=211 |title=Gladiator |last=Dean |first=Michael |publisher=Classic Gaming |accessdate=3 Oct 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005021451/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=211 |archivedate=2013-10-05}}</ref> During the combat phases, Great Gurianos can become invincible (flashing golden) for a short time.<ref name="klov"/>
