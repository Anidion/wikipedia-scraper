'''''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels''''' (originally '''''Super Mario Bros. 2''''',{{nihongo foot||スーパーマリオブラザーズ2|Sūpā Mario Burazāzu Tsū|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} also known as '''''Super Mario Bros. 2: For Super Players''''') is a 1986 [[platform game]] developed by [[Nintendo R&D4]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. A sequel to ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985), the game was originally released in Japan for the [[Family Computer Disk System]] as ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' on June 3, 1986. [[Nintendo of America]] deemed it too difficult for its North American audience and instead released an alternative sequel, also titled ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', in 1988. The game was renamed ''The Lost Levels'' and first released internationally in the 1993 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] compilation ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]''. The game has since been [[Porting of video games|ported]] to the [[Game Boy Color]] and [[Game Boy Advance]], along with being re-released through [[Emulator|emulation]] for the [[Wii]], [[Wii U]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], and [[Nintendo Switch]].

''The Lost Levels'' is similar to its predecessor in style and gameplay, with players controlling [[Mario]] or [[Luigi]] to rescue [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser]]. The game adds a greater level of difficulty and Luigi controls slightly differently from Mario, with reduced ground friction and increased jump height. ''The Lost Levels'' also introduces obstacles such as poison [[Super Mario#Mushrooms|mushroom]] [[power-up]]s, counterproductive [[level warp]]s, and mid-air wind gusts. The game has 32 [[Level (video games)|levels]] across eight worlds and 20 bonus levels.

Reviewers viewed ''The Lost Levels'' as an extension of the previous game, especially its difficulty progression. Journalists appreciated the game's challenge when spectating [[Speedrunning|speedruns]] and recognized the game as a precursor to the franchise's [[Kaizo]] subculture in which fans create and share [[ROM hacks]] featuring nearly impossible levels. This sequel gave Luigi his first character traits and introduced the poison mushroom item, which has since been used throughout the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]]. ''The Lost Levels'' was the most popular game on the [[Famicom Disk System|Disk System]], for which it sold about 2.5 million copies. It is remembered among the [[Nintendo hard|most difficult Nintendo games]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Super Mario Bros. 2 (Lost Levels).png|frame|left|Screenshot of gameplay from the 1986 Japanese release, showing a poison mushroom|alt=Mario, viewed in profile, faces to the right of the screen, with question mark blocks and a dark mushroom floating overhead and a green pipe in the ground nearby. The screen is mostly blue sky.]]

''The Lost Levels'' is a 2D [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] similar in style and gameplay to the original 1985 ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', save for an increase in difficulty.{{r|IGN: review|IGN: history|Polygon: WUVC|AllGame: SMB2}} As in the original, [[Mario]] (or [[Luigi]]) ventures to rescue the [[Princess Peach|Princess]] from [[Bowser]].{{r|Polygon: WUVC}} The player jumps between platforms, avoids enemies and obstacles, finds secrets (such as [[warp (video games)|warp zones]] and vertical vines) and collects [[power-up]]s such as the [[Mushroom (Mario)|mushroom]] (which makes Mario grow), the [[Super Mario#Projectile flowers|Fire Flower]] (which lets Mario throw fireballs), and the [[Super Mario#Invincibility|Invincibility Star]].{{r|IGN: review}} Unlike the original, there is no two-player mode,{{r|Eurogamer review}} but at the [[title screen]] the player chooses between Mario or Luigi. Their abilities are differentiated for the first time: Luigi, designed for skilled players, has a longer time accelerating and slowing down, but has a higher jump height,{{r|IGN: review}} while Mario is the opposite; he has a faster time accelerating and slowing down, but has a lower jump height.{{r|Eurogamer review}}

''The Lost Levels'' continues the difficulty progression from ''Super Mario Bros''.{{r|IGN: review}} It introduces obstacles including poison mushrooms, [[Level (video gaming)|level]] warps that set the player farther back in the game, and gusts that redirect the player midair.{{r|IGN: history}} The poison mushroom, in particular, works as an anti-mushroom, shrinking or killing the player character.{{r|gamespot review}} Some [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] require "split-second" precision{{r|IGN: history}} and others require the player to jump on invisible blocks.{{r|1001 Must Play}} There were also some graphical changes,{{r|AllGame: SMB2|IGN: Building}} though their soundtracks are identical.{{r|IGN: review}} After each boss fight, [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]] tells Mario that [[Our princess is in another castle!|"[their] princess is in another castle"]].{{r|IGN: history}} The main game has 32 levels{{r|Atari HQ: SMB2}} across eight worlds and five [[bonus stage|bonus]] worlds. A hidden World 9 is accessible if the player does not use a warp zone. Bonus worlds A through D are accessible when the player plays through the game eight times, for a total of 52 levels.{{r|IGN: review}}

The original ''Super Mario Bros.'' was released in North America in October 1985. When developing a version of the game for Nintendo's [[amusement arcade|coin-operated arcade machine]], the [[Nintendo VS. System|VS. System]], the team experimented with new, challenging level designs. They enjoyed these new levels, and thought that ''Super Mario'' devotees would too.{{r|Mush King int}} [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], who created the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]] and directed ''Super Mario Bros.'',<!--not in source but easily cited if needed--> no longer had time to design games by himself, given his responsibilities leading [[Nintendo]]'s [[Nintendo R&D4|R&D4]] division and their work on ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986).{{r|IGN: history}} The ''Super Mario'' sequel was delegated to its predecessor's assistant director, [[Takashi Tezuka]], as his directorial debut.{{r|BossFightBook: lost|NES Mini interview}} He worked with Miyamoto and the R&D4 team{{r|IGN: fav|IGN: review}} to develop a sequel based on the same [[game engine|underlying technology]],{{r|gamespot review}} including some levels directly from ''[[Vs. Super Mario Bros.]]''{{r|IGN: history}}

''The Lost Levels'', originally released in Japan as ''Super Mario Bros. 2''{{r|Polygon: WUVC}} on June 3, 1986, was similar in style to ''Super Mario Bros.'' but much more difficult in gameplay{{snd}}"nails-from-diamonds hard", as Jon Irwin described it in [[Boss Fight Books|his book on the sequels]].{{r|BossFightBook: lost}} Tezuka felt that Japanese players had mastered the original game, and so needed a more challenging sequel.{{r|BossFightBook: lost}} Recognizing that the game might be too difficult for newcomers, the team labeled the game's packaging: "For Super Players".{{r|Mush King int}} They also added a trick to earn [[infinite lives]] as preparation for the game's difficulty.{{r|Mush King int}} Commercials for ''The Lost Levels'' in Japan featured players failing at the game and screaming in frustration at their television.{{r|BossFightBook: lost}} After ''Zelda'', ''The Lost Levels'' was the ninth release for the [[Famicom Disk System]], an add-on external disk drive with more spacious and less expensive disks than the Famicom cartridges.{{r|IGN: history}}

{{Quote box|width=30em|quote=As I continued to play, I found that ''Super Mario Bros.{{spaces}}2'' asked me again and again to take a [[leap of faith]], and each of those leaps resulted in my immediate death. This was not a fun game to play. It was punishment{{snd}}''undeserved'' punishment. I put down my controller, astonished that [[Shigeru Miyamoto|Mr. Miyamoto]] had chosen to design such a painful game.|source=[[Howard Phillips (video gaming)|Howard Phillips]] on his test playthrough of ''The Lost Levels''{{r|BossFightBook: lost}}}}

When evaluated for release outside of Japan, [[Nintendo of America]] believed ''The Lost Levels'' was too difficult and frustrating for the recovering American market and declined its release.{{r|IGN: history|Kotaku: speedrunning}} [[Howard Phillips (video gaming)|Howard Phillips]], who evaluated games for Nintendo of America President [[Minoru Arakawa]], felt that the game was unfairly difficult, even beyond the unofficial moniker of "[[Nintendo Hard]]" that the company's other games sometimes garnered.{{r|BossFightBook: lost}} His opinion was that ''The Lost Levels'' would not sell well in the American market.{{r|IGN: fav|BossFightBook: lost}} He later recalled that "few games were more stymieing. Not having fun is bad when you're a company selling fun".{{r|BossFightBook: lost}}

Nintendo instead released a retrofitted version of [[Fujisankei Communications Group]]'s ''Doki Doki Panic'' as the region's ''[[Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;2]]'' in October 1988.{{r|Kotaku: coming to America}} ''Doki Doki Panic'' had originally been developed by [[Kensuke Tanabe]]. Tanabe was instructed to use characters from ''Yūme Kojo '87'' and was released in Japan as a standalone game on July 10, 1987. ''Doki Doki Panic''{{'}}s characters and artwork were modified to match ''Super Mario Bros.'' before being released in America, and the re-skinned release became known as the "big aberration" in the ''Super Mario'' series.{{r|IGN: history}} The American ''Super Mario Bros.{{spaces}}2'' was later released in Japan as ''Super Mario USA''.{{r|Kotaku: coming to America}}

Nintendo "cleaned up" parts of the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros.{{spaces}}2'' and released it in later ''Super Mario'' collections as ''The Lost Levels''.{{r|IGN: history}} Its North American debut in the 1993 ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' collection for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]{{r|Polygon: WUVC}} featured updated graphics (including increased visibility for the poison mushroom{{r|Eurogamer review}}) and more frequent checkpoints to [[saved game|save player progress]].{{r|gamespot review}} According to ''All-Stars'' developers, the compilation was created because Miyamoto felt ''The Lost Levels'' had not reached a wide audience and wanted more players to experience it.{{r|Iwata: Updating}} ''All-Stars'' was rereleased as a Limited Edition for the Nintendo [[Wii]] console in remembrance of ''Super Mario Bros.''{{'s}} 25th anniversary in 2010.{{r|Kotaku: coming to America}} ''The Lost Levels'' was edited to fit the handheld [[Game Boy Color]] screen as an unlockable bonus in the 1999 ''[[Super Mario Bros. Deluxe]]'': the visible screen is cropped and some features are omitted, such as the wind and five bonus worlds.{{r|Nintendo Life: SMB DX rev|USgamer: greatest}} ''The Lost Levels'' was rereleased in 2004 for the [[Game Boy Advance]] on the third volume of Nintendo's Japan-only [[Famicom Mini]] compilation cartridges.{{r|IGN: mini}}

Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] digital platform introduced North America and Europe to the unedited 1986 Japanese release.{{r|IGN: review|Eurogamer review}} ''The Lost Levels'' was released for multiple Nintendo platforms: the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007 (partially in support of Nintendo's Hanabi Festival{{r|Eurogamer review}}), the [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]]'s in 2012,{{r|Nintendo Life: WU rev|IGN: review}} the [[Wii&nbsp;U]]'s in 2013,{{r|Nintendo Life: WU rev}} and the [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]]'s [[Nintendo Switch Online#Legacy games service|NES catalog]] in 2019.{{r|Variety: Switch}} Nintendo's 2014 classic game compilations ''[[NES Remix 2]]'' (Wii U) and ''[[Ultimate NES Remix]]'' (3DS) included selections from ''The Lost Levels''.{{r|IGN: Remix 2}}{{r|IGN: Ult Remix}} For the series' 35th anniversary, in late 2020, Nintendo included ''The Lost Levels'' in [[Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros.|a limited edition Game & Watch device]].<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=Cameron |title=Here's a better look at the Game & Watch handheld launching in November |work=[[The Verge]] |date=2020-09-10 |url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430625/game-and-watch-nintendo-super-mario-bros-35th-anniversary-handheld-console-closer-look |access-date=2020-11-15 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Watts |first1=Steve |title=Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros.

At the time of its release, ''The Lost Levels'' topped ''[[Famitsu|Famicom Tsūshin]]''{{'s}} charts.{{r|BossFightBook: lost}} The game was the most popular game on the Disk System, for which it sold about 2.5{{spaces}}million copies.{{r|Atari HQ: SMB2}} Retrospective critics viewed ''The Lost Levels'' as an expansion<!--or update--> of the original,{{r|IGN: review|Atari HQ: SMB2|AllGame: SMB2|Eurogamer review}} akin to extra challenge levels tacked on its end.{{r|IGN: review}} Despite their similarities, the sequel is distinguished by its notorious difficulty.{{r|Nintendo Life: WU rev}} ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]'' summarized the game as both "familiar and mysterious" and "simply rather unfair".{{r|1001 Must Play}} ''The Lost Levels'' replaced the original's accessible level designs with "insanely tough obstacle courses"{{r|IGN: history}} as if designed to intentionally frustrate and punish players beginning with its first poison mushroom.{{r|IGN: 125|Nintendo Life: WU rev|IGN: review}}

Retrospective reviewers recommended the game for those who mastered the original, or those who would appreciate a painful challenge.{{r|Nintendo Life: WU rev|Eurogamer review|GameZone: Does It Hold Up?}} Casual ''Mario'' fans, ''GameZone'' wrote, would not find much to enjoy.{{r|GameZone: Does It Hold Up?}} ''[[Nintendo Life]]''{{'s}} reviewer felt that while the original was designed for recklessness, its sequel taught patience, and despite its difficulty, remained both "fiendishly clever" and fun.{{r|Nintendo Life: WU rev}} On the other hand, ''[[GamesRadar]]'' felt that the game was an unoriginal, boring retread, and apart from its "pointlessly cruel" difficulty, not worthy of the player's time.{{r|GamesRadar: Mario best and worst}} ''GamesRadar'' and ''[[IGN]]'' agreed with Nintendo of America's choice against releasing the harder game in the 1980s,{{r|GamesRadar: Mario best and worst|IGN: review}} though ''[[Eurogamer]]'' thought that ''The Lost Levels'' was "technically a much better game" than the ''Doki Doki Panic''-based ''Super Mario Bros.{{spaces}}2'' the American market received instead.{{r|Eurogamer review}}

''The Lost Levels'' is remembered among the most difficult games by Nintendo and in the video game medium.{{r|GamesRadar: Nintendo Hard|USgamer: hardest}} Three decades after the game's release, ''Kotaku'' wrote that the demanding player precision required in ''The Lost Levels'' made fast playthroughs ([[speedruns]]) "remarkably fun" to spectate.{{r|Kotaku: speedrunning}} ''NES Remix 2'' (2014), a compilation for the Wii U, similarly segmented ''The Lost Levels'' into speedrun challenges, which made the challenging gameplay more palatable.{{r|IGN: Remix 2}} Many years after the release of ''The Lost Levels'', fans of the series would [[ROM hacking|modify]] ''Mario'' games to challenge each other with nearly impossible levels. The challenges of ''The Lost Levels'' presaged this [[Kaizo]] community, and according to ''IGN'', ''The Lost Levels'' shares more in common with this subculture than with the Mario series itself.{{r|IGN: review}} Indeed, the sequel is remembered as a [[black sheep]] in the franchise{{r|1001 Must Play|Nintendo Life: WU rev}} and a reminder of imbalanced gameplay in Nintendo's history.{{r|1001 Must Play}}

Luigi received his first distinctive character traits in ''The Lost Levels'': less ground friction, and the ability to jump farther.{{r|IGN: history}} ''IGN'' considered this change to be the game's most significant, though the controls remained "cramped" and "crippled" with either character.{{r|IGN: review}} The game's poison mushroom item, with its character-impairing effects, became a staple of the ''Mario'' franchise.{{refn|name=poison|Games that featured the mushroom include ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' (1992),{{r|Nintendo Life: Mario Kart|GamesRadar: Kart}} ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'' (2004),{{r|GameSpot: Thousand-Year}} ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' (2005),{{r|GamesRadar: galactic}} ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]'' (2007),{{r|Nintendo Life: Mario Kart}} ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' (2011),{{r|Kotaku: poison}} and ''[[Mario Party: Star Rush]]'' (2016).{{r|NWR: Star Rush}} It also appears in Mario-themed games outside the franchise, such as ''[[Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros. Edition]]''{{r|GameZone: Puzzle & Dragons}} and the Wii{{spaces}}U version of ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament 2]]''.{{r|IGN: TTT2}}|group=lower-alpha}} Some of the ''Lost Levels'' appeared in [[All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros.|a 1986 promotional release of ''Super Mario Bros.'']], in which Nintendo modified in-game assets to fit themes from the Japanese radio show ''[[All Night Nippon]]''.{{r|Engadget: Nippon}} Journalists have ranked ''The Lost Levels'' among the least important in the ''Mario'' series{{r|USgamer: greatest Mario|GI: ranking Mario}} and of Nintendo's top games.{{r|IGN: 125}}
