'''''Sweevo's World''''' is an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[arcade adventure]] game released by [[Gargoyle Games]] in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. An enhanced version for the Spectrum 128K was also released, titled ''Sweevo's Whirled''. The game was followed by a sequel, ''[[Hydrofool]]''.

The game was partially inspired by the [[Laurel and Hardy]] films, with Sweevo modelled on [[Stan Laurel]].

==Plot==
The artificial [[Minor planet|planetoid]] Knutz Folly has been overrun by the bizarre genetic experiments of the mad Baron Knutz. It's up to the robot SWEEVO (Self Willed Extreme Environment Vocational Organism)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/s/SweevosWorld.txt|title=Sweevo's World|last=|first=|date=|website=World of Spectrum|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> to clean the place up and thereby achieve Active Status.

==Gameplay==
Sweevo must find and destroy the malfunctioning Waste Ingestion and Janitor Units ("Wijus") that are supposed to keep Knutz Folly clean, while avoiding various hostile creatures and structures. Among the other characters inhabiting Knutz Folly are the Goose Which Laid The Golden [[Erg]] (sic), the Horrible Little Girls ("Minxes"), and the Goose-Stepping Dictators. "[[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownies]]" may be collected for additional ''[[brownie points]]''.

Sweevo cannot jump and must rely on elevators to climb obstacles. He is not armed but can kill enemies by dropping objects on them or manoeuvring them into traps.
