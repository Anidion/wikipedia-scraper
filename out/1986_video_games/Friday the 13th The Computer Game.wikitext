'''''Friday the 13th:  The Computer Game''''' (often shortened to '''''Friday the 13th''''') is the first game adaptation based on the films of the same name. It was released in 1986 by Domark for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].<ref name="IGN"/> The game was released on [[Floppy disk#5.C2.BC-inch floppy disk|floppy diskette]] and [[Compact Cassette#Data recording|cassette tape]]. The player's goal is to find and kill [[Jason Voorhees|Jason]], while making sure their friends or they themselves are not killed by Jason.

==Gameplay==
The player can roam freely around the scenery and walk both inside and outside buildings. Jason, as well as other characters, do the same. It is the player's task to make sure their friends do not get killed by Jason, who often appears disguised as one of them, unless he is hit once and becomes visible as a man dressed in black.<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering the 'Friday the 13th' Video Game That Time Forgot|url=http://halloweenlove.com/remembering-the-friday-the-13th-video-game-that-no-one-remembers/|access-date=October 10, 2016|date=August 21, 2014|author=John Squires}}</ref> Various improvised weapons (e.g., a [[Chainsaws in popular culture|chainsaw]], a [[pitchfork]], a [[machete]], etc.) are scattered around the camp and inside various buildings such as a barn, a church and a cabin. Once picked up, they can be used to confront Jason.<ref name="Bloomsbury ">{{cite book|pages= 45, 223, 224 443|title=The World of Scary Video Games: A Study in Videoludic Horror|author=Bernard Perron|isbn=978-1501316197|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Academic]]|year=2018}}</ref> There are five levels in the game and each time the player assumes the role of another character. The character assignment is random at the start of the round.<ref name="Bloomsbury"/> The game uses an early [[pseudo-3D]] view along with a more traditional side view, depending on the character's location.<ref name="Bloomsbury"/> The game also features a "fear meter", in the form of a [[Blonde hair|blonde]] woman's head with [[Goose bumps|hair standing on end]], to symbolize the player character's level of fright at the time.<ref name="Bloomsbury"/><ref name="Perron"/> Unlike the later [[Friday the 13th (1989 video game)|Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)]] title, the game included scenes of [[Splatter film|gore]] consistent with the film franchise.<ref name="Bloomsbury"/> For example, when a character is killed by Jason, sometimes there is a scream followed by a [[Jump cut|quick cut]] to a graphic image of a machete embedded into their head.<ref name="C64"/><ref name="Bloomsbury"/>

==Development==
Domark based the game on ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title =D-D-Domark's N-N-New G-G-Game...

In the cellar of the pub, Dominic Wheatley, co-founder of Domark burst through a solid door dressed as Jason and holding a cleaver, scaring the assembled journalists.<ref>{{cite magazine|title =Domarketting a Game |date =June 1986 |url =https://archive.org/details/crash-magazine-29/page/n49/mode/2up |magazine =[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |publisher =[[Newsfield|Newsfield Limited]] |issue =29 |page =51 |issn=0954-8661}}</ref> According to ''[[The Games Machine]]'', some magazines refused to run ads for the game due to the game's graphic packaging;<ref name=machinemassacre /> ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' ran ads for the game and prominently featured Jason Voorhees on the cover of issue #23, which caused the magazine to receive many complaints from parents, including one woman who also wrote to the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]] about the incident.<ref>{{cite magazine|title =Lloyd Mangram's Forum |date =February 1986 |url =https://archive.org/details/Crash_Magazine_025/page/30/mode/2up |magazine =[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |publisher =[[Newsfield|Newsfield Limited]] |last =Mangram |first =Lloyd |issue =25 |pages =31, 32|issn=0954-8661}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' described the game's advertising as being "the subject of much controversy";<ref name=yourcomputerspectrum /> in March 1986 it was reported that ads for ''Friday the 13th'' were withdrawn by Domark due to complaints about their violent content, and the cover was redesigned.<ref>{{cite magazine|title =Gremlin |date =March 1986 |url =https://archive.org/details/Sinclair_User_048/page/114/mode/2up |magazine =[[Sinclair User]] |publisher =[[EMAP|EMAP Business & Computer Publications]]|issue =48 |page =114|issn=0262-5458}}</ref> Another redesigned version of the cover was used for copies sold at [[John Menzies]] stores,<ref name=machinemassacre /><ref name=tooviolent /> omitting the knife.<ref>{{cite magazine|title =Censored! |date =July 1989 |url =https://archive.org/details/The_Games_Machine_Issue_020/page/54/mode/2up |magazine =[[The Games Machine]] |publisher =[[Newsfield|Newsfield Limited]] |issue =20 |pages =54, 55 |issn=0954-8092}}</ref>

In regards to the game's controversial marketing and the criticism that children can buy the game, Dominic Wheatley stated that "Many X-rated films are accompanied by books which are often more vivid in their descriptions and yet under 18s can buy those. We are trying to amuse people — ''Friday the 13th'' will not incite anyone to run around and hurt someone."<ref name=tooviolent>{{cite magazine|title =Friday 13: too violent |date =January 1986 |url =https://archive.org/details/Sinclair_User_046/page/6/mode/2up |magazine =[[Sinclair User]] |publisher =[[EMAP|EMAP Business & Computer Publications]] |issue =56 |page =7|issn=0262-5458 }}</ref>

The game came packaged with two capsules of [[Theatrical blood|fake blood]],<ref name=CVGreview /> which was omitted when [[Prism Leisure]] re-released the game as a budget title.<ref name=machinemassacre>{{cite magazine|title =The Chainstore Massacre |date =February 1988 |url =https://archive.org/details/The_Games_Machine_Issue_003/page/n91/mode/2up |magazine =[[The Games Machine]] |publisher =[[Newsfield|Newsfield Limited]] |last =Gilbert |first =John |issue =3 |pages =93, 94|issn=0954-8092}}</ref> To promote the game, Domark ran a trivia contest in ''[[Amtix]]'' magazine, with two winners receiving a "[[ghost hunting]]" trip to New York.<ref>{{cite magazine|title =Aaaaarrrgh!!! |date =December 1985 |url =https://archive.org/details/Amtix_Magazine_Issue_02/page/46/mode/2up |magazine =[[Amtix]] |publisher =[[Newsfield|Newsfield Limited]] |last =Spencer |first =Jeremy |issue =2 |pages =46–48|issn=0952-3022}}</ref> In a 1987 interview, Mark Strachan, co-founder of Domark, called the game "something I'd rather forget about", and said that the game's quality issues stemmed from being made by inexperienced programmers.<ref>{{cite magazine|title =Mark Strachan - The man who put Mark into Domark |date =February 1987 |url =https://archive.org/details/Amtix_Magazine_Issue_16/page/n79/mode/2up |magazine =[[Amtix]] |publisher =[[Newsfield|Newsfield Limited]] |last =Eddy |first =Richard |issue =16 |pages =80, 81|issn=0952-3022}}</ref>

The game's main appeal was the obvious horror elements, which included atmospheric music and digitized screams.<ref name="Perron">{{cite book|title=Horror Video Games: Essays on the Fusion of Fear and Play|page=33|editor=Bernard Perron|publisher=[[McFarland Press|McFarland]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0786441976}}</ref><ref name="C64">{{cite web|title=Friday the 13th for Commodore 64|date=December 1, 2014|author=Judge Greg|access-date=October 10, 2016|url=http://www.enthusiacs.com/the-attic-friday-the-13th-for-commodore-64/}}</ref> Some criticized that it changed elements from the franchise, such as Jason being dressed all in black, which has nothing in common with his appearance from the movies.<ref name="C64"/>

The game received otherwise negative reviews, regardless of the platform. ''[[Zzap!64]]'' gave it 13%,<ref name=zzapreview /> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' gave it 3/10,<ref name=sinclairreview /> ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' 32%<ref name=crashreview /> and ''[[Sinclair User]]'' 4/10.

In 1987, ''Crash'' called ''Friday the 13th'' "one of the worst tie-ins ever".<ref name=releasedate />
