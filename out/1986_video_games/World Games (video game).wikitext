Writing for ''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'', Benn Dunnington gave the Commodore 64 version of ''World Games'' three-plus stars out of five and described it as "my least favorite of the series". Stating that slalom skiing was the best event, he concluded that "Epyx does such a nice, consistent job of execution, tho, that it's hard to take off too many points even for such boring material".<ref name="info198701">{{Cite magazine |last1=Dunnington |first1=Benn |last2=Brown |first2=Mark R. |last3=Malcolm |first3=Tom |date=January–February 1987 |title=64/128 Gallery |url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n13/mode/2up |magazine=Info |pages=14–21}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s Rick Teverbaugh criticized the slalom skiing and log rolling events' difficulty, but concluded that "World Games is still a must for the avid sports games".<ref name="teverbaugh198703">{{cite news | title=Sports Scoreboard | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=March 1987 | author=Teverbaugh, Rick | pages=14}}</ref> [[Charles Ardai]] called the game "an adequate sequel" to Epyx's previous ''Games'', and praised the graphics. He criticized the mechanics "as bizarre little joystick patterns which have little to do with the events" but still recommended the game because of the log rolling event.<ref name="ardai198704">{{cite news | title=Titans of the Computer Gaming World / Part 1 of V: Ardai on Epyx | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=April 1987 | last=Ardai | first=Charles | authorlink=Charles Ardai | pages=12}}</ref> Jame Trunzo praised the game's use of advanced graphics and sound, including humorous effects. Also noted was the variety in the included games, preventing the game from getting too repetitive.<ref name = "CGW">{{Cite news | date = Apr 1988 | last = Trunzo | first = James | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Spanning the Globe...

The game was reviewed in 1988 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon132">{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk |journal=Dragon |issue=132 |date=April 1988 |pages=80–85}}</ref>
