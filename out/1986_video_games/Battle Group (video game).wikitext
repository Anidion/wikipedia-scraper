Jay Selover reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Just as the title of the game is a translation of the earlier title, the game itself is basically a translation. The system, mechanics, and design are straight from ''Kampfgruppe''; and here even the "feel" of the combat is still very World War II-ish."<ref name="CGW29">{{cite magazine |last=Selover |first=Jay |title=''Battlegroup'' & ''Mech Brigade'' |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |date=June–July 1986 |volume=1 |issue=29 |pages=10–11, 43}}</ref> ''[[Commodore Microcomputers]]'' named ''Battle Group'' one of the top computer wargames of 1986.<ref name=microcomputers>{{cite journal | title=The Best of 1986; The Best of War Games | author=Seiken, Jeff | date=November–December 1986 | journal=[[Commodore Microcomputers]] | number=6 | volume=7 | page=131 }}</ref>
