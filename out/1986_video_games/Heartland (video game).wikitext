'''''Heartland''''' is a [[platform game]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Commodore 64]] released by [[Odin Computer Graphics]] in 1986.

==Plot==
The Heartland has fallen under the rule of the ruthless tyrant Midan and his minions. To overthrow him, the final six pages of a magical book must be found and assembled. However, to confuse would-be adventurers Midan has created six evil pages; these must also be destroyed.

==Gameplay==
The game is very similar to the earlier Odin titles ''[[Nodes of Yesod]]'' and ''[[Arc of Yesod]]''. The player must locate the six magical pages and also destroy the six dark pages. Various spells may be collected, including a magical hat which may be thrown to kill enemies. Knives and fireballs can also be used to attack enemies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/18420/Heartland/|title = Heartland - Software - Game - Computing History}}</ref> Contact with enemies will cause the player to lose energy; as he grows weaker the face of Midan gradually appears at the top of the screen.

Simple without being simple-minded."<ref name="Sinclair User Review"/> [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] reviewed the game stating "This is a very nice game. The graphics are fabulous, and the animation is really rather neat and the game itself is very attractively designed. Playability-wise, Heartland is very good indeed, and it’s also addictive. Lots of things combine to make this one of the better games on the Spectrum".<ref name=Crash1/>
