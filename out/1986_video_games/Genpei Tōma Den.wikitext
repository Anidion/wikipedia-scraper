It runs on [[Namco System 86]] hardware. Over a decade later, the game was released in America and Europe in the video game compilation ''[[Namco Museum|Namco Museum Vol. 4]]'' under the title of '''''The Genji and the Heike Clans''''' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].

==Gameplay==

''Genpei Tōma Den'' is a side-scrolling [[hack and slash]] platform game. The player controls [[Taira no Kagekiyo]], a [[samurai]] who was killed in the [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]] during the [[Genpei War]]. In this alternate fictional interpretation of history, Kagekiyo was resurrected to defeat his enemy [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] and the heads of his clan, [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]] and [[Benkei|Saito Musashibo Benkei]], who have now thrown Japan into turmoil and turned it into a dangerous realm sprawling with demons under their tyrannical excess.<ref name="HG101">{{cite book |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Hardcore Gaming 101 Digest Vol. 6: Namco Arcade Classics |date=November 26, 2019 |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |isbn=978-1691254194 |pages=60–63}}</ref><ref name="KLOV">{{cite web |title=Genpei ToumaDen - Videogame by Namco |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7930 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=International Arcade Museum |accessdate=17 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325040619/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7930 |archive-date=25 March 2019}}</ref>

The player travels through the Japanese countryside fighting enemies as they appear. The game offers three types of action: Small Mode (standard), Big Mode (standard, but with large characters and usually boss fights) and Plain Mode (viewed from an overhead perspective). Most stages have [[torii]], which are used to transport the player to a different stage. On most stages featured in Side Mode and Plain Mode, there are multiple torii that can be entered which will lead to different routes on the map. In Big Mode, however, there is only one torii at the end of this type of stage. The game also features the [[Sanzu River]], a place believed in [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] to separate "the current life" and "the afterlife", resembling the concept of the [[Underworld]] or [[Hell]] (the river is often compared to the river [[Styx]] in [[Greek mythology]]). Therefore, some mythological characters like [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Emma-o]] (閻魔大王; literally "Enma Dai-o"), god of the Underworld, appear in the game.

==Release==
The game's first port was released in 1988 for the Japanese [[Sharp X68000]] home computer. The game was also ported to the [[PC Engine]] and released on March 16, 1990. The PC Engine version was also released for the [[Wii Virtual Console]].

''Genpei Tōma Den'' was also featured on the ''[[Namco Museum|Namco Museum Vol. 4]]'' compilation game for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], released in 1996 in Japan and 1997 in North America and Europe. For the U.S. and European releases, the game was re-titled as ''The Genji and the Heike Clans''. This would be the first time the original ''Genpei Tōma Den'' would make an appearance outside Japan.<ref name="GSpot">{{cite web |last=Gerstmann |first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Gerstmann |title=Namco Museum Volume 4 Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/namco-museum-volume-4-review/1900-2548529/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=30 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730051820/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/namco-museum-volume-4-review/1900-2548529/ |archive-date=30 July 2019 |date=2 May 2000}}</ref> In 2021, it was also released by [[Hamster Corporation]] as part of the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' series for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]].

The character of Kagekiyo won third place in the Best Character award.<ref name="Mook"/> In their 1991 [[Mook (publishing)|mook]] ''The Best Game'', readers voted it as being among the greatest arcade games of all time up to that point. Staff described ''Genpei Tōma Den'' as being "an immortal masterpiece", applauding its visuals, gameplay, soundtrack, and faithfulness to its source material. Its usage of characters such as Yoshitune and Benkei, important figures in the [[Heian period]] of Japan, also received praise.<ref name="Best Game"/>

The PC Engine home release also received positive coverage. The staff of ''[[Famitsu]]'' awarded it the Gold Hall of Fame award and praised its faithfulness to the arcade original, saying that it was "a port that does not spoil the taste of the original".<ref name="Famitsu"/> The magazine ''PC Engine FAN'' reported it as being among the most-popular PC Engine games, with readers voting it as being the 24th best game for the console by 1993.<ref name="PCF"/> In contrast to other reviews, Olivier Scamps felt it was one of the worst games for the console, arguing that the game suffers from bland gameplay and uninteresting action sequences.<ref name="Tilt"/> Zenji Nishikawa of ''Oh!X'' enjoyed the Sharp X68000 version for its inclusion of new levels and secrets, finding it superior to the arcade original.<ref name="OhX">{{cite news |last1=Nishikawa |first1=Zenji |title=THE SOFTOUCH - 源平討魔伝 |url=https://archive.org/details/OhX_1988-06/page/n17/mode/2up?q |accessdate=17 July 2020 |agency=Oh!X |publisher=Japan SoftBank |date=June 1988 |pages=16–17 |language=ja}}</ref>

Outside Japan, ''Genpei Tōma Den'' has received a more mixed reaction from critics. In their review of ''[[Namco Museum|Namco Museum Vol. 4]]'', [[IGN]] stated that it was the strangest of the included games, but felt its side-scrolling gameplay appealed to fans of the genre.<ref>{{cite web |author1=IGN Staff |title=Namco Museum Vol. 4 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/07/18/namco-museum-vol-4 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=17 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429213236/https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/07/18/namco-museum-vol-4 |archive-date=29 April 2019 |date=18 July 1997}}</ref> ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s [[Jeff Gerstmann]] felt otherwise, believing it to be the worst title in any of the ''Namco Museum'' anthologies up to that point. He wrote that: "''The Genji and the Heike Clans'' is a joke. Calling this an arcade classic is preposterous."<ref name="GSpot"/> A reviewer for ''[[PlayStation Official Magazine – UK]]'' compared it unfavorably to Sega's ''[[The Revenge of Shinobi (1989 video game)|The Revenge of Shinobi]]'', criticizing its controls for making the game unreasonably difficult to play and its difficulty for being too high. While the reviewer believed that ''Genpei Tōma Den'' was good as an arcade game, they didn't think it translated well to a home platform.<ref>{{cite news |title=Play Test - Namco Museum Volume 4 |url=https://archive.org/details/opm023/page/n123/mode/2up? |accessdate=17 July 2020 |agency=[[PlayStation Official Magazine – UK]] |issue=23 |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |date=October 1997 |location=United Kingdom |pages=124–125}}</ref>

In 2020, ''Game Watch''{{'}}s Tetsuya Inamoto retrospectively reviewed the PC Engine version of ''Genpei Tōma Den'' through the PC Engine Mini. He applauded the conversion's quality for being on-par with the arcade game, enjoying its "overwhelming" visuals and large character sprites. Inamoto credited the game's success with its presentation and audible voice samples, which had not been done before in arcade games, alongside its usage of real-world figures such as Minamoto no Yoritomo. In addition, he believed that the quality of the port helped establish Namco's reputation for delivering accurate renditions of its arcade games to the console, writing that it "boasts the completeness of one of Namco's PC Engine arcade transplants, which had a reputation from the beginning. It delighted fans."<ref name="GWatch">{{cite web |last1=Inamoto |first1=Tetsuya |title=【PCエンジン mini全タイトルレビュー！】「源平討魔伝」 |url=https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/feature/1239788.html |website=Game Watch |publisher=Impress Group |accessdate=17 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417160146/https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/feature/1239788.html |archive-date=17 April 2020 |language=ja |date=17 March 2020}}</ref>

==Legacy==
===Related games===
In October 1988, Namco released a version of ''Genpei Tōma Den'' for the [[Family Computer]] titled ''Genpei Tōma Den Computer Board Game''. Packaged with a physical cloth game board, cards, and metallic player figures molded after Kagekiyo, it takes the form of a virtual board game where players compete against each other to conqueror all of Japan. Where as ''Genpei Tōma Den'' was a side-scrolling action game, ''Computer Board Game'' is instead a [[role-playing game]], where players engage in battles with enemies and purchase items and equipment from stores. The idea for the game came from Namco designer Yuichiro Shinozaki wanting to further expand on the lore and world of the original game.

A true sequel named ''Genpei Tōma Den: Kan no Ni'' was released in 1992 for the PC Engine. Developed by Namco and [[Now Production]], it was published in North America by [[NEC Corporation]] as ''[[Samurai-Ghost]]''. The game is set after the events of the original, where Kagekiyo is resurrected from the dead to prevent Yoritomo from reviving himself in the heaven world of Makai Nippon. ''Kan no Ni'' omits the Small and Plain mode sections, a move that was largely criticized by players and reviewers. It was re-released through the [[Wii Virtual Console]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Provo |first1=Frank |title=Samurai Ghost Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/samurai-ghost-review/1900-6182318/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=17 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909104155/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/samurai-ghost-review/1900-6182318/ |archive-date=9 September 2014 |date=5 November 2007}}</ref>

===Other appearances in media===
Kagekiyo has made a few appearances in other video games developed by Namco. He became a featured playable character in the [[Wonderswan Color]] game ''[[Namco Super Wars]]''. He also appeared as a playable character in the Japan-only [[role-playing game]] ''[[Namco × Capcom]]'', where he teamed up with [[List of Soul characters#Mitsurugi|Heishirō Mitsurugi]] from the [[Soul (series)|''Soul'' series]] and Tarosuke from ''[[Yokai Dochuki]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bn-ent.net/cs/list/namco_x_capcom/character/|script-title=ja:ナムコ クロス カプコン - キャラクター|language=ja|publisher=Namco × Capcom Website|accessdate=13 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012205347/http://www.bn-ent.net/cs/list/namco_x_capcom/character/|archive-date=12 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, Yoshitsune, Benkei, Yoshinaka and Yoritomo also appeared as bosses. In ''[[Tales of Eternia]]'' (known as ''Tales of Destiny II'' in the U.S.), he appeared in the Aifread's Tomb dungeon, along with Rick Taylor from the [[Splatterhouse|''Splatterhouse'' series]], to prevent the player from advancing through certain doorways. In ''[[Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon]]'', there is a Kagekiyo costume to be worn. Kagekiyo's armor also appears in the character creation mode of ''[[Soulcalibur III]]'', where it is possible to create a character in his likeness. In ''[[Tekken 6]]'', it is possible to customize the character [[List of Tekken characters#Yoshimitsu|Yoshimitsu]] in order to make him similar to Kagekiyo. The series was resurrected as a webcomic, as part of Namco Bandai's [[ShiftyLook]] series, titled ''Scar''. The new webcomic featured cyborg samurais instead of demons. A remixed version of the game music was included in ''[[Ridge Racer V]]''.

A theme based on ''Genpei Tōma Den'', featuring several of the game's characters is featured in ''[[Pac-Man 99]]'', as special DLC.
