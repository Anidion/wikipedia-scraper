''[[Sinclair User]]'' magazine wrote that ''The Boggit'' was "just as funny and sick as its predecessor but is better presented and a whole lot snappier. It's miles better than the game it lampoons too."<ref name="ZX Computing Review">{{cite journal|title=The Boggit |journal=[[Sinclair User]] |issue=August 1986 |first=Richard |last=Price |date=August 1986 |pages=76â€“77 |url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-053/SinclairUser_053_Aug_1986#page/n75/mode/2up}}</ref>
