'''''Army Moves''''' is a [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] game [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Dinamic Software]] for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. It is the first chapter of the ''Moves Trilogy'' and was followed by ''Navy Moves'' in 1987 and ''[[Arctic Moves]]'' in 1995. It was first released in 1986 and published by Dinamic in Spain and by [[Imagine Software]]. Dinamic Software also developed a [[MS-DOS]] version of the game, published in 1989 in [[Spain]].

==Gameplay==
The game contains seven levels that are divided into two main sections. The first four levels make up the first section, where the player has to drive an army unit (jeep or helicopter) through a terrain, steering clear of hostile vehicles.

In the last three levels that comprise the second main section, one plays as a [[soldier]] who shoots enemies along his way. In level 5 the soldier must jump from rock to rock in a river, shooting hostile birds. Thereafter, the soldier makes his way into the enemy headquarters with the goal of retrieving secret documents.

''Army Moves'' was regarded as a rather bad game on the Amiga â€“ "almost non-existent gameplay makes this very poor value for money", according to a review in [[Zzap!64#Zzap.2164|Zzap!]]. It received mixed reviews from [[ZX Spectrum]] magazines and was successful enough in Spain to spawn two follow-ups, ''Navy Moves'' in 1988 and ''[[Arctic Moves]]'' in 1995. The latter appeared only for the [[Personal computer|PC]] platform, and it included the first two chapters of the series, playable through a [[ZX Spectrum]] [[emulator]], as an extra. A fourth entry in the series, ''Desert Moves'' was announced at the end of the game ''[[Arctic Moves]]'', but never appeared.

The game music in non-Spanish versions is based on the [[Colonel Bogey March]].
