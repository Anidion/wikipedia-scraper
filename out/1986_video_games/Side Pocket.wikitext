{{nihongo foot|'''''Side Pocket'''''|サイドポケット|Saido Poketto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[pocket billiards]] simulation released as an [[arcade video game]] by [[Data East]] in 1986. It was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Game Boy]], while an [[enhanced remake]] was later released on the [[Sega Genesis]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], and [[Game Gear]]. The game spawned two sequels, as well as arcade spin-off series titled ''Pocket Gal''.

[[G-Mode]] owns the [[intellectual property]] rights to the ''Side Pocket'' series, and licenses these games globally.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:SidePocketplay.png|thumb|left|Genesis gameplay showing a lit-up pocket]]

The primary play mode, called "Pocket Game", is a [[straight pool]] game set within a limited number of lives; the player must achieve a predetermined score to advance through four or five levels, each with increasing number of [[Billiard ball|ball]]s. The player earns points by potting balls, potting balls on consecutive shots, and potting balls in numerical order. On occasion, a flashing star appear in a pocket, and if the player pots a ball into that pocket in the same shot, a bonus will be awarded in the form of points, extra lives or a bonus round. One life is lost if the player {{Cuegloss|Scratch|''scratches''}} or fails to pot a ball in two consecutive shots.

In the two-player mode, the player can choose between Pocket Game or [[Nine-ball|9-Ball Game]]. In two-player Pocket Game, the game plays similarly, except the two players take turns and there are no lives; if one player misses or scratches, control of the ball simply changes to the other player. In 9-Ball Game, each player has three lives and one life is lost if a {{Cuegloss|Foul|''foul''}} is committed. However, the lives will be restored if the player makes a legal shot on the next turn.

In the [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Gear]] version, there is also an additional practice mode, which is essentially a single-player version of 9-Ball Game.

A variety of [[trick shot]] challenges are also available to the player(s), to earn additional points or extra life, requiring the player pot all balls into select pockets using a single shot. The player may put various spins on the ball, such as left and right {{Cuegloss|English|english}}, and perform {{Cuegloss|Massé|massés}} and {{Cuegloss|Jump shot|jump shots}}.[[File:Side Pocket SNES cover.jpg|right|thumb|North American SNES cover art]]

The Genesis and SNES versions features a photo-realistic representation of the [[Protagonist|player character]]s.  The characters are a [[Easter egg (media)|homage]] to the 1986 billiards-themed film ''[[The Color of Money]]''; with the characters bearing resemblance to Vincent Lauria (played by [[Tom Cruise]]) and Fast Eddie (played by [[Paul Newman]]), the two main characters from the film.

== Ports ==
''Side Pocket'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Game Boy]]. The NES version plays almost identical to the arcade version, but the Pocket Game mode features 4 levels and the player starts with 5 lives, as opposed to 2. The NES version also introduce  four different [[Rack (billiards)|rack]] configuration that become standard in later versions, whereas the arcade version only feature [[Nine-ball#Six-ball|six-ball]] and [[nine-ball]] racks. 

The Game Boy version of ''Side Pocket'' is a slight modification from the NES version, featuring a smaller playing field (to compensate with Game Boy's screen), new set of soundtrack and a different screen layout. Like in NES version, the Pocket Game mode features 4 levels and the player starts with 5 lives. One unique addition to the Game Boy version is the ability to play single-player nine-ball mode, while in other versions this mode is limited only to two players.

== Legacy ==
=== Pocket Gal ===

''Pocket Gal'' is the arcade adaptation of the NES version of ''Side Pocket'' released exclusively for Japan in 1987. Gameplay remains similar to the NES game, although the lesser number of lives makes the game more challenging. It also has different music and sound effects, alongside hidden [[Nudity|explicit imagery]] as rewards for completing certain levels. An English version was also released under the name Pocket Gal 2. There is also another version of the game called ''Super Pool III'' which removes the hidden explicit images. This version was published by I-Vics in North America.<ref>{{cite web |title=Super Pool III title screen |url=http://gaminghell.co.uk/images/pcktgalversions3.png}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Super Pool III cabinet |url=https://r.mprd.se/MAME/cabinets/spool3.png}}</ref>

=== Pocket Gal Deluxe ===
[[Image:Pocket Gal Deluxe pktgaldx icon (240x240).png|thumb|right|90x90px|''Pocket Gal Deluxe'' arcade video game]]
In 1992, a sequel called ''Pocket Gal Deluxe'' was released in Japan and Europe. While the gameplay remains the same, ''Pocket Gal Deluxe'' features revamped graphics, more levels and includes a [[MIDI]]-based [[jazz]] music. Furthermore, ''Pocket Gal Deluxe'' also serve as the basis for the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], and [[Game Gear]] versions of ''Side Pocket''.

This version features completely different contents compared to the original, including revamped graphics, new [[smooth jazz]]-oriented soundtrack, new sound effects and photo-realistic background sceneries during gameplay. The main game modes remain identical to the original, with several alteration on the Pocket Game mode. This mode now features 5 levels represented as "cities" ([[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Las Vegas]], [[New York City]], and [[Atlantic City]]) and the player starts with 8 lives. In addition, a new "trick shot" mode is featured, in which the player can try one of the 19 trick shot levels, each with increasing difficulty. 

The Game Gear port is a stripped-down version of the Genesis version, which plays more akin to the original rendition, more specifically the NES version. However, most elements from the Genesis/SNES version are retained, such as the background images (scaled down to 8-bit), some of the soundtracks, and the trick shot levels.

=== Sequels ===
''[[Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend]]'' expands greatly upon the original game by adding various pool games (including [[eight-ball]], [[straight pool]], and [[one-pocket]]) and the ability to play against [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled players.

''[[Side Pocket 3]]'' uses a [[First-person (video games)|First-person view]].
== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Side Pocket'' on their August 1, 1986 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=289|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 August 1986|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref> It went on to be the eighth highest-grossing table [[1987 in video games|arcade game of 1987]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '87 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=324 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=15 January 1988 |page=20 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19880115p.pdf#page=11}}</ref>

In reviewing the NES version, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' declared it "far and away the best billiards simulation ever published for any system". The features that went beyond realistic pool were especially praised as enhancing the game's play.<ref name="CGW">{{citation | date = July 1988 |last = Kunkell | first = Bill | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title =Video Gaming World: Side Pocket| pages = 45}}</ref>

Reviewing the SNES version, ''[[GamePro]]'' praised the variety of modes, the audio and graphical improvements over the NES version, and the realistic details. They recommended the game "for pool enthusiasts and casual video game pool players alike. There are plenty of great options and genuine pool strategies to keep serious players interested, and yet it's simple enough to play without the manual."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Side Pocket|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=55|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1994|page=121}}</ref> They gave the Game Gear version a more mixed review, commenting that the representation of the player's stick as a stream of balls is needlessly cumbersome, and that the graphics and sound are poor. However, they summarized, "Determining the precise angle and power for a shot can be harder than taking a geometry test, but it's definitely more fun."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Side Pocket|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=60|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=July 1994|page=134}}</ref> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also complained of poor sounds but were more impressed with the graphics, describing them as exceptional for a portable system. They praised the game for its trick shots and generally strategic gameplay and gave it a 6.25 out of 10.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Review Crew: Side Pocket|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=59|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=June 1994|page=40}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the game a B− and wrote that "Insipid electronic lounge sounds are an integral component of ''Side Pocket'' (for Genesis), which presents American pool halls as a series of squeaky-clean (no beer stains on the felt here), nonconfrontational venues where your sole objective is to play pool — and not, say, impress your date with how many shots of tequila you can down in five minutes. Embodying this utilitarian approach is the game's hyper-realistic, overhead-angle table display — not as realistic, unfortunately, is its follow-the-dotted-line aiming system, which allows you to hit the cue ball in only about half a dozen places. An extensive trick-shot menu — apparently meant to compensate for this glaring limitation — is intriguing, but completely superfluous."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1992/10/30/side-pocket/|title = Side Pocket| magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref>

Italian magazine ''Consolmania'', however, gave the Genesis version 80.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Consolemania-014/page/n39|title = Consolemania 014|date = December 1992}}</ref> 

In 1995, [[Total!]] ranked the game 70th on their Top 100 SNES Games writing: "A bit flawed and there are no UK pool rules but in two-player mode this is a real giggle."<ref>{{Cite journal |date=July 1995 |title=Top 100 SNES Games |url=https://archive.org/details/total-43/page/n45/mode/2up |journal=Total! |issue=43 |pages=47 |access-date=February 27, 2022}}</ref> In 1996, [[Super Play]] listed Side Pocket 90th in it’s Top 100 SNES Games of All Time.<ref name="SP42">{{cite magazine |date=April 1996 |title=The Super Play All-time top 100 SNES games |url= |magazine=[[Super Play]] |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |issue=42 |page=}}</ref>
