'''''Rygar''''' is a  [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] created by [[Tecmo]] in 1986 and originally released for [[video arcade|arcades]] in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Argos no Senshi'''''|アルゴスの戦士|Arugosu no Senshi|lit. '''''Warrior of Argus'''''}}.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9386 |title =Rygar |publisher =The International Arcade Museum |access-date =6 Oct 2013}}</ref> The player assumes the role of a "Legendary Warrior", battling through a hostile landscape.

[[Kotaku]], May 20, 2020. Accessed June 28, 2021.</ref>

A remake, ''[[Rygar: The Legendary Adventure]]'', was released in 2002. {{As of|2007|6}}, ''Rygar'' and its remake sold a combined {{nowrap|1.5 million}} copies worldwide.<ref name="tecmofranchises">{{cite web | url=http://www.tecmo.co.jp/company/data/20070823cp_e.pdf#page=13 | title=TECMO Corporate Profile (as of June 2007) | page=12 | format=PDF | access-date=2008-01-07 | publisher=[[Tecmo]] | date=August 23, 2007}}</ref>

==Plot==
The arcade game begins with the following introduction:

{{quote|4.5 billion years have passed since Earth's creation. Many dominators have ruled in all their glory, but time was their greatest enemy and it defeated their reign. And now a new dominator's reign begins...}}

In the arcade version's story, the year 19XX sees the rise of dread creatures, not seen since before the Common Era, led by Ligar. Dominating the world, Ligar and his forces oppress humanity. The only thing that preserves humanity's will to survive is a prophecy that Ligar's rule will be opposed by the return of a long-dead warrior of Argos. That warrior does return to the world of the living, and he alone can save humanity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Retro Game Museum |url=http://arcadefan.web.fc2.com/argos.html |access-date=23 March 2022}}</ref>

Information gleaned from console manuals reveals that the evil being Ligar has taken over the land of Argool, and Rygar, a dead warrior who has risen from his grave, must use his Diskarmor to stop him. In console versions clues and limited dialogue are given in the form of large, sage-like men encountered in green stone temples throughout the game.<ref name=peter/>

In the Japanese original, references to "Ligar" and "Rygar" are one and the same because the Roman syllables "Li" and "Ry" come from the same Japanese character, リ. In this version, the hero is only referred to as "The Legendary Warrior", while both "Rygar" and "Ligar" refer to the main villain.

==Ports==
The game was ported to the [[X68000]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Master System]] (Japan only, and renamed {{nihongo|''Argus no Juujiken''|アルゴスの十字剣}}), [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and the [[Atari Lynx]].  The 8-bit versions were produced by Probe Software. In the [[Atari Lynx]] version some rounds are different, and there are only 23 rounds.

''Rygar'' is included in a compilation of games called ''[[Tecmo Classic Arcade]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. The arcade version was re-released on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]].

==Related Famicom/NES game==
''Rygar'', released in Japan as {{nihongo|''Warrior of Argus: Extreme Great Charge''|アルゴスの戦士 はちゃめちゃ大進撃|Arugosu no Senshi: Hachamecha Daishingeki}} is a [[fantasy]]-themed [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[platform game]] with [[Action role-playing game|action RPG]] elements developed by [[Tecmo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Famicom]].<ref name="cgw_76">{{citation|first=Roe R.|last=Adams|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=November 1990|issue=76|pages=83–84|title=Westward Ho! (Toward Japan, That Is): An Overview of the Evolution of CRPGs on Dedicated Game Machines|quote=While America has been concentrating on yet another ''Wizardry'', ''Ultima'', or ''Might & Magic'', each bigger and more complex than the one before it, the Japanese have slowly carved out a completely new niche in the realm of CRPG. The first CRPG entries were ''Rygar'' and ''Deadly Towers'' on the NES. These differed considerably from the "action adventure" games that had drawn quite a following on the machines beforehand. Action adventures were basically arcade games done in a fantasy setting such as ''Castlevania'', ''Trojan'', and ''Wizards & Warriors''. The new CRPGs had some of the trappings of regular CRPGs. The character could get stronger over time and gain extras which were not merely a result of a short-term "Power-Up." There were specific items that could be acquired which boosted fighting or defense on a permanent basis. Primitive stores were introduced with the concept that a player could buy something to aid him on his journey.}}</ref> It was released on April 14, 1987, in [[Japan]] and later that year in the [[United States]] for the NES. A [[Europe]]an release came in 1990.

The player sends the title character through a number of fantastic settings with the ultimate goal of defeating the evil King Ligar in order to restore peace to the realm of Argool<ref name="story">{{cite book | year=1987 | editor=Tecmo | title=Rygar Instructions | publisher=Tecmo | page=8}}</ref> (Argus in the Japanese version). To accomplish this goal, the Warrior must visit five Indora gods who present him with essential items needed for completion of the game. Each of the Indora gods is located in a different realm, and is almost always guarded by a [[Boss (video game)|boss]]. The player can choose the order in which some stages are played, but since certain items are required to reach new areas, choices are somewhat limited. After playing through the five major realms of the game, he must journey to King Ligar's flying castle for the final confrontation.

The main character, his weapon, and many of the enemies remain the same, but the gameplay  is quite different. While the arcade version is more of a standard side-scrolling action title, the NES's ''Rygar'' is an [[Open world|open-ended]] action-adventure game like ''[[Metroid]]'' (see [[Metroidvania]]), which was also released at the time. At the beginning of the game, Rygar has access to some of the worlds, but as the game progresses, new areas open up as the result of finding items such as the grappling hook, [[crossbow]], and wind pulley, which lets him cross previously impassable obstacles. The NES version of ''Rygar'' was also more of an [[action role-playing game]] with a nonlinear open world map in Garloz.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/rygar-is-a-non-linear-8-bit-masterpiece-1843535240 |title=Rygar Is A Non-Linear 8-Bit Masterpiece. |publisher=Kotaku |author=Peter Tieryas |date=20 May 2020}}</ref> It was particularly notable for its [[Experience point#Perks|permanent power-up]] mechanic, which at the time blurred the line between the [[power-up]]s used in action-adventures and the [[experience point]]s used in [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]].<ref name="cgw_76"/>

This version of ''Rygar'' did not allow for game saves as it lacked a [[Password (video games)|password feature]] and the cartridge did not contain a battery. It did however have unlimited continues.

The NES version replaced some of the soundtracks from its Famicom counterpart but is otherwise graphically identical, save for the title screen and language. The music for both the NES or Famicom versions was composed by Michiharu Hasuya who would later reuse one of ''Rygar''<nowiki />'s tracks  on the title screen of ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (video game)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.

===Bug in the PAL Version===
The [[PAL]] version of the NES game contains a computer error which inadvertently increased (substantially) the difficulty in the final portions of the game, particularly in beating the final boss. The PAL version limited the player's tone and last stats to 1023 points instead of 4095, which meant that there was less maximum life and noticeably less damage to enemies.

''Rygar'' received positive reviews. Allgame editor Michael W. Dean said of the NES version that "(the) game features excellent control and pacing, the freedom of nonlinear level design, good graphics, a fabulous soundtrack, and one of the coolest weapons that any videogame hero has ever wielded".<ref name="allgamereview">{{cite web |url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11932&tab=review |title = Rygar - Review| author = Dean, Michael W. |publisher = [[AllGame]] |access-date =August 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211181209/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11932&tab=review |archive-date=December 11, 2014}}</ref> [[Peter Tieryas]] commended the game for its expansive world and non-linear gameplay relative to the standard for video games at the time of its release. In contrast, he lamented the lack of passwords or game saves available, though the game did feature unlimited continues.<ref name=peter/>

===Lynx===
''[[STart]]'' said of the Lynx version that the "simple game" was only recommended to "jump-and-shoot arcade enthusiasts".<ref name="startv5n6">{{Cite magazine |last=Walnum |first=Clayton |date=February–March 1991 |title=Four More for the Lynx Collection |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv5n6/for_the_fun_of_it.html |magazine=STart}}</ref> CVG Magazine reviewed the Lynx version in their March 1991 issue calling the game "dull" and only giving 46 out of 100.<ref name=cgv-lynx>{{cite magazine |title=Bytesize Atari Lynx |publisher=CVG Magazine |issue=112 |date=March 1991 |page=71 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-112/ |access-date=28 March 2018 }}</ref> Julian Boardman of Raze Magazine reviewed the game in their April 1991 issue and liked "some superb backgrounds" the "wide variety of gruesome monsters" with "enough depth for most gamesters". He also noted the game lacked a certain amount of challenge, giving a final score of 81%.<ref name=raze-review>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/raze-magazine-06/Raze_06_Apr_1991#page/n45 |via=archive.org |title=Rygar |publisher=Raze Magazine |author=Julian Boardman|issue=6 |page=46 |date=April 1991 |access-date=17 August 2018}}</ref>

Robert A. Jung review was published to IGN, in his final verdict he wrote; "Rygar for the Lynx is a "typical" game, neither extremely outstanding nor truly disappointing. While fans of the arcade game will find slight differences, it's close enough to be familiar (especially since the only other adaptation was a vastly different game for the Nintendo). Though there are only 23 levels, the lack of a level skip and game continues means this is an average-difficulty endurance contest which will take some time to finish." Giving a final score of 7 out of 10.<ref name=ign-lynx>{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/07/07/rygar |title=An above average arcade conversion for Atari Lynx. |publisher=IGN Entertainment |author=Robert A.

==Legacy==
{{Main|Rygar: The Legendary Adventure}}
In 2002, a remake titled ''Rygar: The Legendary Adventure'' was released by [[Tecmo]] for [[PlayStation 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/05/hands-on-rygar-the-legendary-adventure|title=Hands-on Rygar: The Legendary Adventure|last=Perry|first=Douglass C.|work=IGN|date=September 5, 2002|access-date=April 18, 2018}}</ref> It features a transition to 3-D graphics and portions of the environment are destructible. It was released to generally positive reviews. On May 11, 2007, a [[Wii]] port was announced at Tecmo's "Nite Out 07" event,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/787/787604p1.html|title=Live from Tecmo's Nite Out 07|date=11 May 2007}}</ref> eventually released on January 28, 2009 in North America.
