'''''Microsoft Flight Simulator''''' is a 1986 video game developed by [[Sublogic]] and published by [[Microsoft]] for the [[Macintosh]].

==Development==
In 1984 [[Amiga Corporation]] asked [[Bruce Artwick]] to port ''Flight Simulator'' for its forthcoming computer, but Commodore's purchase of Amiga temporarily ended the relationship. Sublogic instead finished a Macintosh version, released by Microsoft, then resumed work on the Amiga and [[Atari ST]] versions.<ref name="hockman198704">{{cite magazine | title=Bruce Artwick's Flight Simulator / You've Come A Long Way, Baby! / The History of an Epic Program | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=36 | date=April 1987 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1987&pub=2&id=36 | accessdate=23 April 2016 | last=Hockman | first=Daniel | pages=32â€“34}}</ref>

Notable features included a windowing system allowing multiple simultaneous 3D views - including exterior views of the aircraft itself.

==Reception==
Frank Boosman reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated, "As a game, FS is exciting. Flying beneath the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] was a big thrill, and really had me sweating. FS wins as a simulation as well; the flight characteristics of the [[Cessna 172|Cessna]] and [[Learjet 25|Lear Jet]] seem realistic, and the [[Flight instruments|instrumentation]] is complete."<ref name="CGW30">{{cite magazine |last=Boosman |first=Frank |title=Macintosh Window |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=August 1986 |volume=1 |issue=30 |pages=37}}</ref>
