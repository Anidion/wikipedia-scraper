'''''Leather Goddesses of Phobos''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] video game written by [[Steve Meretzky]] and published by [[Infocom]] in 1986. It was released for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Amstrad PCW]], [[Apple II]], [[Mac (computer)|Mac]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[TI-99/4A]], and [[MS-DOS]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/leather-goddesses-of-phobos |title=Leather Goddesses of Phobos |website=MobyGames |access-date=July 12, 2021}}</ref> The game was Infocom's first "sex farce", including selectable gender and "naughtiness"—the latter ranging from "tame" to "lewd". It was one of five top-selling Infocom titles to be re-released in Solid Gold versions. It was Infocom's twenty-first game.

==Gameplay==
To start the game a gender must be chosen and the player will get a sidekick character. If the player's character is male, he will meet a burly but dim-witted man named Trent; if the player's character is female, she will find an attractive but somewhat ditzy woman named Tiffany. There are differences in game-play between the two sexes.

''Leather Goddesses of Phobos'' bore a difficulty rating of "Standard". The game has 75 locations, including the maze known as the catacombs, the planets Mars and Venus (which must be explored extensively), outer space, and the city of Cleveland, which is a single location with one building and two exits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resonant.org/games/infocom/Infocom_Homepage/lgop.html|title=Leather Goddesses of Phobos|work=Resonant.org|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-date=2018-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506042551/https://www.resonant.org/games/infocom/Infocom_Homepage/lgop.html|date=1996}}</ref>

==Plot==
The game begins in [[Upper Sandusky, Ohio]], in 1936 and is presented in the manner of a [[science fiction]] [[Serial (film)|serial]] of that time. In the story, the Leather Goddesses of [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] are just finalizing their plans for the invasion of Earth. The player's character had been abducted by the Leather Goddesses for the final testing of the plan which would enslave all of humanity. Unless this nefarious plan is stopped, the Earth is turned into a twisted sexual pleasure dome.

==Development==
A few months after Infocom moved into its [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] offices, Meretzky jokingly wrote the words "Leather Goddesses of Phobos" on a large chalkboard that listed all of the Infocom games that were in release at that point. Meretzky described the title as "something that would be a little embarrassing, but not awful." [[Joel Berez]] spotted the added line before anyone else arrived and erased it quickly, but the name stuck and was jokingly brought up whenever a non-existent game title needed to be worked into a sentence. Eventually, in 1985, Meretzky came around to the idea of actually creating a game under this title, and started its development as a 1930s [[science fiction]] pulp story &ndash; the idea was instantly accepted by [[Marc Blank]] and the other Infocom staff. Upper management was more difficult to convince, and then-CEO Al Vezza (who was more interested in the business side of the company) was not enthused with the idea. However, when Infocom was acquired by [[Activision]] in 1986 due to the bankrupted business products effort, Activision president [[Jim Levy]] was much more excited: when told that "Leather Goddesses of Phobos" was not its definitive title, he allegedly responded with "I wouldn't call it anything else!"<ref>{{cite book|title=Game Design Theory & Practice|version=Second Edition|publisher=Worldware Publishing, Inc.|last=Rouse III|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Rouse III|year=2005|isbn=1-55622-912-7|page=179}}</ref>

Infocom marketing director Mike Dornbrook referred to ''Leather Goddesses of Phobos'' as "''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide]]'' with sex."<ref name=statusline /> In The Status Line (formerly The New Zork Times), Infocom's official newsletter, [[Steve Meretzky]] stated that the title ''Leather Goddesses of Phobos'' was conceived more than four years before the game was released.<ref name=statusline /> He also cites "pulpy [[space opera]]" as an inspiration for ''Leather Goddesses'', and expresses that a lack of controversial response to ''[[A Mind Forever Voyaging]]'' was another reason for ''Leather Goddess''' conception, stating that "I was hoping that [''A Mind Forever Voyaging''] would stir up a lot of controversy. It didnt ... So I decided to write something with a little bit of sex in it, because ''nothing'' generates controversy like sex. I'm hoping to get the game banned from Seven-Eleven stores."<ref name=statusline /> Meretzky states that the "naughtiness" levels were based on the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|film rating system]], with tame, suggestive, and lewd corresponding to G, PG, and R respectively.<ref name=statusline>{{cite journal|title = Leather Goddesses of Phobos|date = September 1986|url = https://archive.org/details/Status_Line_The_Vol._V_No._3_1986-09_Infocom_US/page/n1|journal = The Status Line|publisher = Infocom| volume = 5|pages = 1–3}}</ref>

==Release==

The game was not [[copy protection|copy protected]], but included puzzles that relied on the accompanying documentation and physical items in the package:

#A small [[scratch and sniff]] card which bore seven numbered areas (at certain points in the game, the player would be instructed to scratch a certain number and then whiff the resulting odor such as pizza and chocolate).
#''The Adventures of Lane Mastodon'', a [[Stereoscopy|3-D]] [[comic book]] containing vital hints to the game.
#3D glasses for the comic book.
#A double-sided map of the catacombs.

This take on copy protection earned ''Leather Goddesses'' a [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]] for ''Best Software Packaging'' in 1987.

==Reception==
''Leather Goddesses of Phobos'' was Infocom's best-selling game in 1986 with 53,543 copies sold, more than 50% greater than that of ''[[Trinity (video game)|Trinity]]'', which also debuted that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/09/great_scott_infocoms_alltime_s.php |title=Great Scott: Infocom's All-Time Sales Numbers Revealed |date=2008-09-20 |work=GameSetWatch |publisher=Think Services |access-date=2008-09-23 |first=Simon |last=Carless |author-link=Simon Carless |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924074642/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/09/great_scott_infocoms_alltime_s.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-09-24 }}</ref> The company sold a total of about 130,000 copies, three times as many as any other game after [[Activision]] bought them. The game was Infocom's last to sell more than 100,000 copies, and its sixth best-selling game overall.<ref name="maher20150305">{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2015/03/leather-goddesses-of-phobos-or-sex-comes-to-the-micros-again/ | title=Leather Goddesses of Phobos (or, Sex Comes to the Micros — Again) | publisher=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2015-03-05 | access-date=2015-03-05| author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref>

''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''Leather Goddesses of Phobos'', calling it "an excellent [example] of text-only interactive fiction." ''Macworld'' expresses that ''Leather Goddesses'' has "respect for female players ... ''Leather Goddesses'' is neither sexist nor truly offensive. Its humor punctures the pretensions of the fantasy adventure genre." ''Macworld'' praises the gameplay, stating that it has "inventive plots and puzzles" and "consistency of mood and attitude". ''Macworld'' criticizes the inability to scroll back to previously seen text.<ref>{{cite magazine|last = McCandless|first = Keith|title = Gender-Specific Leather and Lace: Leather Goddesses of Phobos Release 59 Review|date = August 1987|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_8708_August_1987/page/n163|magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|pages = 159–160}}</ref>

''[[Info (magazine)|.Info]]'' in 1987 gave the Commodore 64 version four stars out of five, describing it as "fun to play, though Infocom has produced more challenging standard-level text adventures ... a lot of giggles in this one". The magazine assured readers they would not be offended by the game, as even its lewdest "naughtiness" level is relatively tame.<ref name="info198701">{{Cite magazine |last=Dunnington |first=Benn |last2=Brown |first2=Mark R. |last3=Malcolm |first3=Tom |date=January–February 1987 |title=64/128 Gallery |url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n13/mode/2up |magazine=Info |pages=21}}</ref> In 1988, [[Tom Clancy]] named ''Leather Goddesses of Phobos'' one of his favorite computer games, stating "I'd like to meet whoever wrote that.

==Legacy==
A sequel to ''Leather Goddesses of Phobos'', subtitled ''[[Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2: Gas Pump Girls Meet the Pulsating Inconvenience from Planet X!|Gas Pump Girls Meet the Pulsating Inconvenience from Planet X!]]'', was published by [[Activision]] in 1992.

In the 2015 film ''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]'' starring [[Matt Damon]], ''Leather Goddesses of Phobos'' was referenced as being loaded on fellow astronaut Beth Johanssen's laptop alongside ''[[Zork II]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eisenberg |first1=Eric |title=The Martian: 5 Cool Little References The Movie Works In |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Martian-5-Cool-Little-References-Movie-Works-86397.html |access-date=23 February 2022 |work=Cinemablend |date=5 October 2015 |language=en}}</ref>
