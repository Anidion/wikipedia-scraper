==Gameplay==

''Pirates of the Barbary Coast'' interface is menu-driven, controlled with a pointer. The general map shows seven ports in North Africa and some islands in the Atlantic. Navigation to the selected destination is automatic and takes a number of days of game time. The condition of the ship and crew must be taken into account, especially care must be taken not to run out of food.

In each port it is possible to buy and sell goods (wool, silk, rum, tobacco, etc.) at prices that vary with location and time. The actual price can be haggled, but if the player pushes too hard, the local merchant may get impatient and will refuse to deal with the player. In addition, it is always possible to commission repairs, stock up on ammunition and food, and buy information.

While sailing from one port to another, the player's ship may be attacked by pirates, leading to a real-time action sequence. The enemy ship slowly passes in front of the player's 15 cannons, shown one at a time from behind. In order to fire it is first necessary to select the elements in the right order with the pointer, to perform the realistic loading operations: inserting and pressing powder, inserting ball, brushing barrel. To fire, the player must select a cannon and adjust the elevation. If the opponent is defeated, there is a choice between seizing its gold or the captain's log, which contains information.

==Reception==
