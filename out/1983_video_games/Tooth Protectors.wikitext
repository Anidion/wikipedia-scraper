'''''Tooth Protectors''''' is a rare video game for the [[Atari 2600]] video game console. It was released exclusively via [[mail order]] in 1983 by American pharmaceutical and consumer goods manufacturer [[Johnson & Johnson]].

== Background ==
Released in 1983, ''Tooth Protectors'' is one of the earliest "[[advergames]]" or "promogames" – games with overt tie-ins to retail products – and one of several released that year for the Atari 2600 platform (others included [[M Network]]'s ''[[Kool-Aid Man (video game)|Kool-Aid Man]]'' and [[Purina Mills|Purina]]'s ''[[Chase the Chuck Wagon]]''.)<ref name="Bogost" /><ref name="ChangingTheGame" /><ref name="Billboard" /> Commissioned by Johnson & Johnson and developed by DSD/Camelot, it was the only game released for the Atari 2600 by either company.<ref name="AtariAgeDSD" />

The game was never given a traditional retail release, but was instead available exclusively to Johnson & Johnson customers who mailed in [[proof of purchase]] stamps to the company.<ref name="RacingTheBeam" /> Today it is considered rare and valuable;<ref name="Billboard" /> the game received a rating of 9 ("Extremely Rare") from the [[Atari Age]] rarity guide.<ref name="AtariAgeDSD" />

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Tooth Protectors gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|250px|Gameplay screenshot]]
The gameplay is similar to that of [[Activision]]'s ''[[Kaboom! (video game)|Kaboom!]]'', in which the player must prevent objects dropping from the top of the screen from reaching the bottom by positioning their character directly under the falling objects. In ''Tooth Protectors'', the objects are small "snack" squares dropped by the "Snack Attacker", a menacing-looking face that moves horizontally along the top of the screen. The player's character is a small smiling face carrying a strand of [[dental floss]] above its head. The player must prevent the snack squares from reaching the row of white teeth along the bottom of the screen; repeated hits by the snacks cause the teeth to blink and disappear from [[tooth decay]].<ref name="ChangingTheGame" /><ref name="manual" />

Occasionally the Snack Attacker will dive from the top of the screen in an attempt to grab the player; the player loses a turn if the Snack Attacker succeeds. If teeth begin to decay, the player can press the joystick's fire button to call in the "Tooth Protectors": an orange [[toothbrush]], green box of dental floss and purple [[dental rinse]] bottle move across the teeth, brushing, flossing and rinsing them.<ref name="ChangingTheGame" /><ref name="Weiss" />

The instruction manual included with the game ends by presenting "The ''Real'' Tooth Protectors": advertisements for Johnson & Johnson-branded toothbrushes, dental floss and dental rinse.<ref name="manual" />
