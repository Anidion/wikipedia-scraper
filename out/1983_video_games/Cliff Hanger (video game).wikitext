'''''Cliff Hanger''''' is a [[laserdisc video game]] that was released by [[Stern (game company)|Stern Electronics]] in 1983. It is an [[interactive movie]], using animation from two ''[[Lupin III]]'' films, and requires the player to respond to [[quick time event]]s to progress the storyline. Most of the game's footage is from ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' (1979), with additional footage from ''[[The Mystery of Mamo]]'' (1978).

== Plot ==
The game's plot is based loosely on ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' and follows the eponymous [[Arsène Lupin III|Cliff Hanger]] as he attempts to rescue Clarissa from the evil Count Draco (in some materials called "Dreyco"<ref>[http://www.dragons-lair-project.com/games/materials/flyers/large/ch_02.jpg Dragons-lair-project.com]</ref> and in the instruction manual "Dragoe"), who wants to marry her. Cliff is aided in his quest by [[Daisuke Jigen|Jeff]] (Dan Dunn) and [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII|Samurai]].

== Development ==
The game was originally edited at Associated Audio Visual, Inc., in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. Jack Bornoff, was the editor, Paul Rubenstein, was editorial supervisor.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} The segments from ''The Mystery of Mamo'' use the original [[Toho]] / [[Frontier Enterprises]] English dub, while the segments from ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' use an English dub created for the game.

''Cliff Hanger'' uses a feedback loop to read frame details from the game laserdisc. This prevents the laserdisc and gameplay from ever going out of sync (a common occurrence in other laserdisc games as the disc players aged).{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The original version of ''Cliff Hanger'' shows footage from ''The Mystery of Mamo'' of Cliff being hanged if the player fails a quick time event. According to the instruction manual, a setting on the game cabinet's logic board would allow the individual owners/operators the option of not playing the sequence if they so chose.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

== Legacy ==
The game was considered for inclusion on the American [[Blu-ray]] release of ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' by [[Discotek Media]], but when it became apparent that the original contracts for the game were lost, it was left off the release.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bertschy|first=Zac|title=ANNCastle of Cagliostro|website=[[Anime News Network]]|date=26 June 2015|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anncast/2015-06-26/.89753|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>

The television show ''[[Starcade]]'' featured a special episode where rather than playing the usual three games, the contestants played three rounds of ''Cliff Hanger''. The winner of the show, Mark Walsh, won a ''Cliff Hanger'' cabinet.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Starcade |series-link=Starcade|series=Starcade|station=[[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|WTBS]] |date= |number=103}}</ref>

In the film ''[[The Goonies]]'' (1985), Chunk is playing ''Cliff Hanger'' when he sees the Fratelli Brothers driving past while being chased by the police.<ref>[http://www.thegoonies.org/BB/viewtopic.php?p=14083 Thegoonies.org] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120918124448/http://www.thegoonies.org/BB/viewtopic.php?p=14083 |date=2012-09-18}}</ref>

''Cliff Hanger'' helped expose many Americans in the 1980s to ''[[Lupin III]]'', [[Hayao Miyazaki]], and Japanese [[anime]] in general, as it was released in the United States before any ''Lupin III'' or Miyazaki anime productions had officially been released theatrically or on [[home video]].<ref name="om">{{cite web | url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx | title=The Castle of Cagliostro Hayao Miyazaki's First (And Most Enjoyable) Movie | publisher=Otaku USA Magazine | date=9 March 2012 | access-date=27 August 2013 | author=Surat, Daryl | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018154933/http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx | archive-date=18 October 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all}}</ref>
