'''''Guzzler''''' is a 1983 maze video game developed and published by [[Tehkan]]. It was licensed to [[Centuri]] for North American distribution. It was released as an arcade conversion kit, including a new marquee and control panel,{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} then ported to the [[SG-1000]] console. In ''Guzzler'', the player controls a creature who can drink (or [[wikt:guzzle|guzzle]]) water from puddles, then extinguish [[fire]]s and [[monster]]s spawned from those fires.

== Gameplay ==
Each level is a [[maze]] of varying openness. That must be extinguished to complete the level, also spawn fire-themed monsters which pursue the player. The main character can attack with three blasts of [[liquid]] before becoming empty.  With each blast of liquid, the character moves faster and gets closer to being an empty outline with [[pink]] [[shoe]]s. When empty the character is a shell of a sprite, but moves faster. Liquid is replenished by drinking from puddles.  Occasionally, an alcoholic beverage appears in the center of the screen. Picking it up causes the character to refill and turn red and the fires temporarily freeze.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Reception==
William Michael Brown wrote in the ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' 1983 coin-op preview:
{{blockquote|text=Of all the brand new [conversion] kit titles we saw, probably the best is Ceniuri's ''Guzzler''â€”a comical maze game starring a little guy who is not much more than a fat, mobile water tank. Up against a fast mob of angry demons, flashes and fireballs, his only defense is to drench them with some of his limited supply of water. The game's graphics and sounds are outstanding, and there's even a special feature that lets you win a free game whether you scored high or not.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=William Michael |title=Hot Fun in the Summertime |journal=Electronic Fun with Computers & Games |date=July 1983 |volume=1 |issue=9 |pages=26, 27 |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_09_1983-07_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/page/n25/mode/2up?q=guzzler}}</ref>}}
