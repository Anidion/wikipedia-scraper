==Reception==
Contemporary reviews of ''Z-Tack'' were mixed. In 1983, ''TV Gamer'' magazine described it as "probably the second-best video game to come from this new company, BOMB, the best being ''[[Assault (1983 video game)|Assault]]''" and "Not a world-beating game but well worth having a look".<ref name="TV Gamer">{{cite journal |title=Z-Tack: New! |journal=TV Gamer |date=Autumn 1983 |page=40 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/magazines/tv_gamer/tv_gamer_autumn83.pdf |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> ''Videogaming Illustrated'' gave it good marks for gameplay (B, B+) but marked it down for lack-lustre graphics (C-, D).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Z-Tack |journal=Videogaming Illustrated |date=September 1983 |pages=37–38 |url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_and_Computer_Gaming_Illustrated_1983-09_Ion_International_US/page/n37 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> German magazine ''TeleMatch'' gave it 3/6 overall, describing it as a "relatively inexpensive shooting game" but criticising its lack of originality.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Z-Tack Review |journal=TeleMatch |date=August–September 1983 |pages=30–31 |url=https://archive.org/details/TeleMatch.N05.1983.08-KCz.pdf/page/n31 |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> The Australian magazine ''Score'' reviewed the game positively in their 1983 review, praising the "colourful" graphics and sound, though also noting that they were "simplistic".<ref name="Score">{{cite news |title=Against The Wall |url=https://archive.org/details/Score_201506/page/n35/mode/2up?q=%22Wall-Defender%22 |access-date=25 February 2021 |work=Score |issue=1 |date=1983 |page=34}}</ref>
