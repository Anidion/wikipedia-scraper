{{nihongo|'''''Antarctic Adventure'''''|けっきょく南極大冒険|Kekkyoku Nankyoku Daibōken|''lit. "After all Antarctic Great Adventure"''}} is a [[video game]] developed by [[Konami]] in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]] for the [[MSX]], and later for [[video game console]]s, such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] and [[ColecoVision]]. The player takes the role of an Antarctic [[penguin]], racing to various [[research station]]s owned by different countries in [[Antarctica]] (excluding the [[USSR]]).

The gameplay is similar to [[Sega]]'s ''[[Turbo (video game)|Turbo]]'', but plays at a much slower pace, and features [[platform game]] elements. The penguin, later named [[Parodius|Penta]], must reach the next station before time runs out while avoiding [[sea lion]]s and breaks in the ice. Throughout the levels, fish jump out of ice holes and can be caught for bonus points. The game, like many early video games, has no ending &ndash; when the player reaches the last station, the game starts from the first level again, but with increased difficulty.

==Legacy==
''Antarctic Adventure'' was followed by a sequel for the [[MSX]] computer in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], entitled ''[[Penguin Adventure]]''. In addition, the penguin character Penta, and his son Pentarou<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/34738/New-International-Track-and-Field | title =New International Track and Field <nowiki>|</nowiki> Press Release | author = | date = | work =[[MCV (magazine)|MCV]] | publisher = | accessdate = October 5, 2011}}</ref> became a [[mascot]] for Konami through the 1980s. They have made appearances in over 10 games. Of particular note are his appearances in the [[Parodius|''Parodius'' series]] of [[shoot 'em up]] games.

Penta, or his son Pentarou, had appeared in [[Medal game|Medal Games]] like ''[[Tsurikko Penta]]'', ''Balloon Penta'' and ''Imo Hori Penta''. Following in 2002 (not released for mobile in 2001), three mobile games {{Nihongo|'''''Kekkyo ku Nankyoku choi bōken'''''|けっきょく南極ちょい冒険}},<ref>http://www.itmedia.co.jp/games/gsnews/0205/08/news03.html</ref> were released on May 6, 2003, another titled {{nihongo|'''''Kekkyoku Nankyoku Daibōken Taisen-ban'''''|けっきょく南極大冒険対戦版}}, as part of ''Konami Taisen Colosseum'',<ref>[http://k-tai.impress.co.jp/cda/article/news_toppage/13860.html コナミ、iアプリ対応の通信型対戦ゲーム配信サイトオープン]</ref> and the fishing game as ''[[Penta no Tsuri Bōken|Penta no Tsuri Boken]]'', released for i-Revo.

A screenshot from this game can briefly be seen in the introduction of ''[[Gradius ReBirth]]'', released in 2008 for the [[Virtual Console Wii|Wii Virtual Console]] and in 2014 for the [[Wii u virtual console|Wii U Virtual Console]]. An MSX Version was re-released for the Windows Store as part of EGG Project on November 25, 2014 in Japan.

In 1990, Konami released only in Japan a [[handheld electronic game]] of ''Antarctic Adventure'', although it is usually listed as ''South Pole'' (a more literal translation of the Japanese title).<ref>[http://www.handheldempire.com/game.jsp?game=1037 ''South Pole'' at Handheld Empire]</ref><ref>[http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Konami/SouthPole.htm ''South Pole'' at Handheld Museum]</ref>

In 2014, ''Antarctic Adventure'' was released on a special version of the [[ColecoVision#Legacy|ColecoVision Flashback]] by AtGames.<ref>[http://www.atgames.us/ ''AtGames'']</ref> available only through [[Dollar General]]<ref>[http://www.dollargeneral.com/product/index.jsp?productId=43753776 ''Dollar General''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109083527/http://www.dollargeneral.com/product/index.jsp?productId=43753776 |date=2014-11-09}}</ref> stores.

In other games, Pentarou appears as a fisherman.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}
