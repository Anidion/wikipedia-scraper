'''''Mined-Out''''' is a [[List of maze video games|maze]] video game created by Ian Andrew originally for the [[ZX Spectrum]] home computer in 1983. The objective is to carefully navigate a series of grid-shaped [[land mine|minefields]] by moving from the bottom to the top of the screen. The number of invisible mines in spaces adjacent to the player's current position is shown but not their precise location, requiring deduction to advance past them and avoid getting blown up. Additional challenges are introduced in later stages.

Andrew was an early adopter of the [[ZX81|Sinclair ZX81]] and Spectrum. He learned to program in [[Sinclair BASIC|BASIC]] in his spare time and used the Spectrum's colour limitations in designing ''Mined-Out'' as his first commercial product. He sent a copy to [[Quicksilva]] after the company advertised a request for new titles to publish. The game was promptly [[porting|ported]] to other computers including the [[Dragon 32]], [[Camputers Lynx]], [[Oric (computer)|Oric]], [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]].

''Mined-Out'' was a financial success, allowing Andrew to establish his own development studio, [[Incentive Software]]. The game was also critically well-received by British computer publications. The simple yet novel use of [[logic puzzle|logic]] in its gameplay was generally praised while opinions on its presentation varied slightly between versions. Although ''Mined-Out'' was not the first ''[[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]''-style game, it preceded the popular ''[[Microsoft Minesweeper]]'' by several years and likely influenced it.

==Gameplay==

Later stages add more challenges. Female worms called "[[damsel in distress|Damsels]]" can be rescued for bonus points starting on the second level. The third level introduces a "Mine Spreader" that relocates mines on a horizontal portion of the map and make them visible. While the game has no time limit, a mobile mine called "The Bug" begins stalking the player through their path starting on the fourth level, pressuring them to advance towards the goal.<ref name="PCN"/><ref name="ZXComputing"/><ref name="AcornUser"/> Lastly, the player's revealed path will disappear behind them beginning on the sixth level.<ref name="RetroGamer124"/> Any previously completed maze can be attempted again.<ref name="ZXComputing"/>

==Development and release==
''Mined-Out'' was written and [[video game programmer|programmed]] by Ian Andrew. He ran a postage stamp and postcard business in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and was among the first individuals to purchase a [[ZX81|Sinclair ZX81]] after seeing it advertised in the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. He taught himself to program in [[Sinclair BASIC|BASIC]] with the machine and then bought a [[ZX Spectrum]] when it launched in 1982, leisurely creating games for his own amusement. ''Mined-Out'' would be his first commercial product.<ref name="CrashInterview">{{cite magazine | author=[[Roger Kean|Kean, Roger]] | date=May 1985 | title=Mined-Out and Confuzed | url=https://archive.org/details/Crash_No._16_1985-05_Newsfield_GB/page/n109/mode/1up | magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] | publisher=[[Newsfield]] | issue=16 | page=110 | issn=0954-8661}}</ref><ref name="ArmstradComputerUser">{{cite magazine | author=Rockman, Simon | date=December 1988 | title=Feature: Postcards to Egypt | url=https://archive.org/details/AmstradComputerUser49-1288/page/n14/mode/1up | magazine=[[Amstrad Computer User]] | publisher=Avralite Ltd. | issue=49 | page=15 | issn=0952-3049}}</ref><ref name="RetroGamer87">{{cite magazine | author=Mason, Graeme | date=April 2011 | title=From the Archives: Incentive Software | url=https://archive.org/details/retro-gamer-raspberry-pi-buenos-aires/Retro%20Gamer%20087/page/52/mode/1up | magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] | publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] | issue=87 | page=52 | issn=1742-3155}}</ref>

It took Andrew three months to program<ref name="RetroGamer124"/> and six months to complete all work on ''Mined-Out''.<ref name="Eurogamer">{{cite web | author=Griliopoulos, Dan | date=July 21, 2014 | title=Every step you take: The story of ''Minesweeper'' | url=https://www.eurogamer.net/every-step-you-take-the-story-of-minesweeper | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240404123136/https://www.eurogamer.net/every-step-you-take-the-story-of-minesweeper | archive-date=April 4, 2024 | website=[[Eurogamer]] | publisher=[[Gamer Network]] | accessdate=April 28, 2024}}</ref> He stated that the game's concept was a result of the Spectum's colour limitations, as each "character square" (consisting of eight by eight [[pixel]]s) could have only two colours, making the system ideal for games using grids.<ref name="Eurogamer"/> Simply moving through such squares did not qualify as a game to Andrew, so he made some of them invisible and gave the player clues to avoid them, leading to its mine detection gameplay.<ref name="RetroGamer124"/> ''Mined-Out'' was originally designed as a single level that became faster the longer it was played. Andrew's mother [[playtest]]ed and quickly mastered this format, so he broke the game up into levels of increasing difficulty to deliberately set it apart from many of its contemporaries.<ref name="CrashInterview"/> Since the game would be available to a wide audience, more features were added to subsequent stages to "keep it interesting for as long as possible."<ref name="RetroGamer124"/>

==Reception==
''Mined-Out'' was well-received by British computer publications upon its release. Critics largely agreed that the mine-detection gameplay offered a simple yet novel addition to the maze genre. Mike Gerrard of ''[[Personal Computer News]]'', Chris Adam-Smith of ''ZX Computing'', and reviewers for ''Games Computing'' and ''Home Computing Weekly'' all positively noted this feature as addictive in its various releases.<ref name="PCN"/><ref name="ZXComputing"/><ref name="GamesComputing">{{cite magazine | author=''Games Computing'' staff | date=November 1984 | title=Software Reviews: ''Mined-Out'' | url=https://archive.org/details/Games_Computing_1984-11_Argus_Specialist_Publications_GB/page/n33/mode/1up | magazine=Games Computing | publisher=[[Argus Press#Argus Specialist Publications|Argus Specialist Publications]] | page=34}}</ref><ref name="HCWMicro">{{cite magazine | author=I.W. | date=November 22, 1983 | title=Software Reviews: ''Mined-Out'' | url=https://archive.org/details/home-computing-weekly-038/page/n30/mode/1up | magazine=Home Computing Weekly | publisher=[[Argus Press#Argus Specialist Publications|Argus Specialist Publications]] | issue=38 | page=31 | issn=02644991}}</ref> Assessing the [[ZX Spectrum]] version, Gerrard summarized, "Can you praise any game higher than by saying itâ€™s one of those where you decide youâ€™ll have just one more go, then find yourself still playing half an hour later?"<ref name="PCN"/> ''[[Acorn User]]'' reviewer Vincent Fojut called the [[BBC Micro]] version "a refreshing change from the usual â€˜blast 'em out of the skyâ€™ derivatives."<ref name="AcornUser"/> ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' recommended the game in its 1984 catalog of Spectrum reviews by stating "it hasn't dated a bit" and it that it was "still worth the money if you haven't tried it."<ref>{{cite magazine | author=''Crash'' staff | date=March 1984 | title=Living Guide to Spectrum Software | url=https://archive.org/details/Crash_No._02_1984-03_Newsfield_GB/page/n58/mode/1up | magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] | publisher=[[Newsfield]] | issue=2 | page=59 | issn=0954-8661}}</ref> Stuart Campbell of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' listed the game as the 97th best Spectrum game of all time in 1991, citing its core logic gameplay as "one of the greatest mind-teasers ever devised."<ref>{{cite magazine | author=Campbell, Stuart | date=October 1991 | title=The Ys Top 100 Speccy Games Of All Time (Ever!) | url=https://archive.org/details/Your_Sinclair_070/page/n30/mode/1up | magazine=[[Your Sinclair]] | publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] | issue=70 | page=31 | issn=0269-6983}}</ref> Vic Fielder of ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' oppositely found the game to lack [[replay value]].<ref>{{cite magazine | author=Fielder, Vic | date=September 6, 1984 | title=Reviews: Visible mine | url=https://archive.org/details/NH2021_Popular_Computing_Weekly_Issue840906.pdf/page/19/mode/1up | magazine=[[Popular Computing Weekly]] | publisher=[[Sunshine Publications]] | volume=3 | issue=36 | page=19 | issn=0265-0509}}</ref>

Opinions on the game's presentation were somewhat mixed. ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', which listed the [[Dragon 32/64|Dragon 32]] version among their Hall of Fame Games in early 1984,<ref>{{cite magazine | author=''CVG'' staff | date=February 1984 | title=Our Hall of Fame Games | url=https://archive.org/details/ComputerAndVideoGamesIssue028Feb84/page/n74/mode/1up | magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] | publisher=[[Future plc]] | issue=28 | page=26 | issn=0261-3697}}</ref> called it "slickly presented" and that the music and sound effects would suitably accompany the player's actions.<ref>{{cite magazine | author=''CVG'' staff | date=July 1983 | title=Save Bill the Worm from Sudden Death: ''Mined-Out'' | url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-021/page/n136/mode/1up | magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] | publisher=[[Future plc]] | issue=21 | page=137 | issn=0261-3697}}</ref> Gerrard judged the graphics as "effective" and the sound effects "as good as you can expect from the Spectrum, if thatâ€™s not an insult."<ref name="PCN"/> ''Games Computing'' concluded that the "graphics are satisfactory and the sound is minimal, but neither stetches the Oric to its considerable limits."<ref name="GamesComputing"/> One contributor for ''Home Computing Weekly'' noted that the "graphics are simple, colourful, and perfectly adequate" for the Spectrum version.<ref name="HCWSpectrum"/> While another writer for the same publication positively noted that "colour and sound are used dramatically" to keep one's interest in the Dragon 32 version, they were disappointed by its low-resolution graphics and a "great disparity between the [[video game packaging|packaging]] and the visual product."<ref name="HCWDragon"/> Fojut complained about the mandatory loading of the demonstration and instructions before each play session.<ref name="AcornUser"/>

==Legacy==
''Mined-Out'' was an early ''[[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]''-style game and preceded the popular 1990 [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] inclusion ''[[Microsoft Minesweeper]]'' by several years. The two share important similarities such as a grid layout and a display showing the number of adjacent mines. ''[[Eurogamer]]'' writer Dan Griliopoulos labeled ''Mined-Out'' as an inspiration for ''Minesweeper'' and even received commentary from ''Mined-Out'' creator Ian Andrew in 2014 that he believes Microsoft copied his game.<ref name="Eurogamer"/> In an interview that same year with Graeme Mason of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', Andrew humorously admitted he would have liked a credit from Microsoft.<ref name="RetroGamer124"/> Griliopoulos was told by Microsoft programmer Curt Johnson that an unnamed [[Mac (computer)|Macintosh]] [[video game clone|clone]] of ''Mined-Out'' was instead used as the base for ''Microsoft Minesweeper''.<ref name="Eurogamer"/>

Will Freeman of ''[[PCGamesN]]'' and ''[[Cracked.com]]'' contributors Adam Wears and Jim Avery pointed to ''Cube'', submitted to ''[[Creative ComputingÂ (magazine)|Creative Computing]]'' in 1973 by Jerimac Ratliff, as the original forebear of the genre.<ref name="PCGamesN">{{cite web | author=Freeman, Will | date=May 6, 2020 | title=Why ''Minesweeper'' is one of the PCâ€™s best forms of escapism | url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/minesweeper/get-free | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240116165432/https://www.pcgamesn.com/minesweeper/get-free | archive-date=January 16, 2024 | website=[[PCGamesN]] | publisher=Network N Media | accessdate=April 29, 2024}}</ref><ref name="Cracked">{{cite web | author1=Wears, Adam | author2=Avery, Jim | date=January 13, 2012 | title=7 Classic Video Games That Are Older Than You Think | url=http://www.cracked.com/article_19619_7-classic-video-games-that-are-older-than-you-think.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230926031855/www.cracked.com/article_19619_7-classic-video-games-that-are-older-than-you-think.html | archive-date=September 26, 2023 | website=[[Cracked.com]] | publisher=Literally Media |accessdate=April 28, 2024}}</ref> Freeman also saw ''Minefield'' from a 1982 issue of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' as another earlier example, but credited ''Mined-Out'' for refining the notion of displaying mine proximities.<ref name="PCGamesN"/> Wears and Avery remarked that despite having less features, Microsoft's game earned fame and ubiquity thanks to being on the popular Windows operating system.<ref name="Cracked"/> Mason also talked with Damien Mason, creator of the ''Authoritative Minesweeper'' website and world rankings, who drew a direct link between ''Relentless Logic'' and Microsoft's game but felt that ''Mined-Out'' was an influence.<ref name="RetroGamer124"/>
