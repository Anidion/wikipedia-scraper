==Reception==

''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'': "A classic ''Phoenix''. Fire rate and left/right movement are the best weâ€™ve seen. Beautiful graphics featuring red Firebirds, blue Bombers, and white Weavers in an intricate dance of death. 100 percent machine code. Very difficult to get to see the mothership, but worth it! Highly recommended."<ref name="Living Guide">{{cite journal |date=February 1984 |title=Living Guide... |journal=[[CRASH (magazine)|Crash]] |issue=1 |pages=56}}</ref>

''[[Sinclair User]]'': "The game could have been reasonably good if more attention had been paid to detail. Perhaps it would be a good idea for Softek to forget about compiler games and produce something in pure machine code. The games may be easy to produce but they are not so much fun to play"<ref>{{cite journal |date=September 1983 |title=Review... |journal=[[Sinclair User]] |issue=18 |pages=34}}</ref>
