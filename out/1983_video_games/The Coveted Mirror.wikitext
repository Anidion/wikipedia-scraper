''The Coveted Mirror'' involves frequent, timed escapes from the jail tower.  Within a limited timeframe, indicated by an hourglass, the player must search the castle, find objects, and talk to people, and return to the cell by the time the jailer makes his rounds. This timed element adds another dimension to the exploration and puzzle solving.<ref>{{cite web

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' called ''The Coveted Mirror'' "a great balance of magic and mystery". The magazine liked the "intelligent" parser with built-in hints and the "remarkably well done yet nonviolent" arcade sequences, and concluded that it "is probably the best graphic adventure of the year".<ref name="pape19840102">{{cite web
