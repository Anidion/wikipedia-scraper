In the game, the player controls the [[Millennium Falcon]] with the aim of destroying the second [[Death Star]]. The game is split into two stages. In the first, the player must shoot enemy [[TIE fighters]] while waiting for an opportunity to pass through an [[energy shield]].<ref name="elovaara" />

In the second stage, the player must shoot at parts of the Death Star until there is a clear path to the reactor. Once the reactor has been destroyed, the player must avoid being hit by fireballs from the resultant explosion.

Once these objectives are completed, the game begins again in a new round with greater difficulty.

==Release==
The [[cover art]] depicts the Millennium Falcon in flight away from the partially constructed Death Star, pursued by four TIE interceptors. It was produced by science fiction artist [[John Berkey]], who designed some of the earliest poster art for the original 1977 film, ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.<ref name="sw-art">{{cite web|title=Star Wars Art â€“ John Berkey Art|url=https://johnberkeyart.com/star-wars-art/|website=johnberkeyart.com|date=7 May 2015 |access-date=19 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619123346/https://johnberkeyart.com/star-wars-art/|archive-date=19 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
