'''''RealSports Tennis''''' is a [[sports video game]] developed and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] for the [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]],<ref name=mania/> and [[Atari 8-bit computers]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-realsports-tennis_4316.html| title = RealSports Tennis for Atari 8-bit| website = Atari Mania}}</ref> in 1983.<ref name=mania/> It is part of the ''[[RealSports]]'' series of games.<ref name="Retro Gamer" />

== Gameplay ==
[[File:RealSports Tennis Screenshot.png|thumb|right|268px|Gameplay screenshot]]
Before the game starts, players have to name their character, a first for an Atari 2600 game,<ref name="Retro Gamer">{{cite journal |last=Jainschigg |first=John |title=The History of RealSports |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=183 |date=August 2018 |pages=44–49 |publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref> and choose between one and two player mode and the two pre-set difficulty levels ("slow" and "fast").

In the game, one player with a blue shirt plays tennis against an [[Artificial intelligence in video games|AI]] enemy portrayed by a [[non-player character]] (NPC) with a red shirt. In the two-player mode, one player competes against another player local. Players can move vertically and horizontally on the map. With the one button on the Atari 2600 controller, players make the serve.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Kultpower Archiv: Komplettscan Telematch 6/1983|url=https://www.kultpower.de/archiv/heft_telematch_1983-06_seite24|access-date=2020-10-15|website=www.kultpower.de}}</ref> Every further shot is automatic if the ball has physical contact with the player.<ref name=":0" /> For every ball that falls on the opposing playing field, players get 15 points which they can see at the top part of the screen. After they reached 30 points, they only get 10 points for each other ball. After 40 points, they won one round. The number of rounds won goes up to 6. After winning 6 rounds, a new pile is opened at the top part of the screen which again goes up to 6. The first player who won two piles of 6 rounds wins the game.<ref name=":0" />

== Development ==
The 2600 version's programmer is unknown, while the 5200 and Atari 8-bit family versions were coded by W Sean Hennessy. Atari's Director of Software George Kiss assigned the project to Hennessey knowing that he's a tennis fan. He did the 5200 version first and then ported the game to the Atari 8-bit family of [[home computer]]s later. The game was so well received that Hennessey could choose his next project, which was uncommon among new Atari employees.<ref name="Retro Gamer" />

The ball is larger in the NTSC version than the PAL version.<ref name="mania" /> The Atari 5200 version is slower than the Atari 2600 version.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=William Michael|url=http://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_10_1983-08_Fun_Games_Publishing_US|title=Electronic Fun with Computer & Games - Vol 01 No 10 (1983-08)(Fun & Games Publishing)(US)|date=2020-10-15|location=United States}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The [[intellectual property]] rights for the game passed to [[Hasbro Interactive]] and were subsequently bought by [[Infogrames]] in 2001, which was subsequently renamed Atari SA. In 2018 the game was re-released by AtGames on their ''Flashback portable'' platform.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Loguidice|first=Bill|date=2018-11-05|title=Atari Flashback Portable Game Player (2018): The Official Game List|url=https://armchairarcade.com/perspectives/2018/11/04/atari-flashback-portable-game-player-2018-the-official-game-list/|access-date=2020-07-22|website=Armchair Arcade|language=en-US}}</ref>
