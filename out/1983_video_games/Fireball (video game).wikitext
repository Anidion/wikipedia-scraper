'''''Fireball''''' is a [[Breakout (video game)|''Breakout'' clone]] video game developed by Arcadia (whose name changed to "Starpath" during development) for the [[Atari 2600]]. The game was released on [[cassette tape]] and required the [[Starpath Supercharger]] add-on to play.<ref name="Classic Home Video Games">{{cite book |last1=Weiss |first1=Brett |title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984: A Complete Reference Guide |date=2011 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0786487554 |pages=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&q=%22fire+fighter%22+%22imagic%22+%22Atari%22&pg=PA59 |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The game is similar to [[breakout (video game)|breakout]] in that the player uses a ball (a fireball, hence the name) to break-up walls made of bricks by hitting the bricks with the ball, with the shape of the walls changing as the player progresses. The game differs from [[Breakout (video game)|breakout]], however, in that rather than just being a bat, the player controls an animated [[juggler]] who can catch and throw the ball at the bricks. The game also differs from the traditional ''Breakout'' format in that six fireballs may be kept in the air at any one time, and the brick that are to be destroyed in each level are arranged in varying shapes/patterns.<ref name="Kunkel" /> Five different modes of play are provided, including "Firetrap", "Knock-a-block",  "Marching Blocks", "Migrating Blocks", and "Cascade", and as many as six balls may be on-screen at any given time.<ref name="TV Gamer">{{cite journal |title=Fireball: New! |journal=TV Gamer |date=Autumn 1983 |page=25 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/magazines/tv_gamer/tv_gamer_autumn83.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2019}}</ref>

The game may be played in single-player mode, or in a two-player mode where each player takes turns.<ref name="Classic Home Video Games" />

==Reception==
The contemporary reception to the game was broadly positive. The British ''TV Gamer'' magazine described it as "very similar to other ''Breakout'' games" though they also noted that the game was "challenging and entertaining".<ref name="TV Gamer" /> The German ''TeleMatch'' magazine gave it a positive review, praising its gameplay and graphics, and criticising only its "monotone" sound.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fireball: Evergreen - neu aufgelegt |journal=TeleMatch |date=August–September 1983 |issue=5 |pages=54–56 |url=https://archive.org/details/TeleMatch.N05.1983.08-KCz.pdf/page/n55 |accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref> ''Vidiot'' magazine described it as "the best variation on the ''Breakout'' theme yet".<ref name="Vidiot">{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Rick |title=Starpath Supercharger |url=https://archive.org/details/Vidiot_Vol_1_No_5_1983-09_CREEM_Magazine_US/page/n51/mode/2up?q=%22Fireball%22 |access-date=25 February 2021 |work=Vidiot |date=August–September 1983 |page=53}}</ref> The 1984 ''Software Encyclopedia'' was broadly positive about the game, giving it 7/10.<ref name="Kunkel">{{cite book |editor1-last=Kunkel |editor1-first=Bill |editor1-link=Bill Kunkel (journalist) |title=1984 Software Encyclopedia |date=1984 |publisher=Reese Communications Inc. |pages=105 |url=https://archive.org/details/1984_Software_Encyclopedia_Number_2_1983_Reese_Communications_US/page/n103/mode/2up?q=Soccer |access-date=25 February 2021}}</ref>

Later reviewers have been more positive about ''Fireball''. In ''Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984: A Complete Reference Guide'', Brett Weiss described in in-game action as "fun, hectic, and more than a little challenging".<ref name="Classic Home Video Games" /> Writing for ''Atari HQ'', Iida Keita also gave the game a positive review, describing the game as "very derivative and familiar to most classic videogame enthusiasts" whilst also saying that "the design does provide for some challenging and exciting play".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Iida |first1=Keita |title=AGH Atari 2600 Review: FIREBALL |url=http://www.atarihq.com/reviews/2600/fireball.html |website=AGH |accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref>
