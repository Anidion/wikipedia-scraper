''[[Ahoy!]]'' criticized the pace of the game, noting that each player had to "sit at the computer for several minutes. Other players can use this time to strategize, but things can get pretty slow. ''Oil Barons'', for all its complexity, may not keep you entertained while you are waiting."<ref name="herring198409">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_09_1984-09_Ion_International_US#page/n33/mode/2upst | title=Oil Barons | work=Ahoy! | date=September 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Herring, Richard | pages=35–37}}</ref>
