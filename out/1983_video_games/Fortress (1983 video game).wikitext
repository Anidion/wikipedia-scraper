==Gameplay==

''Fortress'' is a game in which the goal is to be the player who finishes the game with the most territory.<ref name="CGW13"/>

The game takes place on a rectangular field, where two opposing players alternate turns. For each turn, a player can either build a new castle or reinforce an existing one. If a new castle is built, it appears with four flags in each cardinal direction showing its zone of control. Players must place their castles in a way so they control most of the playing field. Because the field is limited, after a few turns there is a conflict between the opposing players where the most powerful castle wins.

When playing against the computer, there are five opponents to choose from: "The Squire" (beginner), "Lord Maginot" (the master of defense who will parry the player's moves), "Genghis Khan" (aggressive and strong), "Sir Galahad" (valiant but inexperienced), and finally "Count Vauban" (the most difficult).
