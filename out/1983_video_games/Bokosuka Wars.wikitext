{{nihongo|'''''Bokosuka Wars'''''|ボコスカウォーズ}} is a 1983 [[Action game|action]]-[[Strategy video game|strategy]] [[role-playing video game]] developed by Kōji Sumii (住井浩司) and released by [[ASCII (company)|ASCII]] for the [[Sharp X1]] computer, followed by ports to the [[MSX]], [[FM-7]], [[NEC PC-6001]], [[NEC PC-8801]] and [[NEC PC-9801]] computer platforms, as well as an altered version released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] console and later the [[Virtual Console]] service. It revolves around a leader who must lead an army in [[phalanx formation]] across a battlefield in [[Real-time game|real-time]] against overwhelming enemy forces while freeing and recruiting soldiers along the way, with each unit able to gain [[Experience point|experience]] and [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level up]] through battle. The player must make sure that the leader stays alive, until the army reaches the enemy castle to defeat the leader of the opposing forces.<ref name=1UP/><ref name=Gamasutra/>

The game was responsible for laying the foundations for the [[tactical role-playing game]] genre, or the "simulation RPG" genre as it is known in Japan, with its blend of [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] and [[strategy game]] elements.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The game has also variously been described as an early example of an [[action role-playing game]],<ref name=Gamasutra/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14762|title=Bokosuka Wars|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010101/https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14762|archive-date=2014-01-01|url-status=dead|website=[[All Media Network#AllGame|AllGame]]}}</ref> an early prototype [[real-time strategy]] game,<ref name=1UP>[http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3135870 Dru Hill: The Chronicle of Druaga] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20050119105913/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3135870 |date=2005-01-19}}, [[1UP.com|1UP]]</ref> and a unique reverse [[tower defense]] game.<ref name=Gamasutra>[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6251/gems_in_the_rough_yesterdays_.php?print=1 Gems In The Rough: Yesterday's Concepts Mined For Today], [[Gamasutra]]</ref> In its time, the game was considered a major success in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Famicom 25th, Part 17: Live from The Nippon edition|author=Jeremy Parish|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=Aug 1, 2008|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8827111&publicUserId=5379721|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629034629/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8827111&publicUserId=5379721|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-04-01}}</ref>

==Release==
Originally developed in 1983 for the [[Sharp X1]] computer, it won [[ASCII Entertainment]]'s first "Software Contest" and was sold boxed by them that year.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/x1/strategy/bokosukawars/index.html Bokosuka Wars], [[GameSpot]]</ref> An [[MSX]] port was then released in 1984, followed in 1985 by versions for the S1, PC-6000mkII, [[NEC PC-8801|PC-8801]], [[NEC PC-9801|PC-9801]], [[FM-7]] and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (the latter released on December 14, 1985).

[[LOGiN Magazine]]'s November 1984 issue featured a sequel for the X1 entitled ''New Bokosuka Wars'' with the source code included. With all-new enemy characters and redesigned items and traps, the level of difficulty became more balanced. It was also included in Tape Login Magazine's November 1984 issue, but never sold in any other form.

The PC-8801 version used to be sold as a download from [[Enterbrain]] and was ported for the [[i-Mode]] service in 2004. The Famicom version was released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] on April 8, 2008. 

A sequel, ''Bokosuka Wars II'', by Japanese developer Pygmy Studio, was released in Japan on November 10, 2016 for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2016/09/bokosuka-wars-ii-launches-november-10-japan|title=Bokosuka Wars II launches November 10 in Japan|date=13 September 2016 |publisher=Gematsu|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> A western version was released in February 2017 for Xbox One and October for PlayStation 4. A [[Nintendo Switch]] version was released on March 19, 2020 in Japan. The sequel has the option of choosing between two graphics modes: one that is similar to the two 1980's predecessors and a more modern one. It also adds several major new features including a third faction and a co-op mode for 2 players.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gematsu.com/2020/03/bokosuka-wars-ii-for-switch-launches-march-19-in-japan |title=Bokosuka Wars II for Switch launches March 19 in Japan |website=Gematsu |first=Sal |last=Romano |date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 5, 2020}}</ref>

==Plot==
In the later Famicom version, King Suren's forces have been captured and turned into trees and rocks by King Ogereth. King Suren has to release his warriors from trees and rocks, and defeat King Ogereth's forces. The allies coming from trees and rocks only appear in the Famicom version.

In the earlier X1, MSX and PC computer versions, however, the player starts with a complete army and may gain some extra knights by freeing them from prison cells, not from trees or rocks. There are no soldiers turned into objects in the original computer versions.

==Gameplay==
The player can control three [[chess]]-like units: the King, Knight, and Pawn. Pressing the D-Pad will move King Suren and his army in the desired direction. Captive soldiers are freed using a knight to break the gates in front of them. In the Famicom version, the player starts the game with only King Suren at 597m, and acquires more allies by bumping against trees, cacti, rocks, and walls using King Suren, which will restore them to their normal form.

Throughout the world of Bokosuka there are obstacles only certain characters can pass. The gates in which Soldiers are locked can only be broken by Knights. Death tiles will kill all characters except Soldiers who will remove them when they step on them. The walls at 500m, 400m, 300m, and 200m can only be broken by King Suren.

When one unit collides with another, a battle takes place. The tile will change to an icon of crossed swords and a then a B (for battle). The victory is automatically calculated by the computer based on the difference between the offensive strengths of the units.

If King Suren dies, the game ends, announcing "WOW! YOU LOSE!". When King Suren succeeds in defeating King Ogreth, the game ends with "BRAVO! YOU WIN!"

The Japanese instruction manual contains the lyrics "Onward, Bokosuka" (すすめボコスカ) to the peculiar game music, written by the programmer himself.
