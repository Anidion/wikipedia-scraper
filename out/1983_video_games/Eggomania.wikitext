'''''Eggomania''''' is an action video game released in January 1983<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/newsletters/video_game_update/video_game_update_feb83.pdf|magazine=[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]|volume=1|issue=11|title=Atari 2600 Compatible: ''Eggomania''|date=February 1983|page=3}}</ref> by [[U.S. Games]] for the [[Atari 2600]]. Similar in design to ''[[Kaboom! (video game)|Kaboom!]]'', which itself is a derivative of the arcade game ''[[Avalanche (video game)|Avalanche]]'', the objective is to catch eggs in a hat which are thrown by a [[chicken]]. 

==Gameplay==
[[File:Eggomania_Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Six green eggs falling toward the hat]]
A chicken at the top of the screen moves back and forth, dropping eggs. The [[paddle (game controller)|paddle controller]] is used to move a blue bear holding a hat over its head left and right at the bottom of the screen. The goal is to catch the eggs in the hat. At the end of each round, the player has a chance to throw the eggs they have caught back at the chicken for bonus points. The speed of the game increases as the player progresses.

The game has two difficulties; the easier variation gives the player a larger hat for catching eggs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-2600-vcs-eggomania_7302.html | title=Atari 2600 VCS Eggomania: Scans, dump, download, screenshots, ads, videos, catalog, instructions, roms}}</ref>

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Games]]'' in June 1983 called ''Eggomania'' "delightful", stating that the game improved on ''[[Kaboom! (video game)|Kaboom!]]'' and ''[[Avalanche (video game)|Avalanche]]'' as a "fully-animated delight that might even eclipse its inspiration" with "state-of-the-art graphics on the 2600".<ref name="eg198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Programmable Arcade | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=6 January 2015 | author1=Katz, Arnie | author2=Kunkel, Bill | pages=38â€“42}}</ref>
