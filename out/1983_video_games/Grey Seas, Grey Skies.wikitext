==Reception==
Jay Selover reviewed ''Grey Seas, Grey Skies'' and ''[[Fall Gelb: The Fall of France|Fall Gelb]]'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Both games are good simulations, and appear to be built on well researched data bases. They are both designed in presentation and content for the board gamer who now has a computer and wants to make use of its limited intelligence and rules adjudication abilities."<ref name="CGW14">{{cite magazine |last=Selover |first=Jay |title=Two Simulations Canada |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=February 1984 |volume=1 |issue=14 |pages=16â€“17, 45}}</ref>
