'''''Red Sea Crossing''''' is a [[Christian video game|Christian]] [[side-scrolling video game]] for the [[Atari 2600]]. Released for mail order only in 1983, its existence went unrecorded until it was discovered at a garage sale in 2007. Only two verified copies have been found, making it one of the [[Video game collecting#Rare games|rarest published video games]].

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Red Sea Crossing screenshot.png|thumb|left|Moses jumping over giant clams, while evading a [[javelin]]. The fish that represents the time limit can be seen in the top left.]][[Moses]] [[Crossing the Red Sea|parts the Red Sea]] and the player directs him between the parted waters. Moses must avoid obstacles such as [[seaweed]] and [[Giant clam|giant clams]], as well as the pursuing [[Biblical Egypt|Egyptians]], by precisely timing his movements and jumping.

A fish swimming in the water behind Moses serves as a time limit - he must [[Glossary_of_video_game_terms#Flip-screen|reach the end of the screen]] before the fish. Bonus points are awarded for collecting [[Tablets of Stone|stone tablets]] or catching [[Doves as symbols#Christianity|doves]], and a [[Staff of Moses|staff]] item awards an extra life.

The game is not known to have an ending, but the developer has claimed that it is winnable. When the player runs out of lives, the Red Sea closes up.<ref name="comp">(2017) [https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/manuals/vcs/red_sea_crossing_fan-based.pdf "Red Sea Crossing Manual (Unofficial)"]</ref>

== Development ==
In 1983, ''Red Sea Crossing'' was [[Indie game#History|developed independently]] by the self-taught programmer Steve Schustack. He self-published the game and sold it exclusively through a single magazine advertisement.<ref name=":0"/> Instead of a manual,<ref name="comp"/> the game shipped with a coloring book<ref>{{cite book |last=Durham |first=Gabe |author-link= |date=June 2, 2014 |title=Bible Adventures |url= |location= |publisher=Boss Fight Books |page= |isbn=9781940535074}}</ref> and an "explanatory" audio cassette tape, apparently recorded by [[Dale Evans Rogers]].<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Inspirational Video Concepts |title=Bible Video Game Brings Fun Home |type=full-page advertisement |url= |magazine=[[Christianity Today]] |location= |publisher= |date=October 7, 1983 |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/atari_holy_grail_moses_crossing_the_red_sea_bible_story_video_game_1983 |title=Atari 'holy grail': Moses 'Crossing The Red Sea' Bible story video game, 1983 |last=Metzger |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Metzger |date=January 15, 2014 |website=Dangerous Minds |publisher= |access-date=October 15, 2023 |quote=}}</ref>

Writing broadly about "toy" programming in his 1993 technical manual, Schustack explains:<ref>{{cite book |last=Schustack |first=Steve |author-link= |date=January 1, 1993 |title=C for Fun and Profit |url= |location=Carmel, IN |publisher=[[Sams Publishing]] |page=493 |isbn=9780672303654}}</ref>

I like the thought of my young nephews' and nieces' cute little fingers pressing keys, while [the video game's] music and animation bring smiles to their faces.}}

== Rediscovery ==
A copy was found at a [[Cincinnati]] rummage sale in 2007, and the discovery of the unattested game proved controversial. Users of the [[AtariAge]] forum identified Schustack as the developer and contacted him; he recalled advertising the game in an unspecified religious magazine. In 2011, an advertisement for ''Red Sea Crossing'' was found in a 1983 issue of ''[[Christianity Today]]'', finally verifying the game.<ref name="james">{{cite book |last=James |first=Mike |author-link= |date=February 15, 2023 |title=Smoke and Mirrors |url= |location= |publisher= Andrews UK Ltd |page= |isbn=9781837910335}}</ref><ref name="comp"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Goldfarb|first=Andrew|date=September 10, 2012|title='Holy Grail of Atari Games' Sells for $10,000|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/10/holy-grail-of-atari-games-sells-for-10000|access-date=January 9, 2022|website=IGN|language=en}}</ref>
