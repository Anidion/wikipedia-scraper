'''''Micro Mouse Goes Debugging''''' is a [[PC game|computer game]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]]. It was released by [[MC Lothlorien]] in 1983.

==Gameplay==
The premise was to control Micro Mouse around a screen which contained lines of [[BASIC]] program, some of which is missing. While Micro Mouse is replacing the code, he must avoid bugs which will try to kill you and also pinch part of the code. Micro Mouse's only form of defense was a can of data kill.

==Legacy==
MC Lothlorien produced another game of the same name in 1989 which was released by [[Mastertronic]].<ref>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0011899 Micro Mouse Goes De-Bugging (1989) on World of Spectrum]</ref> It was also released for the [[Amstrad CPC]] and the [[Commodore 64]].<ref>[http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=1666 Micro Mouse Goes De-Bugging (1989) on Lemon64]</ref> This has completely different gameplay compared to the original.  In this version, you guided Micro Mouse around a circuit board picking up parts and placing them in the correct spot.  This version was poorly received by critics.<ref>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue100/Pages/SinclairUser10000020.jpg Sinclair User review]</ref><ref>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue55/Pages/YourSinclair5500075.jpg Your Sinclair review]</ref>
