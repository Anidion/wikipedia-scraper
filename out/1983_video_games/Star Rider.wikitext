'''''Star Rider''''' is a [[racing game|racing]] [[LaserDisc video game]] developed by Computer Creations and [[Williams Electronics]], and released for [[arcade game|arcades]] in 1983. The object of the game is to win a futuristic [[motorcycle]] race that takes place in surrealistic settings.  The tracks themselves and the background graphics are video played from a [[laserdisc]], and are of higher quality than possible with real-time computer graphics at the time. The foreground graphics and racers are superimposed on the video. ''Star Rider'' has a rear view mirror&mdash;possibly the first racing game with one &mdash;which warns of opponents approaching from behind.<ref name="gorzelany"/><ref name="bigk">Arcade Alley [[Big K (magazine)|Big K]], 07 1984-Oct pp.72-73 [https://computerarchive.org/files/computer/magazines/big-k/Big_K_Issue_07_1984_Oct.pdf#page=74]</ref>

''Star Rider'' was produced in both an upright and a sit-down version where the player would sit on a replica of the cycle. It was released after the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game crash of 1983]] and was not widely distributed. According to [[Eugene Jarvis]] of Williams, ''Star Rider'' was a "major dog" and resulted in or contributed to a loss of [[US$]]50 million.<ref name="halcyon"/> The title character from ''[[Sinistar]]'' and a flying mount from ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'' make cameo appearances in the background graphics.
