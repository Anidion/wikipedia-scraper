'''''Star Wars''''' is a first-person [[rail shooter]] designed by Mike Hally<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=star-wars-upright-model&page=detail&id=2623 |title=Star Wars| publisher=arcade-history.com|access-date=2014-06-26 }}</ref> and released as an [[arcade video game]] in 1983 by [[Atari, Inc.]]<ref name = "klov">{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9773 |title=Star Wars - Atari (1983)| publisher=The International Arcade Museum|access-date=2014-06-24 }}</ref> It uses 3D color [[vector graphics]] to simulate the assault on the [[Death Star]] from the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. There are three connected gameplay sequences: combat against [[TIE fighter]]s in space, flying across the surface of the Death Star, and the final trench run. The sequence repeats with added complications and the Death Star regenerating for each. The player's [[X-Wing fighter]] has a shield which only protects against damage a certain number of times, then the next hit ends the game.

Developed during the [[golden age of arcade games]], ''Star Wars'' has been included on lists of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. Home ports were published by [[Parker Brothers]], [[Domark]], and [[Broderbund]]. It was followed by a lesser-known arcade sequel, sold as a conversion kit for the original, in 1985: ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1985 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Star wars gameplay.png|thumb|left|The first phase: combat vs. TIE fighters. The player's shield can take 6 hits.]]

Assuming the role of [[Luke Skywalker]] ("Red Five"), the player pilots an [[X-wing]] fighter from a first-person perspective. The controls consist of a [[Yoke (aeronautics)|yoke]] control with four buttons &mdash; two trigger style and two in position to be pressed by the thumbs &mdash; each of which fired a laser positioned on the four leading edges of the X-Wings.

The player does not have to destroy every [[TIE Fighter]] and gun turret in order to advance through the game; instead, the player must survive for a set length of time, either avoiding or destroying enemies and the shots they fire. The player begins with six shields, one of which is lost for every collision with an enemy or projectile. If the player loses all shields and is hit again, the game ends.

Each wave of the game consists of three attack phases, culminating in the destruction of the Death Star.

===Phase 1===
In the first phase, the "[[Imperial March]]" or another part of [[John Williams]]' ''Star Wars'' score is briefly played electronically and the player engages in a [[dogfight]] with [[Darth Vader]] and enemy [[TIE fighter]]s in outer space near the Death Star. After the TIE fighter waves, when flying towards the [[Death Star]], the yellow grid lines on the Death Star spell out either "May the force be with you" on odd-numbered waves or names of some of the developers on even numbered waves.

===Phase 2===
In the second phase, the player must fly across the surface of the Death Star to reach its equatorial trench. This section is omitted during the first wave of the game. During the second wave the player is attacked by artillery bunkers, while in the third and subsequent waves laser turrets on towers rise to confront the player. The player is awarded a bonus for destroying every turret.

===Phase 3===
In the third phase, the player must navigate the trench until finally firing a proton torpedo for a direct hit on the exhaust port target. If the player is successful, the Death Star explodes and the player is awarded a bonus shield, to a maximum of six (can be set internally for a maximum of eight). Should the player fail to hit the exhaust port, a shield is lost and the player must attempt the trench again. If the player manages to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, a bonus is awarded for "using the Force."

The game then resets to the first phase. Each successive wave greatly increases the difficulty; TIE fighters shoot more often, artillery bunkers and laser towers appear in the second phase, and obstacles appear in the trench during the third. Unlike the movie, where the units shoot beams similar to [[laser]]s, the enemy units in this game shoot projectiles resembling fireballs, which give the player a chance of destroying the shots.<ref name = "klov"/>

==Development==
Development on the game started in 1981 under the title ''Warp Speed'' and was initially headed up by Ed Rotberg (who also worked on the vector-based ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'').<ref name="NGen26">{{cite magazine|date=February 1997|title=Army Armed with Quarters!|url=https://archive.org/details/nextgen-issue-26/page/n49|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|issue=26|page=49}}</ref> Rotberg left Atari in October 1981, after which Atari signed a licensing agreement with Lucasfilm and finished the game.<ref name="NGen26"/>

==Ports==
''Star Wars'' was converted first by [[Parker Brothers]] (with development by [[Imagic]]) in 1983 and 1984 to the [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[ColecoVision]], and [[Commodore 64]]. The ColecoVision version was programmed by [[Wendell Brown]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://colecovision.dk/star-wars.htm | title=Colecovision Game Index/Star Wars| publisher= Colecovision.dk| access-date=2014-06-26}}</ref>

[[Image:StarWars Electron.gif|thumb|right|Acorn Electron conversion by Vektor Grafix]]

The same game was converted again, in 1987 and 1988, for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Acorn Electron]] and [[BBC Micro]]; the game was also converted again for the Atari 8-bits and the Commodore 64. All conversions were developed by UK-based [[Vektor Grafix]] (the Atari 8-bit version by [[Zeppelin Games]] being an exception) and were published in Europe by [[Domark]]. That same year [[Broderbund]] acquired the rights to develop Star Wars games from Lucasfilm. Broderbund published the [[Macintosh]], Commodore 64, and [[MS-DOS]] versions of the arcade game in North America in 1988, in addition to republishing the Atari ST and Amiga versions in 1989.

The [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] allow mouse control and include digitized sound effects. The Macintosh version contains sampled speech from the films, but has no in-game music other than a monophonic theme during the "attract" mode.

''Star Wars'' also appears in the [[GameCube]] game ''[[Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]'' as a bonus minigame that can be unlocked after completing a certain level or entering a [[cheat code]].  In the United States and some European countries, anyone who [[pre-order]]ed the game received a special copy of the game in which ''Star Wars'' is immediately unlocked on startup.

==Reception==
The game was Atari's top-selling [[1983 in video games|1983 arcade release]], with Atari producing 12,695 total arcade units.<ref name="atari_production99">{{cite web |title=Production Numbers |url=http://www.atarigames.com/atarinumbers90s.pdf |publisher=[[Atari]] |year=1999 |access-date=September 12, 2013 |archive-date=May 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510143012/http://www.atarigames.com/atarinumbers90s.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the United States, it topped the ''[[Play Meter]]'' arcade chart for street locations in October 1983.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Play Meter's Equipment Poll: Top Videos |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=November 15, 1983}}</ref> In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Star Wars'' on their November 1, 1983 issue as being the most successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=223|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 November 1983|page=33|lang=ja}}</ref>

''[[Compute!|COMPUTE!]]'' praised the Atari ST version of ''Star Wars'', calling it "amazing, smoothly animated".<ref name="plotkin198807">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-07-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_098_1988_Jul#page/n51/mode/2up | title=ST Star Wars | work=Compute! | date=July 1988 | access-date=10 November 2013 | author=Plotkin, David | pages=51}}</ref> The MS-DOS, Amiga, Atari ST, and Commodore 64 versions by [[Brøderbund|Broderbund Software]] were reviewed in 1989 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #145 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon145">{{cite journal|last1=Lesser|first1=Hartley|last2=Lesser|first2=Patricia|last3=Lesser|first3=Kirk|date=May 1989|title=The Role of Computers|url=https://archive.org/stream/DragonMagazine260_201801/DragonMagazine145#page/n51/mode/2up|journal=Dragon|issue=145|pages=44–53}}</ref> ''[[Macworld]]'' praised the Macintosh version's gameplay, stating that it has "fast-paced action" and is "extremely challenging in higher levels". The magazine also praised the sound effects and 3D graphics, stating that the latter "enhance the game's action and excitement". ''Macworld'' criticized the master disk-based copy protection, and the game only having three playable scenarios with "limited" replay value.<ref>{{cite magazine|last = Schwartz|first = Steven|title = Star Wars 1.0 Review|date = February 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_9002_February_1990/page/n213|magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|page = 213}}</ref>

=== Accolades ===
In 1995, [[Flux (magazine)|Flux]] magazine ranked the game 61st on their "Top 100 Video Games."<ref>{{Cite journal |date=April 1995 |title=Top 100 Video Games |url=https://archive.org/details/flux-issue-4/page/n29/mode/2up |journal=Flux |issue=4 |pages=31}}</ref> In 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' listed the arcade version as number 58 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time".

==Legacy==
''Star Wars'' arcade machines can be converted into ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1985 video game)|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' via a conversion kit.<ref name = "klov"/>

As mentioned above, a complete emulation of ''Star Wars'', along with ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'' is included as bonus content for ''[[Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]''.

In October 2019, Tastemakers LLC's Arcade1up division released a 3/4 scale recreation of the original Atari arcade cabinet featuring emulated versions of the coin-op ''Star Wars'' arcade, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'' games.

===High scores===
In 1984 Robert Mruczek scored 300 million points in 49 hours of gameplay (the world record for an individual) and in 2005, Brandon Erickson set a world endurance record of 54 hours on a single credit (with a score of 283 million).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2006_01/arts.html#2 | title=Yale Alumni Magazine: Arts & Culture | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823211919/http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2006_01/arts.html | archive-date = 2006-08-23 }}</ref>  In June 1985 Flavio Tozzi, Dave Roberts and Mike Ohren played as a team in turns for five days, two hours and 26 minutes on a single credit to attain the world record score of 1,000,000,012 points. It was verified in the September 1985 edition of the ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''. Their efforts raised money for a local charity.<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine|date=September 1985|title=Alien Bashing Record|url=https://archive.org/details/computer-video-games-magazine-047/page/n117|magazine=Computer and Video Games|issue=47|page=119}}</ref> The score counter of this game "turns over" at 100 million points.

It was decided to put the machines on a harder setting for the annual Twin Galaxies International Scoreboard/Guinness Book Masters Tournament: initial shields and no bonus shields. In the 1986 Tournament, David Palmer scored 31,660,614 points in about 7 hours, a score which was published in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' and remains the world record to this day.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.classicarcadegaming.com/wr/guinness/| title=1987 ''Guinness Book of World Records'' }}</ref>
