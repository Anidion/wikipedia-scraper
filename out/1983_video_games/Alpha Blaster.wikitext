==Gameplay==
In ''Alpha Blaster'', a derivative of ''[[Galaxian]]'' (1979), the player defends against an [[alien invasion]] fleet from the planet Alpha. Piloting a lone Federation battle cruiser, the player scores points by shooting [[flying saucer]]s and other [[spacecraft]] with a [[laser cannon]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Alpha Blaster |url=http://www.pixelageworld.it/articolo/alpha-blaster-livewire-commodore-vic-20 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130702161102/http://www.pixelageworld.it/articolo/alpha-blaster-livewire-commodore-vic-20 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 July 2013 |accessdate=31 May 2013 |year=1983 |publisher=LiveWire Software |location=[[Manchester]] |page=1 }}</ref> The craft's laser energy and fuel are limited. After surviving two waves of attacks, the player must then dodge and blast through debris as the cruiser flies through an [[asteroid belt]]. If the player passes through the asteroid belt, the cruiser docks with a supply ship to rearm and refuel. After each such cycle, the game's [[difficulty level]] increases.
