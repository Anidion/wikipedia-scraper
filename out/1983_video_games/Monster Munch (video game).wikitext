==Gameplay==
The player must guide the character of "Munchie" around the [[maze]] so that he eats all of the white dots. Munchie is pursued by [[monster]]s, which cause the character to be killed by a bolt of [[lightning]], losing one of three lives. Eating a flashing power pill turns the monsters blue, during which time Munchie is able to eat them for bonus points. A [[question mark]] occasionally appears, which can be eaten for a mystery bonus. When all the dots are eaten, the player is presented with a new, more dangerous screen.
