'''''I Want My Mommy''''' is a video game for the [[Atari 2600]] released in North America by [[Zimag]] in 1983.<ref name="atariage"/> It is a [[platform game]] (then called ''climbing games'' by the US press). The game was given the KidStuff logo on the cover art; meaning it was aimed at children under the age of nine.

[[Counterfeit|Bootleg]] versions of the game were sold under three different names: ''Apples and Dolls'' by [[:pt:Comércio de Componentes Eletrônicos|CCE]], ''Teddy Apple'' by [[Home Vision]], and ''Ursinho Esperto'' by CCE.<ref name=mania/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atariage.com/forums/topic/258068-open-sesame-vs-apples-and-dolls-vs-i-want-my-mommy/|title = Open Sesame!

==Gameplay==

The player controls Teddy, and must guide him up a six-story structure to the goal at the top. The goal of the first stage is to collect the Apple at the top, and the goal of the second is to get to the mommy at the top. After completing the two stages, the game returns to the first stage but at a higher difficulty.

Attempting to stop Teddy from reaching the top are monsters that patrol the floors of the structure. Since Teddy can't jump, he has to use [[teleportation]] [[Particle beam|beams]] to connect upward on the playing field. Monsters can be faked out by partially going up a teleporter then coming back down again.

When a player starts or completes the game, the music played is ''[[Little Brown Jug (song)|Little Brown Jug]]'' written by [[Joseph Winner]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}
