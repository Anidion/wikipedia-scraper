{{nihongo foot|'''''Congo Bongo''''',|コンゴボンゴ|Kongo Bongo|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} also known as {{nihongo foot|'''''Tip Top''''',|ティップタップ|Tippu Tappu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[platform game]] released as an [[arcade video game]] by [[Sega]] in 1983. A message in the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] indicates it was coded at least in part by the company [[Ikegami Tsushinki]].<ref>[http://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Company:Ikegami_Tsushinki Ikegami Tsushinki]</ref><ref>[http://d.hatena.ne.jp/bn2islander/20080817/1218980061 ドンキーコング裁判についてちょこっと考えてみる] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312191324/http://d.hatena.ne.jp/bn2islander/20080817/1218980061 |date=2010-03-12}}; Thinking a bit about Donkey Kong, accessed 2009-02-01</ref><ref>{{Nihongo|It started from Pong|それは『ポン』から始まった: アーケードTVゲームの成り立ち|sore wa pon kara hajimatta: ākēdo terebi gēmu no naritachi}}, {{Nihongo|Masumi Akagi|赤木真澄|Akagi Masumi}}, {{Nihongo|Amusement Tsūshinsha|アミューズメント通信社|Amyūzumento Tsūshinsha}}, 2005, {{ISBN|4-9902512-0-2}}.</ref> The game is viewed in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]], like Sega's earlier ''[[Zaxxon]]'' (1982), but does not scroll. Numerous home ports followed.

The player takes the role of a red-nosed safari explorer attempting to catch an ape named Bongo who set fire to the explorer's tent. The goal in each of the four screens is to move from the lower left corner to the location of the ape on the right or upper right. He must climb ledges, jump over water and gaps in the terrain, and avoid animal attackers.

==Gameplay==

''Congo Bongo'' has similar elements and gameplay to Nintendo's ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' from 1981, with the [[Isometric computer graphics|isometric perspective]] from Sega's ''[[Zaxxon]]'' released in Japan in early 1982. Both ''Congo Bongo'' and ''Donkey Kong'' involve primates who throw objects at the player from a vantage point atop a structure. Both games involve a large-nosed protagonist whose only ability is to jump. Both games have four different, single-screen stages The goal of the first stage in both games is to climb to the top. Even the graphics of the bonus timer are similar to ''Donkey Kong''{{'}}s.

===Stages===
#In the first stage, the hunter must avoid coconuts thrown by Bongo and he has to climb a series of cliffs to reach the ape, while at the same time shaking off three monkeys that try to throw the hunter off the mountain.
#In the second stage, the hunter must cross a swamp platform by riding on the backs of diving and swimming hippopotamuses and avoiding both poisonous snakes and scorpions.
#The third stage requires the hunter to cross a plain and crouch into holes to evade the horns of charging rhinoceroses, while climbing up large flights of stairs to proceed to the next area.
#In the fourth and final stage, the hunter crosses a second swamp that with lily pads, fish, and hippos, to reach a gate of charging rhinos that are blocking the entrance to Bongo in a [[hot tub]].

The game repeats from the first level with increased difficulty.
