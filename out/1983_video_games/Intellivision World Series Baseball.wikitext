'''''Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball''''' is a [[List of baseball video games|baseball video game]] (1983) designed by [[Don Daglow]] and [[Eddie Dombrower]], and published by [[Mattel]] for the [[Intellivision]] [[Entertainment Computer System]]. ''IWSB'' was one of the first [[sports video games]] to use multiple camera angles and present a [[2.5D|three-dimensional]] (as opposed to [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]]) perspective. It was also the first statistics-based baseball [[simulation video game|simulation game]] on a [[video game console]]; all prior console baseball games were [[Arcade genre|arcade-style]] recreations of the sport.

The game's full formal title (due to licensing requirements) was ''Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball.''  It was typically shortened to ''World Series Baseball'' in use to differentiate it from the prior Mattel baseball game.

''Intellivision World Series Baseball'' displayed the batter and pitcher from a "center field camera" view. One player chose the pitch type, while the player batting chose when to swing when to take a pitch, and whether or not to bunt.

Once the ball was hit, the game switched to a "press box camera" view, where the defensive player could control the fielders and the batting player controlled the baserunners.

When runners were on base an inset window displayed them, and the batting player could lengthen or shorten their lead and attempt to steal.

The game was originally written with a simplified version of Daglow's 1971 mainframe baseball statistical simulation program, so that the [[MLBPA]] license could be acquired by Mattel and the game would accurately simulate the play of real [[Major League Baseball]] players. For economic reasons in mid-1983, Mattel withdrew from this plan at the last minute, and the designers were forced to replace actual players with the names of the ''[[Blue Sky Rangers]]'' Intellivision game design team.

''Intellivision World Series Baseball'' is also notable for the following innovations:{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

*In-game [[play by play]] announcers, presented via Intellivoice
*Stadium [[Video game music|background music]], created by Dave Warhol (who also worked on ''Earl Weaver Baseball'' at EA)
*[[Saved game|Save/load]] in a baseball game (through a RAM chip on the cartridge) 
*Lineups based on real player stats and skin colour (although names were changed)

==History==
{{essay-like|section|date=April 2018}}

===1980-1981===
In the early 1980s, video games were based on models established either by [[Coin-op|coin-op games]]' scrolling playfields, or board games' static background images. The screen was either a stable field on which characters moved or a top-down (sometimes angled) display that scrolled horizontally, vertically or both ways across a larger virtual image. These restrictions were created by the limited memory size of early [[video game consoles]], where a single screen would use up much of the [[RAM]] storage space available in a machine, and small [[ROM cartridge|video game cartridges]] that held only 4K (later 8K or 16K) of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] memory.

Daglow was one of the original five in-house Intellivision programmers at Mattel in 1980, and had written the first known computer [[baseball]] game, ''[[Baseball (Computer Game)|Baseball]]'' on a [[PDP-10]] [[mainframe computer]] at [[Pomona College]] in {{baseball year|1971}}. After completing his first Intellivision cartridge ''[[Utopia (video game)|Utopia]]'' in [[1981 in video gaming|1981]], he was promoted to lead the Intellivision game development team at Mattel.

===1982===
While watching a baseball game on TV in the spring of {{baseball year|1982}}, Daglow realized that the Intellivision could mimic the same camera angles shown in the broadcast. He immediately wrote a proposal for a new baseball game. He received approval from group Vice President [[Gabriel Baum]] to start work. No current programmers were free, so Daglow began a search for someone qualified to create this new kind of game.

He found the right person through the job placement office of his alma mater, Pomona College. Eddie Dombrower was a programmer, animator and classically trained dancer who had invented the ''DOM [[dance notation]] system'' on the [[Apple II]] computer as a way for choreographers to record dance moves the same way composers write down music. Since ''Intellivision World Series Baseball'' would require far better animations than past video games for its TV-style display, Dombrower was considered to be a perfect fit for the job.

By October [[1982 in video gaming|1982]] Dombrower had a first screen display running, complete with another first: an inset screen to show a runner taking his lead off of first base. This was the first use of an inset or picture-in-picture display in a video game.

===1983===
Baum and Daglow showed the prototype to Mattel's marketing department, which was locked in a TV advertising war with arch-rival [[Atari]] for the position of top [[video game console]]. Although the game was not slated for completion until mid-1983, the company rushed a new TV commercial into production for Christmas, in which Intellivision spokesman [[George Plimpton]] pulled a velvet drape from a monitor and proclaimed the title to be "the future of video games." Mattel's marketing strategy was to dissuade consumers from buying Atari or [[Coleco]] consoles by showing an exclusive new style of Mattel game.

While the game had been announced by Plimpton in Christmas 1982, Danny Goodman of ''[[Radio-Electronics]]'' reported n June 1983 that the game was not ready for release yet.<ref name="RE">{{cite magazine |last1=Goodman |first1=Danny |title=Videogames '83 |magazine=[[Radio Electronics]] |date=June 1983 |page=58 |url=https://archive.org/details/RadioElectronics_422/RadioElectronics1983-06/page/n55}}</ref> The [[video game crash of 1983]] wiped out most of the market before ''Intellivision World Series Baseball'' ever shipped. Like most video games completed after the spring of 1983, it entered a toy store network that believed the video game era was over and that the games had been a passing fad.

To make matters worse, while the game could be played without the use of the [[Intellivoice]] [[Speech synthesis|voice synthesizer]] (which was already being phased out due to poorer-than-expected sales and declining user interest), it ''did'' require the then-new Intellivision [[Entertainment Computer System]] (ECS) keyboard component. Unfortunately, by the time the ECS was released, an internal shake-up at the top levels of management had shifted the company's focus away from hardware add-ons and almost exclusively towards software. As a result, the ECS was not well-promoted, and neither it nor its companion software titles sold particularly well... and since ''IWSB'' was one of the last titles made for the ECS system, very few copies were sold, making it one of the rarest Intellivision titles in the collectors' market.

Daglow and Dombrower went on to create the hit ''[[Earl Weaver Baseball]]'' game at [[Electronic Arts]] in {{baseball year|1987}}, where they more fully implemented the ideas behind ''Intellivision World Series Baseball''. This set the stage for the [[EA Sports]] product line. In the early and mid-1990s, Daglow led the development of the ''[[Tony La Russa Baseball]]'' games, further refining baseball simulations.
