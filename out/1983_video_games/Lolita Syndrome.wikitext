{{nihongo|'''''Lolita Syndrome'''''|ロリータ・シンドローム}} is a Japanese [[eroge|adult computer game]] created by Katsumi Mochizuki and distributed by [[Enix]].<ref name=fm7mus>[http://fm-7.com/museum/softhouse/enix/030500500.html ロリータ・シンドローム], FM-7 Museum</ref><ref name=moon>[http://moonspa.suppa.jp/game_lolisin.htm ロリータ・シンドローム　（ｃ）エニックス], 月のゆ</ref><ref>[http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~yek-chimera/kurorekishi.htm 某有名メーカーの黒歴史その１], 鵺の鳴く夜に</ref><ref>[http://www.8-bits.info/gamelist/PC88/tips/tips_FtHP0qtIyK58vTZ5.php ロリータ・シンドローム], 8BITS</ref> It was the winner of Enix's second bi-annual Game Hobby Program Contest. The game was released for the [[FM-7]] and [[PC-8801]] platforms on 31 October 1983.

==Plot==
The game takes place within a house called "Maison Lolita" where under-aged cartoon girls run around without clothes, and play games which involve cheating death. The player must solve puzzles in order to save the cartoon girls from violent deaths, or to see the girls without their clothes on.<ref name=erogamescape>[http://erogamescape.dyndns.org/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/memo.php?game=18169&uid=Lumis.Eterne 「ロリータシンドローム」の感想], ErogameScape</ref><ref name=cracked/> The game was not originally advertised as containing gore, and this element was only hinted at on the game's packaging:

==Development==
Prior to creating its well-known series of [[Role-playing game|role-playing games]] which include ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' and ''[[Star Ocean]]'', Enix was a niche game publisher which became involved in the creation and distribution of pornographic games during the 1980s.<ref>2009-08-27, Patrick W. Galbraith, [http://metropolis.co.jp/features/feature/love-bytes/ Love Bytes], Metropolis.co.jp</ref> ''Lolita Syndrome'' was the winning game of the second Game Hobby Program Contest sponsored by Enix.<ref name=fm7mus/><ref name=cracked>2011-02-09, [http://www.cracked.com/article_19005_6-famous-artists-you-didnt-know-were-perverts_p2.html 6 Famous Artists You Didn't Know Were Perverts], Cracked</ref> A similar game was released by Enix in February 1983, {{nihongo|''Mari-chan's Close Call''|マリちゃん危機一髪}}, which also involves gore and pornographic imagery of underage girls. The game revolves around the player protecting a teenage girl named Mariko Hashimoto from kidnappers and killers who throw knives at her, attach her to high-voltage batteries, or place her next to bombs.<ref>[http://fm-7.com/museum/softhouse/enix/030500100.html マリちゃん危機一髪], FM-7 Museum</ref><ref name=cracked/> 

''Lolita Syndrome'' was programmed and illustrated by [[manga artist]] Katsumi Mochizuki. During the game's development, Mochizuki was simultaneously an illustrator for the children's educational series {{nihongo|''Learning Manga''|学習まんが}} published by [[Shogakukan]].<ref name=pc8801>{{cite book |title=蘇るPC-8801伝説 永久保存版 |date=14 March 2006 |publisher=ASCII Books |isbn=978-4756147301 |pages=222–223 |edition=1st}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Lolita Syndrome'' developed a cult following with Japanese [[otaku]] and game collectors during the time of its original release.<ref name=pc8801/> The game was produced during the "Lolicon Boom" within the Japanese anime and manga industries, and its content reflects the stylistic choices of the era. In 1985, Mochizuki developed a sequel called {{nihongo|''My Lolita''|マイ・ロリータ}} which was released by [[Koei]].<ref name=erogeintro/> ''My Lolita'' contained tamer, less violent content but did not sell as well as its predecessor.<ref name=pc8801/>

In recent decades, ''Lolita Syndrome'' has been scrutinized for its extreme content. In 2011, American comedy magazine Cracked.com published the article "6 Famous Artists You Didn't Know Were Perverts" by Maxwell Yezpitelok, in which ''Lolita Syndrome'' was specifically mentioned as an example of Enix's history of producing adult games. Yezpitelok derided the game for its content involving "sexually suggestive toddlers", calling it "contrived" and "sadistic".<ref name=cracked/> Author Kiyoshi Tane has speculated that Enix was able to release physical copies of ''Lolita Syndrome'' due to a mainstream belief at the time that video games were mainly for adults.<ref name=erogeintro>{{cite book |last1=Miyamoto |first1=Naoki |title=Eroge: Introduction to Cultural Studies, Supplementary Revised Edition |date=15 May 2017 |publisher=Sogo Kagaku Shuppan |isbn=978-4-88181-859-6 |pages=32–36 |edition=1st}}</ref> He concludes by calling the game "the most problematic work" released by Enix.<ref name=erogeintro/>
