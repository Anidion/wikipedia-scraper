==Reception==
''[[CRASH (magazine)|Crash]]'': "An unusually addictive game for those who don't mind a bit of figuring" 72/100<ref>{{cite journal |date=February 1984 |title=Corridors of Genon |journal=[[CRASH (magazine)|Crash]] |issue=1 |pages=28}}</ref>

''[[Personal Computer Games]]'': "The 3D graphics are up to New Generations usual high standard and the sound is also very well used.  But I would say the game lacks the sort of variation which has made games like ''[[Arcadia (video game)|Arcadia]]'' and ''[[Manic Miner]]'' such big hits" 5/10 <ref>{{cite journal |date=February 1984 |title=Corridors of Genon |journal=[[Personal Computer Games]] |issue=3 |pages=49}}</ref>

''[[Sinclair User]]'': "''Corridors of Genon'' is an excellent 3D game from a master of 3D techniques.  We cannot recommend it too highly" <ref>{{cite journal |date=December 1983 |title=Corridors of Genon |journal=[[Sinclair User]] |issue=21 |pages=52}}</ref>
