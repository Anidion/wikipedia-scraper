{{nihongo foot|'''''Exerion'''''|エクセリオン|Ekuserion|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[fixed shooter]] video game developed and published by [[Jaleco]] for [[Arcade video game|arcades]] in September 1983,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Game Machine |url=http://archive.org/details/game-machine-magazine-19831015p |title=Game Machine Magazine (1983-10-15) |date=1983-10-15 |language=japanese}}</ref> and licensed to [[Taito]] for manufacture and distribution of the game in North America. The player controls a starship and must fire at enemies on the screen while avoiding projectiles. The game uses a [[pseudo-3D]] [[scrolling]] background, giving a sense of depth, and the player's ship has a sense of inertia while it is being controlled with the joystick.

''Exerion'' was ported to the [[MSX]], [[Family Computer]], and [[SG-1000]]. Two sequels were released.

''Exerion'' features [[parallax]] effects and [[inertia]] simulation. The player shoots formations of bizarre alien [[amoeba]], egg-throwing [[bird]]s and [[Pterosaur]]ic creatures, as well as [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] while flying over the surface of a planet. The player has two types of guns: a slow double shot (unlimited) and a fast single shot (limited).
