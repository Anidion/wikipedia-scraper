'''''Sorcerer's Apprentice''''' is a video game for the [[Atari 2600]], based on a sequence from the film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.

==Gameplay==
The player plays as [[Mickey Mouse]] in two different screens of play. One screen has various objects falling from the sky and he has the ability to shoot something up at them and catch certain things. The second screen involves him rushing up and down stairs trying to intercept an army of walking brooms to stop them from getting to the bottom and causing the room to flood more.

==Reception==
Randi Hacker for ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' said: "Our only hypothesis is that it instills a healthy fear of brooms and cleaning paraphernalia which means that, when the kids who play this game grow up more people will need to be employed as maids".<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Randi Hacker|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_02_No_02_1983-12_Fun_Games_Publishing_US|title=Sorcerer's Apprentice review|journal=[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]] |volume=2 |number=2 |date=December 12, 1983|page=[https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_02_No_02_1983-12_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/page/n55/ 34]|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Atari Age]]'' said that ''Sorcerer's Apprentice'' is a wonderful cartoon videogame treat for the whole family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/atariage-2-3|title=Atari Age Volume 2 Number 3|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''Video Games'' magazine said that "it's not a total disaster, but in light of the other child-oriented games recently released by Atari, especially ''Pigs in Space'' and ''Snoopy and the Red Baron'', it is a disappointment".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Volume_2_Number_08_1984-05_Pumpkin_Press_US|title=Video Games - Volume 2 Number 08 (1984-05)(Pumpkin Press)(US)|date=May 12, 1984|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
''TV Gamer'' said that "not the most difficult game ever created but then it is designed for younger gamers. The graphics are pretty good and overall the game is to be recommended to young gamers and Walt Disney fans".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/TV_Gamer_1983-09_Boytonbrook_GB|title=TV Gamer (1983-09)(Boytonbrook)(GB)|date=September 12, 1983|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
