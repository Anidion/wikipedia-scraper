{{nihongo foot|'''''Pole Position II'''''|ポールポジションII|Pōru Pojishon Tsū|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the sequel to [[Racing video game|racing]] [[Sim racing|simulation]] game ''[[Pole Position]]'', released by [[Namco]] for [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1983. As with its predecessor, Namco licensed this game to [[Atari, Inc.]] for US manufacture and distribution. [[Atari Corporation]] released a port as the [[pack-in game]] for its [[Atari 7800]] ProSystem console launch in 1986. ''Pole Position'' arcade machines can be converted to ''Pole Position II'' by swapping several chips.<ref name=klov>{{KLOV game|id=9064|name=Pole Position II}}</ref>
 
The gameplay is the same as in the original ''Pole Position'' with three additional tracks to choose from. Like its predecessor, ''Pole Position II'' was a major commercial success in arcades, becoming the highest-grossing [[1984 in video games|arcade game of 1984]] in the United States, and remaining among the annual highest-grossing arcade games in Japan and the United States [[1987 in video games|through 1987]].

==Differences from the original==
[[File:Polepos2.png|thumb|left|Approaching two other cars in a turn (arcade).]]
The player initially chooses one of four tracks using the steering wheel: [[Fuji Speedway]] (from the first game), Test (resembling [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]), Seaside (resembling the [[1982 United States Grand Prix West]] circuit in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]), and [[Suzuka Circuit]]. 

The cars have a different color scheme, the explosions now show debris, there are several new billboards, and there is a new opening theme song. The timer is displayed as "TIME" in the Japanese version (as it was in the original game), and it is displayed as "UNIT" in the American release.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Pole Position II'' on their November 15, 1983, issue as being the second most successful upright/cockpit [[arcade cabinet]] of the month,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 – アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=224|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=November 15, 1983|page=29|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19831101p.pdf#page=17}}</ref> before topping the charts in December 1983.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=225|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=December 1, 1983|page=33|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19831201p.pdf#page=17}}</ref> It was later Japan's third highest-grossing upright/cockpit [[1986 in video games|arcade game of 1986]] (below Sega's ''[[Hang-On]]'' and ''[[Space Harrier]]''),<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '86 上半期 |trans-title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: First Half '86 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=288 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=July 15, 1986 |page=28 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19860715p.pdf#page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '86 下半期 |trans-title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: Second Half '86 |magazine=Game Machine |issue=300 |publisher=Amusement Press, Inc. |date=January 15, 1987 |page=16 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19870115p.pdf#page=9}}</ref> and fifth highest-grossing upright/cockpit [[1987 in video games|arcade game of 1987]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '87 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=324 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=January 15, 1988 |page=20 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19880115p.pdf#page=11}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Pole Position II'' has been re-released as part of various ''[[Namco Museum]]'' compilations, but the two active permanent circuits were removed (because of licensing issues with both Toyota, which owns [[Fuji Speedway]], and Honda, which owns [[Suzuka Circuit]], but no licensing issues with the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach) and similar looking circuits, '''Namco Circuit''' and '''Wonder Circuit''' (after Namco's ''Wonder'' series of Japanese theme parks) were added respectively. In ''[[Namco Museum Virtual Arcade]]'', they were renamed to '''Blue''' and '''Orange''' respectively, even though neither track features the colors, although the layouts were similar.

In 2006, [[Namco Networks]] released ''Pole Position II'' for mobile phones.<ref>[http://wireless.ign.com/articles/681/681565p1.html IGN review of Pole Position II cell phone game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316153018/http://wireless.ign.com/articles/681/681565p1.html |date=March 16, 2006}}</ref>
