'''''Snoopy and the Red Baron''''' is an [[Atari 2600]] [[shoot 'em up]] featuring ''[[Peanuts]]'' character [[Snoopy]] and his aviation rival, the [[Manfred von Richthofen|Red Baron]]. It is the first video game based on ''Peanuts'' by [[Charles M. Schulz]] and was published by [[Atari, Inc.]] in 1983.

==Gameplay==
''Snoopy and the Red Baron'' is a single-player game with the player guiding [[Snoopy]] on his doghouse with four variations of difficulty to play. The objective is to shoot down Snoopy's rival, the Red Baron, controls being the stick to maneuver Snoopy and the button to fire. The game starts out with the player having four doghouses, otherwise known as lives. It takes eight hits to destroy the Red Baron, and eight hits from the Red Baron to have the player lose a doghouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=446 |title=Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Snoopy and the Red Baron (Atari) |publisher=AtariAge |date= |access-date=2013-03-24}}</ref>

An alternative notion is to collect "treats" the Red Baron drops while falling, and to avoid skulls and crossbones. Touching the skulls and crossbones or being shot down will undo the player's progress in collecting treats. If the player collects all of the treats and downs all of the Red Barons, bonus points are rewarded. A Gold Baron is earned when the player downs fifty Red Barons.

In the game, the Red Baron often flies above the clouds; however, Snoopy cannot fly above the clouds in the play set. An exclamation mark appears whenever one million points are scored.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Release==
''Snoopy and the Red Baron'' was released in 1983. This game play-tested better than the [[Atari 2600]] game ''Bugs Bunny'', therefore ''Bugs Bunny'' was shelved, allowing ''Snoopy and the Red Baron'' to enter the market.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The game was released with a [[Children's Computer Workshop]] cartridge label, which was used on very few games for the [[Atari 2600]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atariage.com/label_page.php?LabelID=13 |title=Atari 2600 Label Variations - Atari - Children's |publisher=AtariAge |date= |access-date=2013-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atariage.com/cart_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=446 |title=Atari 2600 Cartridge Scans - Snoopy and the Red Baron (Atari) |publisher=AtariAge |date= |access-date=2013-03-24}}</ref> ''Snoopy and the Red Baron'' was the only released game in Atari, Inc.'s ''Peanuts'' series, having a planned but unreleased game titled ''Good Luck, Charlie Brown''.<ref>{{cite web |date= |title=Atari 2600 - Good Luck, Charlie Brown (Atari) |url=https://www.atariage.com/software_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=837 |access-date=2013-03-24 |publisher=AtariAge}}</ref>
