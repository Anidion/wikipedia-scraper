'''''Repton''''' is a ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]''-inspired [[scrolling shooter]] written by Dan Thompson and Andy Kaluzniacki for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Sirius Software]] in 1983.<ref name="giantlist">{{cite web|title=The Giant List of Classic Game Programmers|url=https://dadgum.com/giantlist/ |last1=Hague |first1=James}}</ref> It was ported to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], and [[Commodore 64]].

==Gameplay==
The player controls a fighter ship sent to stop a fleet of invading aliens from building an attack base on the planet Repton. The ship is equipped with lasers and a limited number of [[atomic weapon|nukes]] that can destroy all enemies on the screen. The player can use an invulnerable shield for defense, but cannot steer or fire while it is up. If the player puts the shield up while moving, the ship will coast to a stop. In addition, a radar screen indicates the location of enemies on the planet surface.

Each level of the game is played in two parts. During the surface attack, the player fights enemies in order to delay the construction of the base. "Warning" messages indicate that a fresh wave of enemies is arriving, while an "Alert" tells of an attempt to siphon energy from the planet. If the player can fly through the enemy's energy beam in time, then pass through a charging station, the energy will be returned to the planet; otherwise, it will go into building the base.

Once the base is completed, the planet's defenses trigger a bomb that destroys the entire surface and the action shifts to the caverns, where the radar does not function. Here, the player must dodge enemy attacks and eventually destroy the base's power core, after which the next level begins with increased difficulty.

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' in 1983 called ''Repton'' "the latest in ultra-fast action arcade games", praising its "faultless animation".<ref name="shore198301">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=6&id=9 | title=Repton | work=Softline | date=January 1983 | accessdate=27 July 2014 | author=Shore, Howard A. | pages=42}}</ref> ''Video'' reviewed the Apple II version of the game in its "Arcade Alley" column where it was described as "pure excitement from start to finish", noting that extra features enhance gaming experience.

==Legacy==
In 2011, Kaluzniacki released a version of ''Repton'' for the [[iPhone]]. It uses high-resolution visuals instead of [[pixel art]], which [[Jeff Minter]] criticized for losing the flavor of the original.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Minter|first1=Jeff|title=Is higher rez always better?|url=http://minotaurproject.co.uk/blog/?p=165|website=Llamasoft}}</ref>
