==Gameplay==
{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2022}}
[[File:ARC Sinistar.png|thumb|left|The player's ship, left of center, below a Warrior and partially obscured by a just-released Sinibomb.]]

The player pilots a lone [[spacecraft]], flying through a large region of space, part of which is shown on the [[mini-map]] at the top of the screen. Shooting drifting [[asteroid|planetoids]] releases small, white [[crystals]]. When collected, each crystal turns into a "Sinibomb", which is the weapon for defeating the [[Boss (video games)|end of level boss]], Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic [[skull]] face. A planetoid contains a limited number of crystals; shooting it too rapidly causes it to explode.

Sinistar does not exist at the start of a level, but is constructed by red enemy worker ships. Workers cannot hurt the player, but they compete to collect crystals to build the Sinistar. Warrior ships directly attack the player's ship, shoot planetoids to mine crystals, and guard the Sinistar while it is being built. It takes 20 crystals to create the 20 pieces of a completely built Sinistar, but only 13 Sinibombs to destroy it. The 7 pieces making up the face are considered a single piece once Sinistar is active.

When the Sinistar is complete, its [[Speech synthesis|digitized voice]] announces "Beware, I live" and Sinistar chases the player's ship while making threatening remarks: "Run! Run! Run!", "Beware, coward!", "I hunger!", "Run, coward!", and a loud roar. It has no weapons, but it destroys the player's ship on contact, after which it sometimes proclaims "I am Sinistar". A dedicated button releases a Sinibomb which automatically targets the Sinistar. A Sinibomb can be intercepted mid-flight by Workers, Warriors, and planetoids. Successfully damaging the Sinistar causes angry roaring.

The player warps to a new zone each time ''Sinistar'' is defeated. The unnamed first zone is followed by the Worker Zone, Warrior Zone, Planetoid Zone, and Void Zone, then it cycles back to the Worker Zone. Each zone emphasizes a particular game feature, with the Void Zone having fewer planetoids. In all but the first zone, a completed but damaged ''Sinistar'' can be repaired by enemy Workers, extending its lifespan if the player is unable to kill it quickly.

==Development==
''Sinistar'' was the first game with [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] sound (in the sit-down version), with two independent front and back sound boards for this purpose. It also uses a 49-way optical [[joystick]] that Williams produced specifically for this game.<ref name=S/>

The voice of Sinistar was recorded by radio personality [[John Doremus]]<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1707880/ Internet Movie Database]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}</ref> and played through an HC-55516 [[Continuously variable slope delta modulation|CVSD]] decoder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maws.mameworld.info/minimaws/set/trog|title=MAME 0.36b7 changelog|publisher=|access-date=2011-10-03|archive-date=2011-10-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007113335/http://maws.mameworld.info/minimaws/set/trog|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=610|title=System 16 - Williams/Midway Y Unit Hardware (Midway)|website=www.system16.com}}</ref>

''Sinistar'' contains a [[software bug|bug]] that grants the player many lives (ships). It happens only if the player is down to one life and the ''Sinistar'' is about to eat the player's ship. If a warrior ship shoots and destroys the ship at this moment, it immediately takes the player to zero lives, and the ''Sinistar'' eating the player subtracts another life. Since the number of lives is stored in the game as an 8-[[bit]] [[Signedness|unsigned integer]], the subtraction from zero will cause the integer to [[integer overflow|wrap around]] to the largest value representable with 8 bits, which is 255 in decimal.<ref>[[Noah Falstein]] interview, ''Williams Arcade Classics'' CD-ROM for DOS and Microsoft Windows, Williams Entertainment, 1996</ref>

The [[Motorola 6809|6809]] source code for ''Sinistar'' is available at https://github.com/historicalsource/sinistar.

== Reception ==
In 1995, ''[[Flux (magazine)|Flux]]'' magazine ranked ''Sinistar'' 72nd on their Top 100 Video Games. They praised the game calling it a "truly harrowing" arcade classic.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=April 1995 |title=Top 100 Video Games |url=https://archive.org/details/flux-issue-4/page/n29/mode/2up |journal=Flux |publisher=Harris Publications |issue=4 |pages=31}}</ref>

==Legacy==
There were no contemporary ports of ''Sinistar''. Versions for [[Atari 2600]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/sinistar/sinistar.htm |title=Sinistar (Atari 2600) |last=Reichert |first=Matt |work=AtariProtos.com |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> and the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] were in progress,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/8bit/software/sinistar/sinistar.htm |title=Sinistar (Atari 8-bit) |last=Reichert |first=Matt |work=AtariProtos.com |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> but not completed.

===In popular culture===
Sinistar is referenced in various non-video-game media. The [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]] song "Grand Ol' Party Crash" samples Sinistar. The film ''[[We Are the Strange]]'' uses "Beware, I live", "I hunger", "Run, coward", and Sinistar's roar. Sinistar makes several appearances in the [[webcomic]] ''[[Bob the Angry Flower]]'', and also appears as the title of one of the print editions of the comic. Sinistar appears in the DVD version of the ''[[South Park]]'' episode trilogy "[[Imaginationland (disambiguation)|Imaginationland]]". The sound bite "Beware, coward" was used in the theme tune to the British [[Channel 4]] video-game TV show ''[[Bits (TV series)|Bits]]''.<ref>{{Citation|last=DKTronics70|title=Bits Series 1 Part 1|date=2008-06-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6mcf9t3GFw|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714195318/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6mcf9t3GFw&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=2012-07-14|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref> The audio version of podcast ''[[IGN]] Game Scoop'' uses the sound bite "Beware, I live" in its theme tune.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://player.fm/series/game-scoop|title=Game Scoop!|last=FM|first=Player|website=Game Scoop!|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref> The game was featured prominently in the music video for the [[Sheena Easton]] song "[[Almost Over You]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugl3pd8LUhA |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/Ugl3pd8LUhA| archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|title=Sheena easton - Almost over you - 1983 |last=lolymaslol|date=9 September 2010 |access-date=12 April 2018|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Sinistar himself is name-dropped and various lines of his are quoted in Stage 42 of [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion chapters#Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project|Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project]].

''Sinistar'' receives a large reference in chapters 30 and 31 of the Dresden Files book ''[[Ghost Story (The Dresden Files)|Ghost Story]]'', a 2011 novel in the Dresden Files series by [[Jim Butcher]], during a recollection of a demonic battle from the protagonist's youth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jim-butcher.com/books/dresden/ghost-story|title=Ghost Story|date=27 December 2010|language=en|access-date=2020-12-07}}</ref>
