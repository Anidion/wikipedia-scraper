'''''Mega Zone''''' is an overhead [[vertically scrolling shooter]] released as an [[arcade video game]] by [[Konami]] in 1983. ''Mega Zone'' is similar to ''[[Xevious]]'', where the player flies over a landscape of rivers and trees and futuristic enemy emplacements. There are both aerial and ground targets, but unlike ''Xevious'' both can be destroyed with the same weapon. At certain points the player can choose either the left or right fork of a branching path.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8661|title=Mega Zone video game|publisher=[[Killer List of Videogames]]|accessdate=2010-07-14}}</ref>
