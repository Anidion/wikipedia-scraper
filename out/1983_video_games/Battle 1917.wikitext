==Reception==
Russell Clarke reviewed ''Battle 1917'' for ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' #54, and stated that "Perhaps because every victory is viewed equally with no opportunity for personal betterment. Its claim to be the machine age's answer to Chess can safely be ignored. Good value though!"<ref name="WD54">{{cite journal  | last =Clarke | first =Russell | title =Microview  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | issue = 54  | pages =18â€“19  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  | date = June 1984  }}</ref>
