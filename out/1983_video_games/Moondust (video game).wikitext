==Gameplay==
[[Image:Moon dust 01.gif|thumb|left|Screenshot of gameplay.]]
''Moondust'''s gameplay is characterized by graphical complexity,<ref>Burkeman, Oliver. ''[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/dec/29/games.academicexperts The virtual visionary]''. [[The Guardian]]. 29 December 2001.</ref> and the game features an abstract ambient score.<ref>Silfer, Kyle. ''[http://alibi.com/index.php?story=19721&scn=feature Applied Ludology - Art games and game art]''. Alibi. Volume 16, Number 28. 12–18 July 2007.</ref> The goal of the game is to cover the bullseye at the center of the screen with "moonjuice." To do this, the player controls [[astronaut|spaceman]] Jose Scriabin (named in honor of [[synaesthetic]] composer [[Alexander Scriabin]])<ref name=blakeman>{{cite magazine| last=Blakeman |first=Mary Claire |title=The Art Side of Video Games - Moondust: Music Of Your Own Making |magazine=Video Games |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=27–30 |date=January 1984}}</ref> as he drops a seed square and then moves around the screen in arcing paths to run over the seed, smearing it to cover the bullseye. As Jose travels, flight patterns of he and the bullet-shaped [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s he must avoid are created and as they pass through the trails that are created, and as the moonjuice spreads and smears, the musical score is modified according to a generative algorithm.<ref>{{cite magazine| last=Brownstein |first=Mark |title=Computer Corner - The Year in Review: Shockwaves in the Computer Industry - Moondust |magazine=Video Games |issue=5 #17 |volume=2 |page=65 |date=February 1984 |issn=0733-6780}}</ref> In-game scoring system assigns point-values according to an algorithm when the level is completed. Players start with three seeds but may acquire more if they have scored highly enough.<ref name=blakeman/> The game has been compared to the works of [[Jeff Minter]].<ref>''[http://www.mayhem64.co.uk/reviews.htm Moondust ]''. MayhemUK Commodore 64 Archive review. Retrieved 9 November 2008.</ref>

The game features 4 modes: Beginner, Evasive, Freestyle, and Spinsanity. In Beginner mode, the seeds that Jose must smear remain in one position wherever they had been dropped. In Evasive mode, however, the seeds seek to evade Jose by rushing to the edge of the screen. Freestyle mode greatly increases the player’s control over Jose, removing the physical element of momentum to connect Jose's motions directly to the joystick controller's. In Spinsanity mode, the spaceships travel in a spiral pattern making smearing of the seed more difficult for the player.<ref name=blakeman/>

==Reception==
''[[Ahoy!]]''{{'}}s review began "And now for something completely different. You have never seen anything like ''Moondust'' ... No mazes, no nuke the alien aggressors, no 'find ring, sit on ring'". The magazine, which gave the game a grade of B for graphics and A for gameplay, stated that it was "not for everybody", warning that "the instructions are confusing. Even the people at Creative Software didn't know what Lanier was up to". The review nonetheless concluded "Players shopping for a non-violent game that incorporates graphics and music will want to consider ''Moondust'' ... I recommend it".<ref name="michaels198401">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_01_1984-01_Ion_International_US#page/n51/mode/2up | title=Moondust | magazine=Ahoy! | date=January 1984 | access-date=27 June 2014 | issue=1 | author=Michaels, R. J. | pages=52}}</ref> ''The Commodore 64 Home Companion'' agreed on ''Moondust''{{'}}s uniqueness, describing it as "one of the most creative new games I've seen for any computer". Describing gameplay as "more like ballet than combat", the book concluded that it "is a computer game for people who don't like computer games".<ref name=C64HC>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/The_Commodore_64_Home_Companion#page/n169/mode/2up |first=George |last=Beekman |publisher=Datamost |isbn=0-88190-294-2 |chapter=Chapter 6 — The Marvelous Toy: Recreational and Educational Software |title=The Commodore 64 Home Companion|year=1984|access-date=August 19, 2016|pages=169–170}}</ref>
