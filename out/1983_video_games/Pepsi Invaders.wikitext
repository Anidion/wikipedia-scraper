'''''Pepsi Invaders''''' (erroneously identified as '''''Coke Wins''''' and '''''Coke Invaders''''') is a non-commercially released 1983 [[fixed shooter]] video game developed by [[Atari, Inc.]] for the [[Atari 2600]]. It was commissioned by [[The Coca-Cola Company]] to be handed out to salespeople at their 1983 sales convention. A [[Skin (computing)|reskin]] of the system's version of ''[[Space Invaders (Atari 2600 video game)|Space Invaders]]'', the player shoots down a flying formation of letters spelling "[[Pepsi|PEPSI]]", [[Cola wars|Coca-Cola's long-time rival]]. Only 125 copies were distributed.

==Gameplay==
{{see also|Space Invaders#Gameplay}}
[[File:Pepsiinvaders.png|thumb|left|The "PEPSI" formation is clearly legible when the game starts.]]
The game is a modification of ''[[Space Invaders (Atari 2600 video game)|Space Invaders]]'', with nearly identical gameplay, but with a number of tweaks. Instead of having limited lives and no time limit as in the original, ''Pepsi Invaders'' has unlimited lives and a three-minute time limit to complete as many waves of enemies as possible. If any invaders successfully traverse the lowest row, instead of the formation dropping to the ground and ending the game, it merely moves left and right until all the lowest row invaders are destroyed. It is therefore impossible to lose the game.

Primary graphic changes affected the invaders, each row of which consists of the letters "'''P''' '''E''' '''P''' '''S''' '''I'''" followed by a single alien, instead of the original six aliens per row.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carless |first=Simon |url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/05/the_rarest_atari_2600_games.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113001815/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/05/the_rarest_atari_2600_games.php |archive-date=January 13, 2019 |title=The Rarest Atari 2600 Games... Evah! |publisher=GameSetWatch |date=2007-05-13 |access-date=2010-06-23}}</ref> The letters move up and down as they march but do not otherwise animate. The UFO was changed to look like a flattened [[Pepsi Globe|Pepsi logo]] in brand colors. A timer was added, displayed on the ground, which itself has been changed to a Coca-Cola-like brown color.<ref name="Bogost" /> An additional band of the same color frames the score at the top, with the word "COKE" prominently displayed to the left of the score. The player cannon now features two bands of the same brown color.

During the last 10 seconds, the timer and cannon limit indicators blink. When the time runs out, all invaders and UFOs disappear, the score changes to the word "WINS" (thus making the row read  "COKE WINS!"), and the player cannon and all texts flash rapidly. The player's final score can be seen in the attract mode after the game ends.

==Development==
''Pepsi Invaders'' was commissioned by [[The Coca-Cola Company]] to be handed out to 125 executives at their 1983 sales convention along with an Atari 2600 console. It was developed by Atari, Inc. as a modification of the original ''Space Invaders'' cartridge.<ref name="omarzu"/><ref name="Bogost">{{cite book | author = Ian Bogost | title = Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2007 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/persuasivegamese00bogo/page/276 276–277, 391] | isbn = 978-0-262-02614-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/persuasivegamese00bogo/page/276 | author-link = Ian Bogost }}</ref> Due to the original ''Space Invaders'' Atari 2600 developer Rick Maurer leaving Atari over payment issues, Atari tasked designer Christopher Omarzu with hacking the original.<ref name="retrogamer"/><ref name="omarzu"/>

Writer Matthew S. Eastin notes it as an early example of an [[advergame]]–an advertisement game–and discussed how it was more an attack on a competitor than an advertisement by the company who had it made.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pY2SszHlFA4C |title=Handbook of Research on Digital Media and Advertising: User Generated Content Consumption: User Generated Content Consumption |page=438 |publisher=IGI Global |year=2010 |last=Eastin |first=Matthew S. |isbn=978-1605667935 |access-date=August 22, 2019}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' included it in its list of the best product placement video games, similarly noting it as an early example of this and a "mischievous" marketing attempt.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/03/six-of-the-best-product-placement-video-games |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817114415/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/03/six-of-the-best-product-placement-video-games |archive-date=August 17, 2019 |title=Six of the best product placements in video games |work=[[The Guardian]] |last=Freeman |first=Will |date=July 13, 2014 |access-date=August 22, 2019}}</ref> ''[[PC Format]]'' felt the marketing was smart, comparing it to ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/the-many-faces-of-in-game-advertising-711109 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817114414/https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/the-many-faces-of-in-game-advertising-711109 |archive-date=August 17, 2019 |title=The many faces of in-game advertising |work=TechRadar |last=Gera |first=Emily |date=August 22, 2010 |access-date=August 22, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' was critical of ''Pepsi Invaders'' due to the letters not moving downward as the ships do in ''Space Invaders''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/pepsi-invaders/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803042141/http://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/pepsi-invaders/ |archive-date=August 3, 2015 |title=Pepsi Invaders |work=[[Retro Gamer]] |last=Maris |first=Peter |date=January 20, 2011 |access-date=August 22, 2019}}</ref>
