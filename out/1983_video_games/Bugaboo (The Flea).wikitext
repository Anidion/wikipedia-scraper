Its publication marked the beginning of the [[Golden Era of Spanish Software]]. A sequel was released in Spain by [[Opera Soft]] under the title ''Poogaboo'', made by Paco Suarez. Paco Portalo,<ref>[http://www.ati.es/novatica/2015/231/Nv231-99.pdf Francisco Portalo and Eduardo Mena, "Los videojuegos como paradigma de innovación en los orígenes de la industria del software español", Novática, ISSN 0211-2124, number 231, pp. 99-106, Enero-Marzo 2015 (Spanish)]</ref> the other member of Paco & Paco, left the project after the publication of the original game for the ZX Spectrum.

The player takes control of a flea who has fallen into a cavern and must escape.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Bugaboo (The Flea) Spectrum Screenshot.gif|left|thumb|Bugaboo at the bottom of the screen with the dragon approaching from the left (ZX Spectrum).]]

The game begins with an animation depicting Bugaboo, a small, yellow creature with two extremely long legs, jumping around on a colourful planet before accidentally falling through a crack in the planet's surface and falling to the bottom of a cavern.

The player must control Bugaboo and guide him back to the top of the cavern, and out to the safety of the planet's surface.

There are only two control keys: left and right. When a key is held down a gauge at the bottom of the screen begins to fill up. When the key is released, Bugaboo will jump in that direction, with the strength of the jump being determined by how long the key was held down. The cavern is made up of various rocky ledges which Bugaboo may land on, but he can only stand on a flat area and, if a jump is mistimed, Bugaboo may end up on an angled area of rock, or miss the ledge altogether, which will cause him to fall straight down, landing on whatever is below.

Bugaboo can fall from any distance without dying. The only way to lose a life is for Bugaboo to make contact with the large, yellow dragon which wanders around the cave. Bugaboo can escape the dragon by carefully leaping away, or by taking refuge inside one of the smaller caverns that are located around the play area.<ref name="CRASH_Review">{{Citation|title=Bugaboo (The Flea) Review|newspaper=[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]|date=February 1984}}</ref><ref name="PCGames_Review">{{Citation|title=Bugaboo (The Flea) Review|newspaper=[[Personal Computer Games]]|date=February 1984}}</ref><ref name="CVG_Review">{{Citation|title=Bugaboo (The Flea) Review|newspaper=[[Computer and Video Games]]|date=April 1984}}</ref>
