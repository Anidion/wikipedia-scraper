'''''M*A*S*H''''' is an [[action game]], based on the [[M*A*S*H_(film)|film]],<ref name=gamasutra>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130307/video_games_first_space_opera_.php?page=3 |title=Video Games' First Space Opera: Exploring Atari's Star Raiders |work=[[Gamasutra]] |last=Fleming |first=Jeffrey |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=September 12, 2020}}</ref> written for the [[Atari 2600]] and published by Fox Video Games in 1983. It was designed and programmed by [[Doug Neubauer]].<ref name=gamasutra /> Ports to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[VIC-20]], [[TI-99/4A]], [[Intellivision]], and [[ColecoVision]] followed.

==Gameplay==

Players are tasked with controlling a [[helicopter]] and [[army]] [[physician|doctor]]s at varying points, with the [[Mobile army surgical hospital (United States)|mobile army surgical hospital]] (M*A*S*H) team rescuing wounded to take back to the M*A*S*H 4077. The TI-99/4A version is compatible with the speech synthesizer peripheral, and at times characters say phrases aloud, such as "butterfingers."<ref name="cavg">{{cite magazine |title=M*A*S*H |magazine=Computer And Video Games |date=June 1985}}</ref>

==Development==
''M*A*S*H'' began development as part of an initiative by Frank O'Connell and Paul Carter, who collaborated to create the studio Fox Video Games in April 1982. The company pushed "aggressively" to create and market home video games. O'Connell stated that his first major acquisition was getting the rights to make a ''M*A*S*H'' video game.<ref name="Connell"/>

==Release==
''M*A*S*H'' received heavier promotion than other titles released by Fox Video, and was promoted under Fox's "Games of the Century" banner.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Electronic Games |title=M*A*S*H |volume=1 |issue=15 |date=May 1983}}</ref> [[Jamie Farr]], who portrayed [[Maxwell Klinger]] on the [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|''M*A*S*H'' TV series]], was the official spokesperson for the video game.<ref name="farr">{{cite magazine |title=Six For The 4077 |magazine=[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]] |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=April 1983}}</ref>

In late 1983, O'Connell announced that the price of the game would be cut by half because of an oversaturated Atari 2600 game market.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Fox Lowers Cost of MASH |magazine=Electronic Games |volume=2 |issue=9 |date=November 1983 |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_02_Number_09_1983-11_Reese_Communications_US/page/n11/mode/2up}}</ref>

==Reception==
Marc Berman for ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' felt the game trivialized the war; they found it "heartless" given how "gruesome" the war was, and that lacking the humanity present in the show and film. Despite this, Berman still found the gameplay "terrific."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_10_1983-08_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/page/n59/mode/2up |title=M*A*S*H |magazine=[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]] |last=Berman |first=Marc |date=August 1983 |accessdate=September 11, 2020}}</ref> The reviewer for the ''Addison-Wesley Book Of Atari Software 1984'' found the game boring, agreeing with Berman that the lack of the show's humor and personalities was a problem.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/addison-wesley-book-of-atari-software-1984/page/n391/mode/2up |title= Addison Wesley Book Of Atari Software 1984 |last1=Stanton |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Wells |first2=Robert P. |last3=Rochowansky |first3=Sandra |last4=Mellin |first4=Michael |date=1984 |publisher= Book Company |accessdate=September 11, 2020 |isbn=9780201164541}}</ref> An author for ''[[Computer And Video Games]]'' felt that the visuals and audio were "well simulated," though found that controlling a scalpel using a joystick was less responsive than it was on a keyboard.<ref name="cavg"/> Lisa Honden for ''[[Electronic Games]]'' found it decent to play, but said that it was not very "innovative."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_02_Number_12_1984-05_Reese_Communications_US/page/n79/mode/2up?q=M*A*S*H|title = Electronic Games - Volume 02 Number 12 (1984-05)(Reese Communications)(US)|date = May 1984}}</ref>
