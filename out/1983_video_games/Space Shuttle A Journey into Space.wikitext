The player controls the most critical flight phases of the [[Space Shuttle]] such as launch, stabilizing orbit, docking, deorbit burn, reentry, and landing, each with its own set of instructions to follow.<ref name=ad/> The original [[Atari 2600]] version came with an overlay since it made use of all the switches.<ref>[http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/spaceshuttle/spaceshuttle.htm AtariProtos.com - All Your Protos Are Belong To Us!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Reception==
In an April 1984 review for ''Video Games'' magazine, Dan Persons wrote:
<blockquote>''Space Shuttle'' is not a game for everybody. It requires a considerable amount of patience and, perhaps not too surprisingly, a considerable amount of brainpower. Players who seek the visceral thrills of the standard shoot'em-up may ultimately find this simulation's complexity frustrating. But those of you who are ready for a richer, more sophisticated experience will probably recognize ''Space Shuttle'' for the monumental achievement it is.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Persons|first1=Dan|title=Space Shuttle|journal=Video Games|date=April 1984|volume=2|issue=7|pages=58â€“59|url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Volume_2_Number_07_1984-04_Pumpkin_Press_US#page/n57/mode/2up}}</ref></blockquote>
