'''''Enduro''''' is a [[racing video game]] designed by Larry Miller for the [[Atari 2600]] and published by [[Activision]] in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]]. The object of the game is to complete an [[endurance]] race, passing a certain number of cars each day to continue the next day. The visuals change from day to night, and there is occasional inclement weather. 

Miller previously wrote games for Apple computers and the Atari 2600, such as ''[[Spider Fighter (video game)|Spider Fighter]]'' for Activision. Influenced by his own experience of driving through California, Miller made the game in about three months with 100-hour weeks.

''Enduro'' was released for the Atari 2600 in May 1983 and later ported to the [[ZX Spectrum]]. It became the top selling console game of the month by June 1983 and received positive reviews from publications like ''[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]'' and ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' with both contemporary and retrospective reviews referring to it as the best racing game on the Atari 2600.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Enduro_Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot]]
''Enduro'' consists of maneuvering a [[race car]] in the National Enduro, a long-distance endurance race. The object of the race is to pass a certain number of cars each day. Doing so will allow the player to continue racing for the next day. The driver must avoid other racers and pass 200 cars on the first day, and 300 cars with each following day.<ref name="instructions">{{cite book|year=1983|title=Enduro Instruction Booklet | publisher=Activision| id=AX-026-03}}</ref>

As the time in the game passes, visibility changes as well. When it is night in the game the player can only see the oncoming cars' taillights. As the days progress, cars will become more difficult to avoid as well. Weather and time of day are factors in how to play. During the day the player may drive through an icy patch on the road which would limit control of the vehicle, or a patch of fog may reduce visibility.<ref name="instructions"/>

If a player succeeds in racing five days or more, an on-screen racing trophy pops up. At the time of release, if the player sent a photograph of this achievement to Activision, they received a patch declaring them an "Activision Roadbuster".<ref name="instructions"/>

==Production==
Prior to designing ''Enduro'', Miller had previously developed games for Apple computers as well as ''[[Spider Fighter]]'' for the Atari 2600 while working for Activision.{{sfn|Jon|1983}}{{sfn|Bechtold|1983|p=7}}  On speaking of the difference between the two, he focused on the Atari 2600 as he said that his games are "very fast-action [...] I couldn't do that for Apple because the action is severely limited. You can get more detail on the screen, but not the really fast action."{{sfn|Bechtold|1983|p=7}}

Miller described his game design progress as having a game brewing in his mind until he started to think how the game should look and what is available on the machine before developing an outline. This is followed by about a month of getting the nuts and bolts of writing computer code. Miller was influenced to make ''Enduro'' as he does a lot of driving in California through fog, sunny weather snow and ice and wanted to make what he described as a "realistic driving game."{{sfn|Jon|1983}} 

''Enduro'' was developed on entirely on an Apple Computer and coded entirely in [[Assembly language]] in about three months with 100-hour weeks. The game has a four-[[kilobyte]] [[Read-only memory|ROM chip]].{{sfn|Jon|1983}} Miller said there were very serious limitations he could have in graphics which led to a lot of trade-offs. He opted to put in imagery he believed would be most pleasing such as the road curving, mountains in the distance. Miller said "it was extremely difficult to put those in and it just wasn't possible to put anything else in."{{sfn|Jon|1983}}

The game was later ported the [[ZX Spectrum]] by James Software.{{sfn|Crash|1984|ref=Crash}}

==Release==
''Enduro'' was released in May 1983 for the Atari 2600.{{sfn|The Video Game Update includes Computer Entertainer|1983a|ref=VGU-AU}} In June 1983, it was the top selling video game of the month by June 1983.{{sfn|The Video Game Update includes Computer Entertainer|1983|ref=VGU-TO-June1983}}

The second prize was a [[Datsun 200SX]] Hatchback SL, the third prize was a trip for two to Caesars Palace Grand Prix Weekend, the fourth prize was one of 50 [[radio controlled cars]], the fifth prize was one of 500 Activision ''[[Grand Prix (video game)|Grand Prix]]'' video game cartridges, and the sixth prize was one of 2,000 Datsun Racing posters.<ref>[http://www.atariage.com/2600/ads/enduro_contest.jpg Enduro Race-For-Riches Sweepstakes ad]</ref>

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, an anonymous reviewer in ''[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]'' described it as an "extremely impressive auto racing game. It's one of those rare games that elicited comments from our staff like "Wow-this is incredible!"{{sfn|The Video Game Update|1983|ref=VGU-A26}}
The review complimented it's addicting gameplay and that "the game was "far superior to existing race games for the 2600 because it makes you part of the action."{{sfn|The Video Game Update|1983|ref=VGU-A26}} Michael Blanchet stated they generally disliked sports and racing games, but said "after playing ''Enduro''. I'm ready to alter my opinion."{{sfn|Blanchet|1983|p=52}} Blanchet found it comparable to the [[ColecoVision]] game ''[[Turbo (video game)|Turbo]]'', appreciating the game took place on a track that curves and bends opposed to a straight rode.{{sfn|Blanchet|1983|p=52}} Blanchet concluded that the game was "the best [Atari 2600] driving game I've seen yet-bar none."{{sfn|Blanchet|1983|p=52}} A review in ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' echoed these statements, calling it a remarkable driving game and an "outstanding achievements for this system."{{sfn|Hochberg|Schmittberger|1983}} The review noted the realistic graphics and sound combined created a realistic illusion of depth and speed and that "overall, ''Enduro'' is exhausting but exhilarating."{{sfn|Hochberg|Schmittberger|1983}} Reviewing the ZX Spectrum version, a reviewer in ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' noted the graphics were not overly detailed, but had a better than average 3D effect. They concluded that ''Enduro'' was one of Activision's better games but on the Spectrum it was better than ''Speed Duel'' but not as strong as ''[[Full Throttle (1984 video game)|Full Throttle]]''.{{sfn|Crash|1984|ref=Crash}}

''Enduro'' received the award for "1984 Best Sports Videogame" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]] where the judges praised it for "featur[ing] some of the best graphics presented by a 2600 and boast[ing] an intriguing concept".{{sfn|Kunkel|Katz|1984|p=42}}  ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reviewed the game in 1989, giving it a 77% score.<ref name="CVG">{{cite journal |title=Complete Games Guide |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref> 

From retrospective reviews, Brett Weiss in his book ''Classic Home Video Games 1972-1984'' complimented the game, describing it as remarkable racing game, noting it's variety, suspense and graphic sophistication. Weiss found it superior games like ''[[Pole Position]]'' noting it was more involved and atmospheric, noting the day to night scenes in the game.{{sfn|Weiss|2007|p=57}} In their list of the top 25 Atari 2600 games, Stuart Hunt and Darran Jones listed ''Enduro'' in at their 21st spot in ''Retro Gamer''. The writers found the graphics and average, but that it was the entertaining gameplay that made Activision racer so special. and that the game is "arguably the 2600's best racer."{{sfn|Jones|Hunt|p=21}}

==Legacy==
In 1985 Activision released ''[[The Great American Cross-Country Road Race]]'', a home computer game that is based on the design of ''Enduro'', but with enhanced visuals, audio, and some additional gameplay elements.<ref>{{citation |last=DeMeo |first=Alex |title=Great American Cross-Country Road Race (GAME10.HLP) |type=Online help |year=1995 |work=Activision's Commodore 64 15 Pack |publisher=[[Activision]] |at=Game History |quote=The code and drivers [parts of the program for the game] from Enduro that displayed the road and fed cars to pass were used as the engine for Great American Road Race.  But when you moved to more powerful systems like the Atari 400 or 800, or the Commodore 64, more was expected of the game, so the whole design, graphics, sound, and so on, were all redone for the new platforms. We added elements too, like the dashboard and the police.}}</ref>
