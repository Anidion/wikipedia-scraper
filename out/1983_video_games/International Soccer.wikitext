==Gameplay==
''International Soccer'' can be played by two players or one player against an [[AI]] opponent. Each team can select one of a number of colored shirts, and the AI opponent is graded into 9 different difficulty levels. The game itself is a relatively simple game of [[Association football|soccer]]; there is no [[Offside (association football)|offside rule]] and no possibility to [[Foul (sports)|foul]] opponents.

Each game is divided into two 200-second halves. There are no overtimes or shootouts. There are also six colors a person can choose from for play: red, yellow, blue, grey, white, and orange. The winning team is presented a gold trophy after the game by a dark-haired woman.

The game includes a gray-scale mode that is more suited for black-and-white television sets.

==Reception==
''International Soccer'' was well received, gaining a Certificate of Merit in the category of "1984 Best Computer Sports Game" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= February 1984 |title= Arcade Alley: The 1984 Arcade Awards, Part II |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 11|pages= 28–29|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|28}} ''InfoWorld'' described ''International Soccer'' as Commodore's best competitor to the very successful [[Atarisoft]] games. The magazine wrote that the "{{sic|hide=y|minim|asterpiece}}" was "surprisingly good, considering it's published by Commodore" (because "the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity"), praising gameplay and especially animation.<ref name="mace19840409">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jC4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50 | title=Atarisoft vs. Commodore | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-04-09 | accessdate=4 February 2015 | author=Mace, Scott | pages=50}}</ref> ''[[Ahoy!]]'' wrote that ''International Soccer'' "is a pure action game, but, oh, what action!", praising the graphics and game-play.<ref name="ahoy198601">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_25_1986-01_Ion_International_US#page/n45/mode/2up | title=Calling Computer Coaches / Team Sports Simulations for the Commodore 64 | work=Ahoy! | date=January 1986 | accessdate=2 July 2014 | author1=Kunkel, Bill | author2=Katz, Arnie | pages=47–50}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''International Soccer'' was the inspiration for ''[[Match Day (video game)|Match Day]]'' on the [[ZX Spectrum]].<ref name='ritmancrash33'>{{cite magazine |title=From Namtir Raiders, To A Bit Of Bovver With Bears Then On To Batman...

Andrew Spencer followed up ''International Soccer'' with ''International Basketball'' which was based on the same code.<ref name='rgmakingof' /> It reached number 2 in the UK Commodore 64 charts in April 1985<ref name='hcwcharts'>{{cite magazine |title=Commodore Top Ten|magazine=Home Computing Weekly|issue=112|publisher=Argus Specialist Publications|date=14 May 1985|page=5|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2678&page=41|access-date=28 September 2022}}</ref> but was not released in the US.<ref name='rgmakingof' /> Spencer would later work with [[Epyx]], adapting his [[Sprite_(computer_graphics)|sprite]] coding technique for use on their 1987 game ''[[Street Sports Basketball]]''.<ref name='rgmakingof' />
