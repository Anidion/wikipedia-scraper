'''''Snooker''''' (sometimes referred to as '''''Snooker '83''''') is a [[sports video game]] published by Visions Software Factory in 1983. The game simulates the cue sport of [[snooker]]. It was released for the [[Acorn Electron]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]], [[VIC-20]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

==Summary==
This video game simulates the game of [[snooker]] on the major home computers of that era. The players take turns to hit a white cue ball against the reds or colours following the rules of snooker.  The strength of the shot and the spin can be selected using the space bar and cursor keys respectively.

The limited colour selections of the home computers of the time (often limited to 8 colours) along with the [[random-access memory|memory]] sizes (the VIC-20 version ran in less than 6K of [[Random-access memory|RAM]]) meant the user experience was limited compared to more modern implementations.

There were also other games simply titled "Snooker" for the ZX Spectrum, including one release by [[Microbyte]] and [[Artic Computing Ltd]] also in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/snooker|title=Snooker for ZX Spectrum 1983|website=[[MobyGames]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124195648/http://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/snooker|archivedate=2018-01-24}}</ref> The games were followed in 1984 by ''[[Steve Davis Snooker]]'' and ''[[Steve Davis World Snooker]]'' in 1985.
