==Gameplay==

The invading aliens take the form of wing-flapping Birdmen. ''Swoop'' differs from other ''Galaxian'' clones in that the Birdmen will lay explosive eggs if they successfully reach the bottom of the screen. If the eggs are touched by the player's laser base then a life is lost, so they effectively confine the movement of the laser base until they disappear after some pre-set time.

There are a total of eight levels (called "phases" in the cassette inlay instructions), each successively more difficult than the last. The most difficult level has a total of two Birdmen and eight missiles raining down on the player simultaneously.
