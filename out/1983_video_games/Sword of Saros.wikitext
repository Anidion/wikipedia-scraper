==Gameplay==
The objective is to explore the evil wizard's maze-like dungeon to find the pieces of the Sword of Saros. The wizard sends bats to find the player; when successful, the wizard teleports to the player's location and sends waves of skeletons to attack. Helpful magical items can be found in the world.
