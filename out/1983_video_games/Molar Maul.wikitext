==Gameplay==

The playing area consists of a stylised open mouth, with teeth above and below, and a tube of [[toothpaste]] in the middle of the screen.  The player controls a small [[toothbrush]], which is loaded with toothpaste from the tube.

A number of small creatures, collectively known as "DK" (a [[pun]] on "[[tooth decay|decay]]"), fly around the mouth and attack teeth at random.  Teeth are initially white, but change to progressively darker colours as they are attacked.  If a tooth turns black it is lost.  DKs are killed by contact with a loaded toothbrush, which also lightens non-black teeth.

As the game progresses, sweets appear and introduce ever-larger numbers of DK.  The game ends when all the teeth are destroyed.
