Stefan Jones reviewed ''PC Arcade'' in ''[[Space Gamer]]'' No. 66.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Jones |first=Stefan |date=Novâ€“Dec 1983 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=66|pages=38}}</ref> Jones commented that "I highly recommend ''PC Arcade'' to PC users who want to try arcade games but don't care about superb graphics or absolute fidelity to the classics these games emulate. Hard-core arcadists (arcadites? Arcaders?) may be disappointed, though."<ref name="SG"/>

FriendlySoft claimed, in a 1983 ''[[PC Magazine]]'' ad, that "the first two PC ARCADE production runs sold out before they shipped."<ref name=pcmag/>
