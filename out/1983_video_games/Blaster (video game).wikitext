'''''Blaster''''' is a first-person [[rail shooter]] released as an [[ arcade video game]] by [[Williams Electronics]] in 1983. It was developed by [[Eugene Jarvis]] and [[Larry DeMar]]. A vague sequel to ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', the game is a [[shoot 'em up]] set in [[outer space]]. The goal is to destroy enemies, avoid obstacles, and rescue astronauts in twenty levels, to reach paradise.

The game uses large, scaled [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] to give the impression of attackers and asteroids approaching the player's ship. It was originally written for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]]–something not made public until 2004. Neither the Atari 8-bit nor the arcade machine has bitmap scaling hardware; the Atari CPU has a higher clock rate.{{clarification needed | date=July 2023}}

Cabinet art was done by Tom Schmelzer and Larry Day of Advertising Posters in Chicago.

''Blaster'' was sold in both [[Duramold]] and, much less commonly, traditional wooden cabinets.

==Plot==
According to the opening demo: {{quote|It is the year 2085. The Robotrons have destroyed the human race. You escape in a stolen space shuttle. Your destination: Paradise. A remote outpost 20 million light years away. Does paradise exist? Can civilization be started again? These questions will be answered at the end of your journey. But first, you must BLAST... OR BE BLASTED!}}

This implies that the game takes place after the events of ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', but aside from a few oversized G.R.U.N.T. robots in the first stage, none of the ''Robotron'' characters make an appearance in ''Blaster''.

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}
The game is controlled  with an optical [[joystick]] and two buttons: fire and thrust. The ship's weapon fires from a linear bank of four pyramid-shaped shots.{{clarify | date=July 2023}} Shots do not emanate toward the exact center of the screen; the first shot in the series will be furthest left, while the fourth will be furthest right. The Blastership is given three lives, and extra lives are awarded every 100,000 points. The player has a [[health (gaming)|life bar]], in likeness to similar games such as ''[[Star Fox (1993 video game)|Star Fox]]'', but in this implementation, the life bar represents three hit points, and not a continuum of health points. When the ship gets hit a second time the text "ENERGY CRITICAL" will be flashed on-screen. Almost everything in the game can be destroyed, from the asteroids to enemy shots. In fact, the latter is a critical component of surviving for an extended period of time.

Marooned [[astronaut]]s can be rescued by interception. They are initially worth 1,000 points, which is incremented by 200 points for each subsequent rescue during the same life, for a maximum value of 2,000 points per rescue. Any situation where enemies appear in groups offers additional bonuses for destroying all enemies in the group. In some levels, such as the Saucerland waves, there are conditions which necessitate a certain order for the ships to be destroyed. In most of the levels, a large blue 'E' decorated with arcs of lightning can be found. Shooting these 'E's will completely fill the shields, while colliding with them will cause the player to warp to the next wave. Before warping, every object in the level will turn into 'E's and the ship will speed against a backdrop of a field of E with Energizers.{{clarify | date=July 2023}}

==Development==
''Blaster'' was originally programmed by [[Vid Kidz]] for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and the [[Atari 5200]] console, and then converted to the arcade version.<ref name="retro"/> It was the third and last release by Vid Kidz.<ref name="retro"/>  The Atari versions were eventually cancelled during the corporate shuffling that occurred after the [[video game crash of 1983]], although they were finally found and released to the public in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/8bit/software/blaster/blaster.htm |title=Blaster |last=Reichert |first=Matt |year=2004 |work=AtariProtos.com |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref>

The [[Motorola 6809]] of the arcade machine runs at only 1 MHz, "and man did it hurt", according to Jarvis.<ref name="mat">{{cite book |title=Midway Arcade Treasures |date=2003 |publisher=Midway Games}}</ref>

Only three cockpit (sit-down) machines were ever produced. One is on display in [[Palo Alto, California]] in the home of Jarvis's father and the second was converted into a machine for ''Devastator'', a prototype game that was never released. According to Jarvis, there have been unconfirmed sightings of the third.<ref name=mat/>

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2018}}
Gene Lewin of ''[[Play Meter]]'' magazine reviewed the arcade game in 1983, scoring it 3 out of 10 as a dedicated [[arcade cabinet]], but would raise it to 8 out of 10 if released as a conversion kit. The review called it a space shoot-em-up with "good" graphics and sound effects.<ref name="PM">{{cite magazine |last1=Lewin |first1=Gene |title=Gene's Judgements: Critiquing AMOA Show Conversions, Dedicated Games |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=January 15, 1984 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=60–3 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-10-number-2-january-15th-1984/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%2010%2C%20Number%202%20-%20January%2015th%201984/page/60/mode/2up}}</ref>
