[[Image:KillerKongScr1.gif|thumb|200px|Screenshot]]

[[Crash (magazine)|''Crash'']] magazine called ''Killer Kong'' "a very fine version with excellent graphics and plenty of screen variation."<ref>{{citation |title=CRASH 3 - Platform Games |magazine=Crash |publication-date=April 1984 |issue=3 |url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/03/lguide07.htm}}</ref>

In 2011, retrogaming magazine ''ZX Spectrum Gamer'' wrote, "''Killer Kong'' might actually be pretty good if it didn't play like a magazine [[type-in program|type-in]]. The movement is really jerky–character square movement instead of pixel precision, and the barrels tend to flicker enough to make things really tricky".<ref name=sg/>
