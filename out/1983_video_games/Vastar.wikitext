'''Vastar''' is a horizontally scrolling shooter released in arcades in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/arcade/569120-vastar|title = Vastar for Arcade Games - GameFAQs}}</ref> It was released by [[Toaplan|Orca]]. The company went bankrupt and could not sell the game under their own brand, so they created the alias Sesame Japan Corporation to release this game.

== Plot ==
[[image:vastar.png|thumb|left|upright=2]]

In the year 2956 [[AD]], a fighting [[robot]] named ''Vastar'' was developed by scientists in order to protect [[Earth]] from the ''Galaxy Empire''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10299|title = Vastar - Videogame by Sesame Japan}}</ref>

The game's is set in a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[Earth]]. In some points of the game, ruins of the [[Statue of Liberty]], [[Mount Rushmore]] and the [[Moai]] (stone heads from [[Easter Island]]) can be seen.

== Gameplay ==
The player controls Vastar, a fighting flying robot that can shoot enemies with laser beams. Vastar is destroyed by enemy contact or strike but it is provided with a shield that must be activated to prevent attacks. When the shield's energy runs out, Vastar turns itself in an airship that still can shoot laser beams but it's defenseless against strikes. As the player reaches Vastar's base (as well if the player loses a life and restarts with another one), the shield's power is fully charged again and Vastar returns to its default form.
