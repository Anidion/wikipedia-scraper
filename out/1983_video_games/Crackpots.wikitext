'''''Crackpots''''' is an [[Atari 2600]] game designed by Dan Kitchen and published by [[Activision]] in 1983. It was Kitchen's first game for Activision.

In ''Crackpots'', the player controls Potsy, a [[gardener]]. Potsy's [[Brooklyn]] building is being overrun by bugs trying to climb inside six windows.<ref name=manual/> The player moves Potsy back and forth along the roof to drop pots on the bugs before they can get close enough to enter the windows.

==Gameplay==
Each level consists of four waves of twelve bugs each;<ref name=manual/> defeat all four waves and the player will move on to a more difficult and faster-paced level. Play then resumes until the building crumbles to the ground. If six or more bugs enter through the open windows, part of the building will be eaten away, and you will have to replay the level. The patterns vary for different colored bugs. Black bugs will move straight up the building, blue bugs wiggle from left to right, red bugs move diagonally, and green bugs zig-zag between windows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=111|title=AtariAge - Atari 2600 - Crackpots (Activision)|website=www.atariage.com|access-date=2016-09-01|archive-date=2016-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917160021/https://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=111|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Development==
''Crackpots'' was developed by [[Dan Kitchen]]. Prior to joining [[Activision]], he worked on developing handheld games such as ''Wildfire'' that was released in the United Kingdom by [[Palitoy]]. Along with his brother [[Garry Kitchen]], Dan was eager to get involved with console game development and attended the Consumer Electronic Show in January 1982. The brothers were approached by both [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] and Activision and opted to work for the latter. Dan was among the five new coders who started at Activision's new East coast office to develop their own titles.{{sfn|Drury|2020|p=34}}

Dan came up for the idea while having lunch with his brother [[Garry Kitchen]] and [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]] in [[Glen Rock, New Jersey]]. Dan saw a construction site across the street and witnessed a pack of plants fromm a scaffolding and thought "That would be fun to do..."{{sfn|Drury|2020|p=34}} It was his first game for the Atari 2600. It ogrammed on an [[Apple II]] connected to a [[PDP-11]] development system.{{sfn|Drury|2020|p=34}} Dan initially wanted the insects to be described as arachnids, but the marketing team at Activision changed their names to sewer bugs.{{sfn|Drury|2020|p=34}} Dan said that a motto at Activision at the time was "no flickering", leading him to spend weeks on fixing even the slightest graphical errors in his games.{{sfn|Drury|2020|p=35}}

==Release==
The video game was released during the [[video game crash of 1983]]. Dan recalled that the ''Crackpots'' "hit the shelves for $30 when games were selling for $2 so I don't think it had a chance."{{sfn|Drury|2020|p=35}} Dan planned to follow-up the game with a sequel to his brother's game ''[[Keystone Kapers]]'', with the game being in a [[Western (genre)|Western]]-setting. In 2018, Dan found the only surviving copy of the unfinished game in a storage unit and planned to release it under the title ''Gold Rush''.{{sfn|Drury|2020|p=35}} 

==Reception==
A review in the November 1983 issue of ''Videogaming and Computer Gaming Illustrated'' stated, "I think Activision has finally  reached the point of saturation with the ''[[Kaboom! (video game)|Kaboom!]]'' theme of having to catch or toss objects," but still gave the game a letter grade of B.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Jim |title=Crackpots |journal=Videogaming and Computer Gaming Illustrated |date=November 1983 |page=12 |url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_and_Computer_Gaming_Illustrated_1983-11_Ion_International_US/page/n11?q=activision+crackpots}}</ref>

In a retrospective look, the Video Game Critic gave a letter grade of C: "It's a shame ''Crackpots'' only has one skill level because once you get the hang of it, the game tends to run long. Still, sharp graphics and thoughtful gameplay make this one worth a look."<ref>{{cite web |title=Crackpots |url=https://videogamecritic.com/2600cc.htm |website=The Video Game Critic}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Crackpots'' was included in the compilation packages ''Activision Classics'' (1998) for the [[PlayStation]] and the ''[[Activision Anthology]]'' (2002) for the [[PlayStation 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/1998/09/30/activision-classics|work=[[IGN]]|title=Activision Classics|date=September 29, 1998|accessdate=August 19, 2013|author=Harris, Craig}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2002/11/21/activision-anthology-2|work=[[IGN]]|title=Activision Anthology|date=November 21, 2002|accessdate=August 19, 2013|author=Dunham, Jeremy}}</ref>
