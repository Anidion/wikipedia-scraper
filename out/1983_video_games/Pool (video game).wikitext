'''''Pool''''' is a 1983 [[video game]] written by Mike Lamb and published by [[CDS Micro Systems]] for the 16K [[ZX Spectrum]]. It was re-released later in 1983 on CDS's Blue Ribbon label, and re-released again in 1986 on their "2.99 Classic" label.

==Gameplay==
In ''Pool'', the table begins with six balls (three red and three blue), and each player gets three shots with the white ball. The goal is to pot all six balls. The cue ball is aimed by moving a target around the edge of the table and setting the strength of the shot. The number of shots remaining decreases for each shot made unless a ball is potted, upon which it is restored to three. Blue balls are worth 20 points, and red balls 10 points.

==Reception==
In [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] magazine's review, the reviewers noted that balls moved "accurately and smoothly" with "convincing" rebounds. It was considered to be the best Spectrum version of arcade pool and awarded an overall score of 77%.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]|page=40|issue=6|publisher=Newsfield|date=July 1984|title=Reviews: Pool}}</ref> [[Your Sinclair]] rated ''Pool'' 6 out of 10, finding it was "not the most imaginative of realisations" but "a pleasure to find a game where Euclid is of more use than blood-lust and whizzo reflexes".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|page=October 84|issue=10|publisher=Sportscene Specialist Press|date=1986|title=Screen Shots: Pool}}</ref>
