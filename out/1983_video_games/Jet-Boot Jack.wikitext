'''''Jet-Boot Jack''''' (also called '''''The Music Machine starring Jet-Boot Jack''''') is a [[platform game]] written by Jon Williams for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published by [[English Software]] in 1983.<ref name=giantlist/> It was ported to the [[Acorn Electron]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[Commodore 64]]. A C64-only sequel, ''Legend of the Knucker-Hole'', was released in 1984.

==Plot==
The player controls Jack, a “space-age jogger,” in a record production plant who must build up the ultimate music collection.

==Gameplay==

The production plant is set out as a series of platforms connected by [[elevator|lifts]]. To complete each level, the player must collect all the musical notes while avoiding monsters, moving lifts and [[stalactite]]s. Jack can be moved left or right using his jet boots to hover or by ducking and sliding under fatal stalactites or monsters. By hovering, Jack can clear lift shafts but if he stops over the shaft, it is fatal. Jack's jet energy runs down, particularly if he stands still for a while, and must be replenished by collecting [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] from overhanging pods. Two types of monsters can be killed for bonus points by jumping on the platform above them. A third type of monster is invincible. Bonus points are awarded when a screen is completed based on the vinyl refills unused.

There are ten screens which then repeat at a higher difficulty level e.g. with more monsters and fewer refills per vinyl pod.

==Ports==
The game was one of English's first games to be converted to other platforms beginning with the [[Commodore 64]], also in 1983, and the [[Acorn Electron]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[BBC Micro]] in 1984. The Amstrad version was also later published by [[Amsoft]] (1985). In the US, the game was released by [[Datamost]] with the subtitle "Adventures in the Music Machine" on the cover and billed as ''The Music Machine starring Jet-Boot Jack'' on the title screen.<ref name="Atari Mania US">[http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-jet-boot-jack_13402.html Jet-Boot Jack (US version)] at Atari Mania</ref>

==Reception==
Atari magazine ''[[Page 6]]'' gave a positive review concluding "Although on a now familiar theme the unique story line and good programming makes ''Jet Boot Jack'' well worth getting.
