'''''Hunchback''''' (shown as '''''Hunch Back''''' on the title screen) is a [[video game]] developed by Century Electronics and published in arcades in 1983. The game is loosely based on the 1831 [[Victor Hugo]] novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' and the player controls [[Quasimodo]]. Set on top of a castle wall, the player must guide the Hunchback from left to right while avoiding obstacles on a series of non-scrolling screens. The goal of each screen is to ring the church bell at the far right.

==Gameplay==

Obstacles include pits which must be swung over on a long rope, [[Defensive wall|ramparts]] which must be jumped (some of which contain knights with spears) and flying fireballs and arrows (to be ducked or jumped). To impose a time limit on each screen a knight climbs the wall, costing the player a life should he reach the top. Eventually, after completing a number of screens, the player must rescue [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]]. If this final screen is completed, the game begins again at a faster speed.

==Development==
The main character was originally [[Robin Hood]] with the game set in [[Sherwood Forest]] but the setting was changed to [[Nottingham Castle]] as the theme was deemed too similar to the games main inspiration, ''[[Pitfall!]]''. The addition of the bell as a reward at the end of each screen led to the main character becoming the Hunchback of Notre Dame instead. A deadline to present the game at an industry show meant there was no time to rework the graphics, so the main character remained in a [[Lincoln green]] costume.<ref name='rg164hunchback'>{{cite magazine |title=The Making of Hunchback|magazine=Retro Gamer|issue=164|publisher=Future Publishing|date=26 January 2017|pages=58â€“61}}</ref>

==Ports==
An unauthorised version of the game was published by [[Superior Software]] for the BBC Micro in 1983, reaching the number one position in the BBC charts.<ref name='pcw22sep83charts'>{{cite magazine |title=Charts|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=38|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=22 September 1983|page=47|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2773&page=47|access-date=17 April 2023}}</ref> Century Electronics took out an injunction to prevent the game from being sold<ref name='pcw01sep83'>{{cite magazine |title=For whom the bell tolls|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=35|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=1 September 1983|page=1|url=https://archive.org/details/popular-computing-weekly-1983-09-01/mode/2up|access-date=17 April 2023}}</ref> before reaching a licensing agreement with the publisher.<ref name='pcw02feb84'>{{cite magazine |title=Century collapses|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=5|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=2 February 1984|page=5|url=https://archive.org/details/popular-computing-weekly-1984-02-02/page/n3|access-date=17 April 2023}}</ref><ref name='rg164hunchback' />

==Legacy==
The home ports inspired two sequels: ''Hunchback II: Quasimodo's Revenge'' and ''Hunchback: The Adventure'', which were released by Ocean for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.

Clones released for 8-bit computers are ''Quasimodo'' (1983) from [[Synapse Software]] for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and ''The Great Wall'' (1986) from [[Artic Computing]] for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro.
