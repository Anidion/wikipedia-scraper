'''''Winged Warlords''''' is a [[ZX Spectrum]] [[Computer and video game|game]] which was published by [[CDS Microsystems]] in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]].<ref>{{WoS game|id=0005692}}</ref> It is a clone of ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]''
<ref name="su">{{cite journal|journal=Sinclair User|date=April 1984|url=http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/025/softwre.htm|issue=25|title=Spectrum Software Scene}}</ref> in terms of level design and gameplay. The graphics are different, with the ostrich mounts being replaced with [[pegasus|winged horses]].

It was authored by Mike Lamb, who went on to write many Spectrum conversions of arcade games such as ''[[Arkanoid]]'' and ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]''

==Gameplay==
Presented with a 2D side-view arena with several platforms, the player maneuvers a pegasus-mounted warlord. Left and right movement is inertia-heavy, as is 'flap' movement against gravity. In one difference with the arcade version of ''Joust'', the flap key may be held down rather than tapped.

Collision with a computer-controlled enemy results in one warlord being dismounted, depending on who had the altitudinal advantage. If the player is dismounted, he loses one of four lives. If the enemy is dismounted, the figure tumbles downwards as his mount flies away. This dismounted warlord may be attacked again for bonus points. If left unattended, the warlord eventually calls a new mount and re-enters the battle (coloured magenta instead of cyan.) Occasionally the ''Winged Warlord'' equivalent of ''Joust's'' pterodactyl will appear; the Evil Bird of War (which appears to be some kind of large duck.) Contact with this is lethal for the player; it must be avoided as it makes its way across the screen.

==Reception==
''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' magazine reviewed ''Winged Warlords'' in its third issue, awarding it 79%, while ''[[Sinclair User]]'' gave it 6/10;<ref name="su"/> generally receiving better critical success than other Spectrum ''Joust'' clones such as [[Softek Software|Softek's]] ''[[Ostron]]''.
