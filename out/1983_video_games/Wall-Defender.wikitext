==Gameplay==
''Wall-Defender'' is a single-player game in which the player defends a fortress comprising a series of walls against [[kamikaze]] attacks by aliens.<ref name="Retro Gamer">{{cite web |title=Retro Video Gamer Review |url=http://www.retrovideogamer.co.uk/forum/?page=atari2600vwxyz |website=Retro Video Gamer |accessdate=10 August 2019}}</ref> The player controls a sprite that moves along the walls firing missiles at attackers. The outer wall may take ten attacks from ordinary attackers, though there are "super" attackers that can destroy a wall with a single hit. The colours of the walls change as they reduce in strength to indicate to the player that they are weakening, and after the seventh hit from an ordinary attacker they will begin to flash. If a wave of attackers is destroyed with none of them striking the player is given an extra wall. When a wall is about to fall the player must abandon it for an inner wall, otherwise they are destroyed and the game is over.<ref name="Score" />

==Reception==
In their 1983 review the UK magazine ''TV Gamer'' criticised the graphics but praised the novel concept of the game and described it as "an absorbing game which requires plenty of dexterity."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wall-Defender |journal=TV Gamer |date=Autumn 1983 |page=40 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/magazines/tv_gamer/tv_gamer_autumn83.pdf |accessdate=10 August 2019}}</ref> The Australian magazine ''Score'' reviewed the game positively in their 1983 review, summing it up by saying that "for a single-theme game, ''Wall-Defender'' delivers what it promises".<ref name="Score">{{cite news |title=Against The Wall |url=https://archive.org/details/Score_201506/page/n35/mode/2up?q=%22Wall-Defender%22 |access-date=25 February 2021 |work=Score |issue=1 |date=1983 |page=34}}</ref> ''Computer and Video Games Magazine'' described the game as the most original of Bomb's releases.<ref name="Shoot those little aliens">{{cite news |title=Shoot those little aliens |url=https://archive.org/details/computer-video-games-magazine-020/page/n135/mode/2up?q=%22Wall+Defender%22 |access-date=26 February 2021 |work=Computer and Video Games Magazine |issue=20 |date=June 1983 |page=Supplement 4}}</ref>
