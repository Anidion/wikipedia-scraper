'''''Time Bandit''''' is a  [[Maze game|maze]] [[shoot 'em up]] written for the [[TRS-80]] Model I by Bill Dunlevy and Harry Lafnear and published by MichTron in 1983.<ref name=coco>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcurtisboyle.com/nitros9/timebandit.html|title=Time Bandit|website=Tandy (TRS-80) Color Computer Games|last1=Boyle|first1=L. Curtis}}</ref> It was ported to the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] and [[Dragon 32]], but enjoyed its greatest popularity several years later as an early release for the [[Atari ST]]. It was also released for the pseudo-PC-compatible [[MBC-550|Sanyo MBC-55x]] with 8-color display. [[Amiga]] and [[MS-DOS]] versions were ported by Timothy Purves.

==Gameplay==
In each overhead-view level, the player must gather keys to open locks which allow access to the exit. Between levels,  the player chooses the next level from one of 16 different "Timegates", each leading to a different world, and each of which must be completed sixteen times, each time being progressively more difficult than the last. The worlds vary in character and difficulty. Some worlds incorporate elements of [[text adventure game]]s, and most contain gameplay references to other popular games of the time, such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]''. In addition to the primary objective of exiting each level, optional [[side quest]]s become available in the later stages of some worlds, usually awarding the player with one of several "artifacts" upon completion.

The game also features a "Duel Mode" for two players.<ref name="Antic5.6">{{cite journal

==Development==
According to Harry Lafnear, ''Time Bandit'' was based on [[Konami]]'s 1982 arcade game ''[[Tutankham]]'' and was originally called ''Pharaoh''.<ref name="legend">{{cite web |title=Harry Lafnear Interview |url=https://www.atarilegend.com/interviews/interviews_detail.php?selected_interview_id=4 |website=Atari Legend |date=September 5, 2003}}</ref> The Atari ST and Amiga versions have visual similarities to ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'',<ref name=coco/> but ''Gauntlet'' was released in late 1985 after development of ''Time Bandit'' was complete.<ref name=legend/> According to Lafnear, he found out about ''Gauntlet'' from friends who saw it at an arcade and called it "a ''Time Bandit'' clone". However, he believes neither game copied each other, but that the similarities stem from earlier "[[Maze game|maze]] [[shoot 'em ups]]" such as ''[[Tutankham]]''.<ref name="legend"/>

==Reception==
Lafnear estimates that 75,000 copies were sold, mostly for the [[Atari ST]].<ref name=legend/>

[[Jerry Pournelle]] of ''[[BYTE]]'' named ''Time Bandit'' his game of the month for September 1986, stating that the ST version "is the best arcade-type computer game I have ever seen".<ref name="pournelle198609">{{Cite magazine |last=Pournelle |first=Jerry |date=September 1986 |title=A Busy Day |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-09/1986_09_BYTE_11-09_The_68000_Family#page/n331/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |page=321}}</ref> The game was well received by reviewers in ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'',<ref name="Antic5.6"/> ''[[Compute!|COMPUTE!]]'',<ref name="bateman198610">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-10-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_077_1986_Oct#page/n19/mode/2up | title=A Great Year For Games | work=Compute! | date=October 1986 | accessdate=9 November 2013 | author=Bateman, Selby | pages=18}}</ref> and ''[[BYTE]]''<ref name="webster198612">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-12/1986_12_BYTE_11-13_Graphics_Algorithms#page/n319/mode/2up | title=Season's Greetings | work=BYTE | date=December 1986 | accessdate=9 May 2015 | author=Webster, Bruce | pages=305}}</ref> for its gameplay and graphics, though reviews also noted that the game includes no music and has minimal sound effects.
