'''''The Witness''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] video game published by [[Infocom]] in 1983. Like Infocom's earlier title ''[[Deadline (1982 video game)|Deadline]]'', it is a [[murder mystery]]. ''The Witness'' was written in the ZIL language for the [[Z-machine]], which allowed it to be released simultaneously on many systems. It is Infocom's seventh game.

==Plot==
[[File:The Witness (1983 video game) screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of the game]]

The game takes place in Cabeza Plana, a quiet and [[fictional town|fictional]] (the name is Spanish for "Flathead", from [[Zork]] mythology) suburb of [[Los Angeles, California]] in February 1938. 

Freeman Linder, a local millionaire, has begged the police for protection from a man named Stiles. The player's character is a detective assigned one evening to check out the wealthy man's claims: is Linder seriously in danger or just another rich eccentric? Before the player can decide, a window explodes and Linder collapses, dead. 

The case of possible harassment has just become a murder, with the player as the only witness. With the help of Sgt. Duffy (last seen in ''Deadline''), the player has until sunrise to solve the mystery. Motive, method, and opportunity must all be established to secure a solid arrest and the optimal ending. There are two ways for the player to die.<ref name="nzt1984spring">{{Cite journal |date=Spring 1984 |title=Infocom Scoreboard |url=http://infodoc.plover.net/nzt/NZT3.2.pdf |journal=The New Zork Times |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=3}}</ref>

==Development==
Enjoying playing ''[[Deadline (1982 video game)|Deadline]]'' more than ''[[Zork]]'', Stu Galley decided to write another mystery game as its counterpart; while ''Deadline'' is set in the eastern United States on a summer day, ''Witness'' is set in the West Coast at night. For authenticity, he obtained a 1930s [[Sears catalog]] and researched contemporary slang; the radio plays the programs that aired on the day the game occurs in.<ref name="dyer19840506">{{Cite news |url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/globe84.html |title=Masters of the Game |last=Dyer |first=Richard |date=1984-05-06 |newspaper=The Boston Globe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970607204921/http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/globe84.html |archive-date=1997-06-07}}</ref>

==Release==
Included in each package of ''The Witness'' were the following supplementary items:

*Virginia Linder's suicide note addressed to her daughter Monica
*A [[telegram]] from Freeman Linder pleading for protection from Stiles
*A [[matchbook]] from The Brass Lantern Chinese restaurant
*A February 1938 issue of the fictional magazine ''National Detective Gazette''
*Two pages of a real issue of the [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] newspaper ''[[Santa Ana Register|The Register]]'', with two articles added about Virginia and Freeman Linder

==Reception==
''[[Creative Computing]]'' wrote "Infocom has come up with another fine game with Witness ... If you have ever longed to work with [[Philip Marlowe]], [[Miss Marple]], or [[Lord Peter Wimsey]], Witness is the next best thing."<ref name="cc198312">{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n12/120_Infocom_does_it_again_.php | title=Infocom does it again ... and again | work=Creative Computing | date=December 1983 | accessdate=February 26, 2013 | author=Arrants, Steve | pages=153}}</ref> [[Dan Gutman]] in ''[[Compute!]]'' stated that "''The Witness'' is the latest in Infocom's masterful series in all-text adventures, and it may be their best one yet". He praised the game's feelies and period-accurate prose style, and said that the addition of Duffy avoided ''Deadline''{{'}}s tendency to "bog down". Gutman cautioned, however, that only those who enjoyed intricate puzzles would like ''The Witness''.<ref name="gutman198312">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1983-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_043_1983_Dec#page/n181/mode/2up | title=The Witness | work=Compute! | date=December 1983 | accessdate=30 October 2013 | author=Gutman, Dan | authorlink=Dan Gutman | pages=182, 184}}</ref> ''[[BYTE]]'' agreed on the game's difficulty, and stated that author Stu Galley "apparently read enough of the [hard-boiled mystery] genre to emulate the style without mocking it", with "quick but thorough and evocative" descriptions. The magazine praised the feelies, and concluded that "Galley and the Infocom staff have succeeded in designing what [[Sherlock Holmes]] would call a 'three-pipe problem.'"<ref name="barker198403">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-03/1984_03_BYTE_09-03_Simulation#page/n301/mode/2up | title=The Witness | work=BYTE | date=March 1984 | accessdate=17 January 2015 | author=Barker, Dennis | pages=301}}</ref> ''[[PC Magazine]]'' gave the game 11.0 points out of 12. It stated that the quality of the text parser and intricate plot balanced the "scant" 28 locations in the game.<ref name="wiswell19850122">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9C7NnwCf1gC&pg=PA245 | title=The Plot Thickens | work=PC Magazine | date=1985-01-22 | accessdate=28 October 2013 | author=Wiswell, Phil | pages=245}}</ref>

''The Witness'' received the award for "1984 Best Computer Adventure" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]] where judges warned those who thought [[text adventure]]s were "passe" that the game had "run away with the Arcade Award" just as Infocom's previous text adventure, ''[[Deadline (1982 video game)|Deadline]]'', had the previous year.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= February 1984 |title= Arcade Alley: The 1984 Arcade Awards, Part II |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 11|pages= 28â€“29|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|28}}
