{{Nihongo foot|'''''The Portopia Serial Murder Case'''''|ポートピア連続殺人事件|Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an 1983 [[adventure game]] designed by [[Yuji Horii]] and published by [[Enix]]. It was first released on the [[NEC PC-6001]] and has since been [[porting|ported]] to other [[personal computer]]s, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (Famicom), [[Mobile game|mobile phone services]] and most recently, [[Windows]] as [[Square Enix]] showing off their [[natural language processing]] technology.

In the game, the player must resolve a murder mystery by searching for clues, exploring different areas, interacting with characters, and solving [[Item (gaming)|item]]-based [[Puzzle game|puzzles]]. The game features [[First person (video games)|first-person]] graphics, [[nonlinear gameplay]], an [[open world]], conversations with [[non-player character]]s, [[Dialog tree|branching dialogue]] choices, suspect interrogations, nonlinear storytelling, and [[plot twist]]s. The Famicom version also features a command menu system, [[point-and-click]] interface, and 3D dungeon maze. Upon its release, ''The Portopia Serial Murder Case'' was well received in Japan. It became an influential title, helping to define the [[visual novel]] genre as well as inspiring Japanese game designers such as [[Hideo Kojima]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Eiji Aonuma]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Portopia PC-6001.gif|thumb|left|The crime scene in the original version of the game on the PC-6001.]]
''The Portopia Serial Murder Case'' follows a [[First person (video games)|first-person perspective]] and [[first-person narrative|narrative]]. The various events are described with still pictures and text messages. The player interacts with the game using a [[verb]]-[[noun]] [[parser]] which requires typing precise commands with the keyboard. Finding the exact words to type is considered part of the riddles that must be solved. While sound effects are present, the game lacks music and a [[Save game|save]] function.<ref name="itmedia">{{cite web | url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/games/articles/0509/06/news029.html | script-title=ja:「ポートピア連続殺人事件」の舞台を巡る | access-date=16 August 2007 | author=Gameman | date=6 September 2005 | website=ITmedia +D Games | publisher=ITmedia | page=1 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219032450/http://www.itmedia.co.jp/games/articles/0509/06/news029.html | archive-date=19 February 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fgamez.itmedia.co.jp%2Fgames%2Farticles%2F0509%2F06%2Fnews029.html Translation])</ref> It features a conversation system with [[Dialog tree|branching dialogue]] choices, where the story develops through entering commands and receiving answers to them from the player's sidekick or [[non-player character]]s.<ref name="Retro-85">{{cite web|title=Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken|work=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=85|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|date=February 2011|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kGAOBLrWIr4/TUgMtkSB28I/AAAAAAAACyk/oj3PBRY70HM/s1600/DSC01599.JPG|access-date=16 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203215020/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kGAOBLrWIr4/TUgMtkSB28I/AAAAAAAACyk/oj3PBRY70HM/s1600/DSC01599.JPG|archive-date=3 December 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}} (Reprinted at {{cite web|title=Retro Gamer 85|author=John Szczepaniak|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/02/retro-gamer-85.html|access-date=16 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412212446/http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/02/retro-gamer-85.html|archive-date=12 April 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}})</ref><ref name="interview"/><ref name="oxm"/>

With no keyboard, the Famicom version replaces the verb-noun parser with a menu list of fourteen set commands selectable with the [[gamepad]].<ref name="itmedia" /> This is similar to the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game ''Okhotsk ni Kiyu: Hokkaido Rensa Satsujin Jiken'' {{small|{{bracket|[[:ja:北海道連鎖殺人 オホーツクに消ゆ|ja]]}}}}, which was released in 1984,<ref name="enterbrain_okhotsk">{{cite web|title=北海道連鎖殺人 オホーツクに消ゆ|url=http://www.enterbrain.co.jp/digifami/products/ohotuku/|publisher=[[Enterbrain]]|access-date=20 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801112403/http://www.enterbrain.co.jp/digifami/products/ohotuku/|archive-date=1 August 2003}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ja&tl=en&u=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801112403/http://www.enterbrain.co.jp/digifami/products/ohotuku/ Translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512104352/https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ja&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20030801112403%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.enterbrain.co.jp%2Fdigifami%2Fproducts%2Fohotuku%2F |date=12 May 2017 }})</ref> in between the PC and Famicom releases of ''Portopia''.

==Setting and characters==
Although the story of the game is fictional, it is set in real Japanese cities; mainly [[Kobe]], in addition to a few sequences in [[Kyoto]] and [[Sumoto]].<ref name="itmedia" /> The president of a successful bank company, {{nihongo|Kouzou Yamakawa|山川耕造}}, is found dead by his secretary {{nihongo|Fumie Sawaki|さわき ふみえ}} inside a locked room in his mansion. Signs seem to indicate that Kouzou stabbed himself; however, the police sends a detective to investigate further.<ref name="official">{{cite web | url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/mobile/game/mysteries/portopia/ | script-title=ja:ポートピア連続殺人事件 | access-date=16 August 2007 | publisher=[[Square Enix]] | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809211738/http://www.square-enix.co.jp/mobile/game/mysteries/portopia/ | archive-date=9 August 2007 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The detective in charge of the case is an unnamed, unseen and [[silent protagonist]] who essentially embodies the player, and is simply referred to as {{nihongo|Boss|ボス}}.<ref name="official" /><ref name="tieryas"/><ref name="oxm"/> He works with an assistant named {{nihongo|Yasuhiko Mano|間野康彦}}, nicknamed {{nihongo|Yasu|ヤス}}, who is the one who actually speaks and executes most of the player's commands.<ref name="itmedia" /> Other characters include, among others, {{nihongo|Yukiko|ゆきこ}}, daughter of a man named {{nihongo|Hirata|ひらた}}; {{nihongo|Toshiyuki|としゆき}}, Kouzou's nephew and heir;<ref name="official" /> and {{nihongo|Okoi|おこい}}, a dancer.<ref name="official" /><ref name="Retro-85"/>

==Development and release==
The game was conceived by Yuji Horii around 1981, when he was 27 years old, shortly after he bought his first computer and learned to program with it by [[Mod (video gaming)|modifying]] other games.<ref name="RG-35">{{cite journal| journal = [[Retro Gamer]]| publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]| title = Before They Were Famous| issue = 35| page = 76|first = John| last = Szczepaniak}}</ref> During this time, he read a [[Video game journalism|PC magazine]] article about the rise of the [[Text-based game#Text adventure|text adventure]] [[Video game genres|computer game genre]] in the United States. Horii noticed the lack of such games in the Japanese market, and decided to create an adventure game of his own.<ref name="RG-35"/><ref name="interview">{{cite magazine|url=http://shmuplations.com/adventuregames/|title=The Possibilities of Adventure Games with Yuji Horii of Enix and Rika Suzuki of Riverhillsoft|magazine=[[Gemaga|Beep]]|year=1987|access-date=21 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531191948/http://shmuplations.com/adventuregames/|archive-date=31 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Horii also cited the [[manga]] authors [[Tetsuya Chiba]], [[Mitsuru Adachi]] and [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] as influences.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=59 Developers, 20 Questions: 1985 Interview Special|magazine=[[Gemaga|Beep]]|date=October 1985|url=http://shmuplations.com/20questions1985|access-date=22 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107003926/http://shmuplations.com/20questions1985/|archive-date=7 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The game was developed using the [[BASIC]] [[programming language]].<ref>{{cite web|title=BASIC's 50th anniversary draws near|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|date=28 April 2014|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnSzczepaniak/20140428/216345/BASICs_50th_anniversary_draws_near.php|access-date=12 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204101715/http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnSzczepaniak/20140428/216345/BASICs_50th_anniversary_draws_near.php|archive-date=4 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Horii wanted to expand on the adventure game genre with his own ideas.<ref name="interview"/> One such concept was to create "a program in which the story would develop through entering a command and by receiving an answer to it."<ref name="RG-35"/> His idea was for "a game that progresses through conversations between a human and a computer." He "started to get more ambitious," and thought he "could make the computer converse" if enough data is entered, attempting to create an [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] [[Natural language processing|language algorithm]]. However, he realized this was not possible on computers at the time, so he created "dialogue for the computer beforehand" where the player "could type in some words, and the computer would reply back with some reaction." Another concept was that, in contrast to other "very linear" stories in adventure games at the time, his idea was for branching, [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]] storytelling, where "the main scenario should only take up about 20% of the game's content, and the remaining 80% should be in response to the various actions of the player." However, due to PC memory limitations, he was only able to create several short branching scenarios, which he still found more interesting than one long linear scenario. He also conceived of a graphical format, with a picture on-screen representing what's happening and a command menu system to select an action, which later became the standard format for Japanese adventure games.<ref name="interview"/>

Following its 1983 release,<ref name="Retro-85"/> the game was ported to various Japanese personal computers.<ref name="sbg">{{cite web | url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/games/gsnews/0111/26/news01.html | title=事件だヤス! iモード「ポートピア」配信開始 | access-date=16 August 2007 | date=26 November 2001 | website=ITmedia +D Games | publisher=ITmedia | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050126040523/http://www.itmedia.co.jp/games/gsnews/0111/26/news01.html | archive-date=26 January 2005 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> A Famicom port was then released in 1985 and was the first adventure game to be released on that platform. The Famicom version was also the first collaboration between Yuji Horii and [[Koichi Nakamura]] of [[Chunsoft]], before ''[[Dragon Quest]]''.<ref name="k-tai watch">{{cite web | url=http://k-tai.watch.impress.co.jp/cda/article/news_toppage/22125.html | title=「ポートピア連続殺人事件」にグラフィックなどを一新したBREW版 | access-date=16 August 2007 | last=Ryozo | first=Ota | date=13 January 2005 | website=ケータイ | publisher=Impress Group | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018213855/http://k-tai.watch.impress.co.jp/cda/article/news_toppage/22125.html | archive-date=18 October 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Famicom version was programmed by Nakamura, who was 19 years old at the time.<ref name="Retro-85"/> This version of ''Portopia'' changed the interface, adopting the command menu system that Horii created for the 1984 adventure game ''Okhotsk ni Kiyu: Hokkaido Rensa Satsujin Jiken'' {{small|{{bracket|[[:ja:北海道連鎖殺人 オホーツクに消ゆ|ja]]}}}}. Due to frustration with text-based entry, admitting he was never able to get very far in adventure games because of it, Horii created a command menu system for ''Hokkaido'', which was later used in the Famicom version of ''Portopia''. Horii also noted that, for the Famicom versions of both ''Portopia'' and ''Hokkaido'', he wanted to make them appealing to a more mature audience, beyond the Famicom's typical younger audience.<ref name="Retro-85"/><ref name="interview"/> He was also playing ''[[Wizardry]]'' at the time, inspiring him to include a 3D dungeon maze in the Famicom version of ''Portopia''.<ref name="itmedia" /><ref name="RG-35"/> The game was never released in the Western world, largely due to its mature content, involving themes such as murder, suicide, fraud, bankruptcy, interrogation beatings, drug dealings, and a strip club.<ref name="Retro-85"/> The lack of a Western release prompted [[ROM hacking]] group DvD Translations to develop an unofficial translation of the Famicom version.<ref name="RG-35"/>

The first [[mobile phone]] version of the game was branded as a part of a {{nihongo|''Horii Yūji Gekijō''|堀井雄二劇場||"Yūji Horii Theater"}} trilogy along with mobile versions of ''Hokkaido Rensa Satsujin Okhotsk ni Kiyu'' and ''Karuizawa Yūkai Annai''. It was released in 2003 on [[KDDI|EZweb]] and [[Yahoo!]] Keitai services. It features a list of set commands similar to the Famicom version but also improved graphics, no free-moving cursor, and a save function.<ref name="sbg" /> The games of the trilogy, which was retitled {{nihongo|''Yuji Horii Mysteries''|堀井雄二ミステリーズ}}, were re-released in 2005 and 2006 on the same services. The second ''Portopia'' version possesses the same content as the first mobile one, in addition to updated graphics, [[background music]], a bonus function obtained after completing the game, and a hint option which nullifies the ending bonus if it is used too frequently.<ref name="itmedia" /><ref name="official" />

The game is also featured as [[Square Enix]]'s [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] technology preview for GDC 2023 featuring [[natural language processing]] functionalities such as [[natural language understanding]] and [[natural language generation]]. A public version was released worldwide on 24 April 2023 without the natural language generation features out of fear for the software being used to generate inappropriate content.<ref>{{cite news |last=Colantonio |first=Giovanni |date=21 April 2023 |title=Square Enix's free AI game isn't selling me on the tech's power |work=[[Digital Trends|digitaltrends.com]] |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/square-enix-ai-game-portopia-impressions/ |access-date=2023-04-25}}</ref> It was poorly received by fans and critics.<ref>{{cite news |title=Square Enix's free 'AI tech preview' has a Steam user rating of Very Negative and deserves it| url=https://www.pcgamer.com/square-enixs-free-ai-tech-preview-has-a-steam-user-rating-of-very-negative-and-deserves-it/ |work=[[PC Gamer|PCGamer.com]] |date=24 April 2023}}</ref>

==Reception and legacy==
