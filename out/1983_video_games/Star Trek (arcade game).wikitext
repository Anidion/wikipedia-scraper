'''''Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator''''' is a [[Space flight simulator game|space combat simulation]] [[arcade video game]] based on the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' [[television program]] and movie series, and released by [[Sega]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Trek|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=1074&image=2|work=The Arcade Flyer Archive|publisher=[[Killer List of Videogames]]|access-date=7 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="copyright database">US Copyright Database listed date of publication 1983-01-21</ref> ''Star Trek'' uses color [[vector graphics]] for both a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] display and a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[First-person shooter|first-person]] perspective.<ref>{{KLOV game|9770|Star Trek}}</ref> The player controls the [[Starship Enterprise|Starship ''Enterprise'']] and must defend sectors from invading [[Klingon]] ships. The game includes synthesized speech

The game was manufactured in two styles of cabinets: an upright standup, and a sit-down/semi-enclosed deluxe cabinet with the player's chair modeled after the ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''{{'}}s bridge chairs with controls integrated into the chair's arms.

''Star Trek'' was ported to the  [[Commodore 64]], [[TI-99/4A]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Atari 5200]], [[Atari 2600]], [[VIC-20]], [[ColecoVision]], and [[Apple II series|Apple II]].

==Gameplay==
The player is presented with multiple views of the play field. Survival depends on the player's ability to effectively use and manage shield energy, photon torpedoes, and warp energy. These are replenished by docking with starbases, which sometimes must be saved from destruction at the hands of the Klingons.

The controls use a weighted spinner for ship heading control and buttons to activate the [[Impulse Drive|impulse engines]], [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp engines]], [[Phaser (fictional weapon)|phasers]], and [[photon torpedo]]es. The phaser button is simply marked "fire."

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Games]]'' stated in August 1983 that "''Star Trek'' is sure to be a top-grosser in the arcades this year. If you can squeeze through the crowd around the machine, you may never want to leave."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Forman|first=Tracie|title=Insert Coin Here|journal=Electronic Games|date=August 1983|volume=2|issue=6|page=100|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-08/Electronic_Games_Issue_18_Vol_02_06_1983_Aug#page/n98/mode/1up}}</ref>

''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' wrote in January 1984 that the Atari 8-bit version "sounds a lot like ''[[Star Raiders]]'' (a classic worth aspiring to). Purists will shake their heads and say 'The first is always the best,' and in this case I must agree with them", adding that the arcade version was superior. The magazine concluded that "This incarnation of Star Trek probably won't impress a hard-core Atari computer gamer".<ref name="kelley198401">{{Cite magazine |last=Kelley |first=Patrick J. |date=January 1984 |title=Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator |url=https://archive.org/stream/analog-computing-magazine-15/Analog_Computing_15_1984-01_Inside_the_600XL#page/n31/mode/2up |magazine=ANALOG Computing |page=30}}</ref>

About 500 arcade machines were given away as part of a promotion for [[Halfsies]] cereal between 1982 and 1983.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/CGliODdPFbc Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20201113232544/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGliODdPFbc Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGliODdPFbc| title = Halfsies Cereal - "Magic Motion Poster / Arcade Game Contest" (Commercial, 1983) | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In 2016, ''[[Den of Geek]]'' ranked ''Strategic Operations Simulator'' as one of the top four ''Star Trek'' games.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McKinney |first1=Luke |title=The Absolute Best & Worst Star Trek Video Games |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-absolute-best-worst-star-trek-video-games/ |website=[[Den of Geek]] |publisher=DoG Tech LLC |access-date=1 July 2022 |date=4 March 2016}}</ref>
