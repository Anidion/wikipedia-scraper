'''''Obelix''''' is a 1983 video game developed and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] for the [[Atari 2600]].

==Gameplay==
The player controls Asterix whilst Obelix marches back and forth at the top of the screen carrying a [[menhir]] on his back. The player must temporarily stun Roman legionaries and centurions so that Obelix can throw a menhir at them to kill them.<ref name="Telematch" /> If the menhir misses, the stunned Roman may wake up, in which case the player can either attempt to escape to a lower level in the game or drink a magic potion to escape through the enemy soldiers.<ref name="Tilt">{{cite news |title=Asterix |url=https://archive.org/details/Tilt009/page/n45/mode/2up?q=obelix |access-date=21 February 2021 |work=Tilt |date=January–February 1984 |page=46 |quote=nb. – the title of the review is "Asterix" but by the description and the accompanying picture this is clearly the game "Obelix"}}</ref>

==Development==
The game was released shortly after a similar game called [[Asterix (1983 game)|Asterix]], and was developed on the same licence.<ref name="Hawken" /> The game was written by [[Suki Lee]] with graphics by Dave Jolly and audio by Andrew Fuchs and Jeff Gusman.<ref name="Museum">{{cite web |title=Atari 2600: Obelix |url=https://www.atari-computermuseum.de/cx26117.htm |website=Atari Computer Museum |access-date=22 February 2021}}</ref> Lee previously wrote ''[[Math Gran Prix]]'' for the Atari 2600.<ref name="Moby Games">{{cite web |title=Suki Lee |url=https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,765428/ |website=Moby Games |access-date=22 February 2021}}</ref>

==Reception==
A review in the February 1984 edition of the German magazine ''TeleMatch'' rated the graphics as good-to-satisfactory, praised the sounds, but also found the game overly similar to the (then recently-released) Atari 2600 game ''[[Asterix (1983 game)|Asterix]]''. They summed up the game as one that people would find enjoyment in playing.<ref name="Telematch" /> A review in the January–February edition of the French magazine ''Tilt'' was generally positive about the game and complemented the graphics.<ref name="Tilt" />

In a retrospective review in 2018, Kieren Hawken praised the innovative gameplay and sound, giving the game 8/10 overall.<ref name="Hawken">{{cite book |last1=Hawken |first1=Kieren |title=The A-Z of Atari 2600 Games: Volume 3 |date=2018 |publisher=Andrews UK |isbn=9781785389092 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nS5iDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Obelix%22+Atari%22&pg=PT104 |access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref>
