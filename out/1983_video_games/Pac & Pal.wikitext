{{nihongo foot|'''''Pac & Pal'''''|パック＆パル|Pakku ando Paru|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1983 [[maze video game|maze chase]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Namco]]. It is part of the company's ''[[List of Pac-Man video games|Pac-Man]]'' series and the third to have been produced in-house. Players control [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]] as he must eat the items in an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts that pursue him. Pac-Man is assisted by a green-colored creature named Miru (also called Mil), the titular "Pal", who brings the items back to the center box. Pac-Man can also collect power-ups that allow him to briefly stun the ghosts.

''Pac & Pal'' is largely based on ''[[Super Pac-Man]]'', Namco's attempt at making a follow-up to the original ''[[Pac-Man]]''. When ''Super Pac-Man'' proved to be unsuccessful, ''Pac & Pal'' was created to refine many of its mechanics and build on its concept. The game was intended to be released in North America by [[Midway Games]] under the name ''Pac-Man & Chomp Chomp'', which replaced Miru with Pac-Man's dog from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. ''Chomp Chomp'' was never released in America and was limited to a run of 300 machines produced for several European countries. Retrospectively, it has received attention for its premise and differences compared to its predecessors and has been listed among the strangest games in the ''Pac-Man'' franchise. It is included in several [[List of Bandai Namco video game compilations|Namco compilations]] for various platforms.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC Pac & Pal (Pac-Man & Chomp Chomp).png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot, showing Pac-Man flipping over cards and collecting items locked within the maze.]]
Controls consist of a four-position joystick and a button. Using the joystick, the player guides [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]] through an enclosed maze in which several items are locked behind doors. Several face-down cards are scattered throughout the maze; when Pac-Man runs over one of these, it flips over to reveal one of the items, which becomes unlocked so Pac-Man can eat it.<ref name="USGamer"/> Two items in each maze are power-ups, which correspond to "S" cards. Upon eating one of these, Pac-Man temporarily turns blue and grows larger; the player can now press the button to fire a beam that briefly stuns the ghosts.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web |title=Pac & Pal |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8952 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |access-date=23 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428023904/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8952 |archive-date=28 April 2019}}</ref> Items include a flagship from ''[[Galaxian]]'', a red car from ''[[Rally-X]]'', a trumpet, a snowman, and a miniature Pac-Man. The items are simply different cosmetically, and all of them have the same effect.<ref name="USGamer"/>

Assisting Pac-Man is the titular "Pal" character Miru, a green-colored creature with a pink bow. Whenever any items are unlocked, Miru will try to pick one up and carry it toward the center box; if Pac-Man does not catch up to her and eat the item before she enters the box, it disappears.<ref name="KLOV"/> Once all the items are gone, the level ends and the player earns bonus points for each item eaten, receiving a larger bonus for preventing Miru from taking any of them into the box.<ref name="KLOV"/> An orange area immediately below the center box causes the ghosts to slow down whenever they are inside and obscures both them and Pac-Man, leaving only the ghosts' eyes visible.<ref name="USGamer"/> The third level and every fourth level thereafter is a bonus stage with 10 cards and no ghosts; one card shows Miru, one shows the ghost Blinky, and the other eight have dollar signs. Points are awarded for each card flipped, and Miru's card doubles the total. The stage ends immediately if Blinky is found, but the player earns a larger bonus for finding him last.<ref name="USGamer"/> The player loses one life whenever Pac-Man touches a non-stunned ghost, but can safely run through Miru at any time. When all lives are lost, the game ends.

==Development and release==
''Pac & Pal'' was developed and published by [[Namco]] in July 1983 in Japan. It is the third game in the ''[[List of Pac-Man video games|Pac-Man]]'' series that was made by Namco themselves, as ''Pac-Man''{{'}}s North American distributor [[Midway Games]] had produced many of their own sequels that Namco had little involvement with. ''Pac & Pal'' is largely based on ''[[Super Pac-Man]]'', Namco's own sequel to the original, and retains a similar graphical style and many of its mechanics.<ref name="USGamer"/> With the ''Pac-Man'' brand increasing in popularity in Japan, Namco sought to produce a follow-up that matched its success. ''Super Pac-Man'' was largely unsuccessful, so ''Pac & Pal'' was made to improve on its flaws and update its core features.<ref name="USGamer"/> Yuriko Keino, who is best known for her work on games such as ''[[Dig Dug]]'' and ''[[Xevious]]'', composed the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web |title=「ゼビウス」「ディグダグ」の楽曲を手掛けた慶野由利子氏が語るナムコサウンド。トークイベント「The Art Of Video Game」をレポート |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20200227101/ |website=[[4gamer.net]] |publisher=Aetas, Inc. |access-date=30 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307153125/https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20200227101/ |archive-date=7 March 2020 |language=ja |date=27 February 2020}}</ref> Namco and Midway had plans to release ''Pac & Pal'' in North America under the new name ''Pac-Man & Chomp Chomp'', which replaced Miru with Pac-Man's spherical dog from the [[Pac-Man (TV series)|Hanna-Barbera cartoon series]].<ref>{{cite news |title=PAC-MAN と 陽気な仲間たち |url=https://namcokid47.tumblr.com/image/149911062927 |access-date=23 February 2020 |agency=Namco Community Magazine NG |issue=3 |publisher=[[Namco]] |date=1983 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200223165757/https://namcokid47.tumblr.com/image/149911062927 |archive-date=23 February 2020 |pages=25–26 |language=ja}}</ref><ref name="HG101"/> ''Pac-Man & Chomp Chomp'' was never released in North America due to the market being over-saturated with ''Pac-Man'' games.

''Pac & Pal'' never saw a home release until 1998, where it was included in the Japan-exclusive arcade collection ''[[Namco History|Namco History Vol. 3]]'' for [[Windows 95]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=funatsu@impress.co.jp |title=キャラクターモノ大特集の「NAMCO HISTORY VOL.3」6月発売 ほか |url=https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/article/980327/game.htm |website=PC Watch |publisher=Impress Group |access-date=29 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326204810/https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/article/980327/game.htm |archive-date=26 March 2016 |language=ja |date=27 March 1998}}</ref> Toy manufacturer [[Jakks Pacific]] included the game in many of their ''Pac-Man''-branded "plug'n play" controllers throughout the mid-2000s.

While ''Pac & Pal'' saw success in its first few months on the market,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型新製品 (New Videos-Table Type)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=218|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 August 1983|page=27|lang=ja}}</ref> it was relatively a commercial failure and remained obscure for many years. The game's drastic differences compared to the original ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Super Pac-Man]]'' and its limited production run have been attributed to its downfall.<ref name="USGamer"/> Retrospectively, ''Pac & Pal'' has gained attention for its many changes to the gameplay of its predecessors, and is seen among the stranger entries in the ''Pac-Man'' franchise.

In 1998, Anthony Baize of ''[[Allgame]]'' was largely critical of the game. He described its gameplay as "horrible", and criticized it for being too distant from the gameplay of the original ''Pac-Man''. He wrote: "Overall, ''Pac & Pal'' is a travesty. In my mind, it holds the title as worst and weirdest ''Pac-Man'' sequel ever unleashed upon the world. Avoid this game."<ref name="Allgame"/> In his review of the [[Xbox 360]] version of ''[[Pac-Man Museum]]'', ''Hardcore Gamer''{{'}}s Jahanzeb Khan called it a "far more unusual sequel" to ''Pac-Man'', and criticized Miru for being more of a hindrance than an aid to the player.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Khan |first1=Jahanzeb |title=Review: Pac-Man Museum |url=https://hardcoregamer.com/2014/03/01/review-pac-man-museum/76105/ |website=Hardcore Gamer |access-date=23 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429184239/https://hardcoregamer.com/2014/03/01/review-pac-man-museum/76105/ |archive-date=29 April 2019 |date=1 March 2014}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', Preston Burt listed it among the weirdest ''Pac-Man'' sequels for the addition of a second player character and its premise, saying that: "If you have no idea what's happening in this game, you're not alone."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burt |first1=Preston |title=9 Weird Arcade Iterations of Pac-Man |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/9-weird-arcade-iterations-of-pac-man.html |website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |access-date=23 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405173448/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/9-weird-arcade-iterations-of-pac-man.html |archive-date=5 April 2016 |date=31 July 2015}}</ref>

Jeremy Parish of ''[[USgamer]]'' retrospectively reviewed ''Pac & Pal'' in commemoration of its 30th anniversary in 2013. He claimed that it made for one of the stranger entries in the series for its substantially different gameplay compared to ''Pac-Man'' and ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''. Parish also said that many of the game's additions, namely Miru and the power-up items, detracted from ''Pac-Man''{{'s}} more minimalist approach and appeal.<ref name="USGamer">{{cite web |last1=Parish |first1=Jeremy |title=Remembering Pac & Pal, Pac-Man's Strangest Arcade Adventure |url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/weekly-classic-pacpal |website=[[USgamer]] |access-date=23 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123175821/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/weekly-classic-pacpal |archive-date=23 January 2018 |date=23 July 2013}}</ref> Ultimately, Parish said that the new mechanics and difference in play made it a much more difficult and stressful game compared to its predecessors, feeling that players would have a hard time succumbing to its "strange" ideas and gameplay that had a more action-oriented pace to it.<ref name="USGamer"/> He concluded his review with: "While Namco clearly hoped to sustain ''Pac-Man''{{'}}s tremendous legacy with an inventive follow-up, ''Pac & Pal'' hastened the series' demise. ''Pac & Pal'' was one in a string of duds and doesn't hold up very well in retrospect -- it's a real oddball of a game. Sometimes, though, weirdness is just as interesting in hindsight as true significance."<ref name="USGamer"/> Bobinator of ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' argued that the difference in gameplay made ''Pac & Pal'' standout from other ''Pac-Man'' sequels, and that it helped make the game feel fresh and unique. He also believed that it represents Namco's willingness to experiment with the mechanics and concepts established in the original. Bobinator wrote: "Sadly, this would be the last time Namco would ever experiment quite this much with their well-used maze game formula. While ''Pac-Man'' would soon move into new genres entirely, later maze games would choose to play it safe. Experimentation like this would never be seen in the series again."<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |author1=Bobinator |title=Pac & Pal |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/pac-pal/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=23 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816130150/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/pac-pal/ |archive-date=16 August 2019 |date=12 August 2019}}</ref>
