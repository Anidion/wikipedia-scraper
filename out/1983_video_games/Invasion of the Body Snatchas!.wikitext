''[[Sinclair User]]'' reviewed the game in their magazine, "At last! a version as fast and furious and as frustratingly addictive as the arcade original Landers, Mutants, Bombers, Pods, Swarmers and much much more combine to produce the ultimate space game!"<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/Sinclair_Programs_8403 |title=Sinclair Programs 8403}}</ref>{{-}}
