'''''Star Wars: Jedi Arena''''' is a [[lightsaber]] battle video game written by Rex Bradford for the [[Atari 2600]] and published by [[Parker Brothers]] in 1983. It is the first ''Star Wars'' video game to feature lightsabers.<ref name=gwr2017/> The goal of the game, based on one scene in the [[Star Wars (film)|original ''Star Wars'' film]], is to take out the opponent with the Seeker ball while defending oneself from incoming laser blasts using one's lightsaber.

Following the adequate sales of their first ''Star Wars'' game'', [[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1982 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Parker Brothers went on to continue developing ''Star Wars'' titles, one of which is ''Star Wars: Jedi Arena'', programmed by Rex Bradford. Although the game's reception was mixed at the time of release, with sound effects being praised and primarily the abstract combat being criticized, its legacy is largely negative, with several modern critics referring to the game as one of the worst [[List of Star Wars video games|''Star Wars'' games]] of all time.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Star Wars Jedi Arena gameplay.gif|thumb|left|Gameplay, including a remote and two lightsabers|alt=Animated footage of typical gameplay, showing two lightsabers deflecting laser blasts from a Seeker ball from an overhead perspective.]]
In ''Star Wars: Jedi Arena'', two [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]], one blue and one red, who are depicted from a top-down perspective, face each other during [[lightsaber]] training. Player one is blue; the red Jedi is either a human- or computer-controlled opponent. Players control their lightsabers with the [[Paddle (game controller)|paddle controller]] to defend themselves from the laser blasts coming from the Seeker ball, fired by the opponent. The Seeker will regularly turn wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The objective of the game is to fire laser blasts from the Seeker at the opponent's shield and finally directly at the opponent by aiming in the direction that the lightsaber is pointing.<ref name=GT-gameplay/> The game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed; on the highest level, the Seeker is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits, and the winner becomes a Jedi Master.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=502|title=Star Wars: Jedi Arena manual|publisher=[[Parker Brothers]]|via=atariage.com|date=1983|access-date=October 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Development and release==
Although ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1982 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' was not a huge success, it sold well enough to encourage [[Parker Brothers]] to develop more ''Star Wars'' titles.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAjYCgAAQBAJ&q=star+wars+jedi+arena+back+game+sold+parker+brothers&pg=PT325|title=Star Wars FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Trilogy That Changed the Movies|first=Mark|last=Clark|via=[[Google Books]]|publisher=[[Applause Theatre & Cinema Books]]|isbn=9781480360181|date=August 1, 2015|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref> In the December 11, 1982, issue of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', it was reported that Parker Brothers was developing its second game cartridge.<ref name=GS-retro/> Titled ''Star Wars: Jedi Arena'', the game was set for release the following month.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8iMEAAAAMBAJ&q=star+wars+jedi+arena&pg=PT7|page=8|title=''Billboard'' Vol. 94 No. 49|via=[[Google Books]]|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=December 11, 1982|access-date=October 17, 2016}}</ref> During ''Jedi Arena''{{'}}s production, Parker Brothers relied upon an abstract approach to combat that took advantage of "the unique technologies and situations of the ''Star Wars'' universe".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oK3D4i5ldKgC&q=star+wars+jedi+arena+parker+brothers&pg=PA96|page=96|title=Before the Crash: Early Video Game History|first=Mark J.P.|last=Wolf|via=[[Google Books]]|publisher=[[Wayne State University]]|isbn=9780814337226|date=June 15, 2012|access-date=October 22, 2016}}</ref> The game was programmed by Rex Bradford<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqePfdz_x6gC&q=star+wars+jedi+arena+programmed+by&pg=PA166|page=166|title=Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System|first1=Nick|last1=Montfort|first2=Ian|last2=Bogost|via=[[Google Books]]|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|isbn=9780262254939|date=January 9, 2009|access-date=October 22, 2016}}</ref> and inspired by one scene in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in which Luke Skywalker defends himself from the Seeker ball's incoming laser bolts with his lightsaber on board the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.<ref name=gameplay-film/> The game was released for the [[Atari 2600]] as scheduled, in January 1983.<ref name=GS-retro/>

==Reception==
''Star Wars: Jedi Arena'' received mixed reviews from critics in the 1980s. Adam Thompson of ''Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games'' likened the mechanism of damaging the opponent's shield to smashing bricks in ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'' and praised the game's glowing multi-colored laser blasts and the sound effects, the latter of which he felt added realism to the game.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n2/jediarena.php|page=42|title=''Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games'' Vol. 1, No. 2|first=Adam|last=Thompson|magazine=atarimagazines.com|date=Fall 1983|access-date=October 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103001142/http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n2/jediarena.php|archive-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> According to Peter Brown of ''[[GameSpot]]'', however, the main criticisms of the game were the stationary Jedi and abstract combat,<ref name=GS-retro>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-history-of-star-wars-video-games-part-1-1982-1998/1100-6419998/|title=The History of ''Star Wars'' Video Games Part 1: 1982–1998|first=Peter|last=Brown|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=May 31, 2014|access-date=October 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103000930/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-history-of-star-wars-video-games-part-1-1982-1998/1100-6419998/|archive-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> for the opposite of which action fans were expecting.<ref name=GT-gameplay>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7ok_vEAke0 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211220/e7ok_vEAke0 |archive-date=2021-12-20 |url-status=live|title=''Star Wars'' Retrospective – Episode 1|via=[[YouTube]]|work=[[GameTrailers]]|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=May 17, 2016|access-date=October 20, 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Benj Edwards, writing for [[PCMag|PCMag.com]], claimed that ''Jedi Arena'' "may secretly be the best Star Wars video game ever made."<ref>{{Cite web|title=7 Forgotten Atari 2600 Classics|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/7-forgotten-atari-2600-classics|access-date=2021-03-04|website=PCMAG|language=en}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The legacy of ''Jedi Arena'' among modern critics is extremely negative. Ian Dransfield of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' ranked it as one of the 5 worst ''Star Wars'' games ever, noting that the game has not aged well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/star-wars/feature/a773832/the-5-worst-star-wars-games-ever/|title=5 terrible ''Star Wars'' games from the Dark Side of the Force|first=Ian|last=Dransfield|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=November 16, 2015|access-date=October 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103001503/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/star-wars/feature/a773832/the-5-worst-star-wars-games-ever/|archive-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> Lewis Packwood of ''[[Kotaku]]'' ranked the game second-to-worst, believing that the game should not have been based on one particular scene in ''Star Wars'' involving Luke Skywalker defending himself from a "floaty beach ball".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/05/04/every-star-wars-game-ever-from-worst-to-best|title=Every ''Star Wars'' Game Ever, From Worst to Best|first=Lewis|last=Packwood|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=May 4, 2016|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> In the book ''Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide'', Brett Weiss criticized the game's controls, its overall "misguided" concept (given that the Jedi never actually engage in a duel), and the gameplay for "[relying] too much on luck".<ref name=gameplay-film>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&q=star+wars+jedi+arena&pg=PA113|pages=113–114|title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide|first=Brett|last=Weiss|via=[[Google Books]]|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|isbn=9780786432264|date=March 7, 2012|access-date=October 22, 2016}}</ref> Several other sources described ''Jedi Arena'' to be either lamentable<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/star-wars-roundup|page=1|title=Retro Roundup: ''Star Wars''|first1=Jeremy|last1=Parish|first2=Mike|last2=Nelson|work=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=May 25, 2007|access-date=October 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20161111015607/http://www.1up.com/features/star-wars-roundup |archive-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=July 2008|title=The Making of...
