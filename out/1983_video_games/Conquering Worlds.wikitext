==Reception==
James A.

It is similar to ''Galactic Attack'' and ''Titan Empire''. If you own either of the two games, you will find ''Conquering Worlds'' to be similar."<ref name="CGW15">{{cite magazine |last=McPherson |first=James A. |title=Micro-Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1984 |volume=1 |issue=15 |pages=44, 35}}</ref>
