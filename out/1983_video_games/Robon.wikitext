==Reception==
''[[CRASH (magazine)|Crash]]'' magazine said, "This ''[[Frenzy (1982 video game)|Frenzy]]'' / ''[[Berzerk (video game)|Berserk]]'' game, unlike most of Softek’s other programs, is not very good. At the slowest of the nine skill levels it’s a bit boring, and at the fastest it’s quite meaningless. The usual format is followed; [[electricity|electrified]] walls, [[robot]]s, unkillable ‘Raboks’ which leave exploding [[land mine|mines]] behind".<ref>{{cite journal |date=February 1984 |title=Living Guide... |journal=[[CRASH (magazine)|Crash]] |issue=1 |pages=56}}</ref>
