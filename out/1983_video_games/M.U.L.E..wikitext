'''''M.U.L.E.''''' is a multiplayer [[video game]] written for [[Atari 8-bit computers]]  by Ozark Softscape. Designer [[Danielle Bunten Berry]] (credited as Dan Bunten) takes advantage of the four [[joystick]] ports of the Atari 400 and 800 to allow four-player simultaneous play. Published in 1983, ''M.U.L.E.'' was one of the first five games from new company [[Electronic Arts]], alongside ''[[Axis Assassin]]'', ''[[Archon: The Light and the Dark]]'', ''[[Worms?]]'', and ''[[Hard Hat Mack]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Corriea |first1=Alexa Ray |title=30 years ago Electronic Arts shipped its first batch of five games |url=https://www.polygon.com/2013/5/21/4351144/30-years-ago-electronic-arts-shipped-its-first-batch-of-five-games |website=Polygon |date=May 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=28 Years of EA History |url=https://www.ea.com/news/today-in-ea-history |website=Electronic Arts |date=May 20, 2011}}</ref> It is primarily a [[turn-based strategy game]], but incorporates real-time elements where players compete directly as well as aspects that simulate [[economics]].

The game was ported to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], and [[IBM PC compatible]]s (as a [[self-booting disk]]).<ref>{{moby developer|id=8515|name=Danielle Berry}}</ref>  Japanese versions exist for the [[PC-88]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Entry with PC-88 info and shots at Mobygames|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/pc88/mule|access-date=19 May 2011}}</ref> [[Sharp X1]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Entry at thelegacy.de with screenshots of the X1 port|url=http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/6820/|access-date=19 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513100520/http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/6820/|archive-date=13 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[MSX2]] computers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Entry at Generation-MSX|url=http://www.generation-msx.nl/msxdb/softwareinfo/1224|access-date=19 May 2011}}</ref> Like the subsequent Atari 8-bit models, none of these systems allow four players with separate joysticks. The Commodore 64 version lets four players share joysticks, with two players using the keyboard during action portions.<ref>{{cite web|title=M.U.L.E.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:M.U.L.E._Atari_8-bit_PAL_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Atari 8-bit screenshot]]

Set on the fictional planet Irata (''[[Atari]]'' backward), the game is an exercise in [[supply and demand]] [[economics]] involving competition among four players, with computer opponents automatically filling in for any missing players. Players choose the race of their colonist, which has advantages and disadvantages that can be paired to their respective strategies. To win, players not only compete against each other to amass the largest amount of wealth, but must also cooperate for the survival of the colony.

Central to the game is the acquisition and use of ''Multiple Use Labor Elements'', or ''M.U.L.E.''s, to develop and harvest resources from the player's [[real estate]]. Depending on how it is outfitted, a M.U.L.E. can be configured to harvest Energy, Food, Smithore (from which M.U.L.E.s are constructed), and Crystite (a valuable mineral available only at the "Tournament" level). Players must balance supply and demand of these elements, buying what they need and selling what they don't. Players may exploit or create shortages by refusing to sell to other players or to the "store", which raises the price of the resource on the following turns. Scheming between players is encouraged by allowing [[collusion]], which initiates a mode allowing a private transaction. Crystite is the one commodity that is not influenced by supply and demand considerations, being deemed to be sold off-world, so the strategy with this resource is somewhat different; a player may attempt to maximize production without fear of having too much supply for the demand.

[[Image:M.U.L.E..png|framed|right|A Multiple Use Labor Element, the eponymous M.U.L.E.]]
Each resource is required to do certain things on each turn. For instance, if a player is short on Food, there is less time to take one's turn. If a player is short on Energy, some land plots won't produce any output, while a shortage of Smithore raises the price of M.U.L.E.s and prevents the store from manufacturing new M.U.L.E.s.

Players must deal with periodic random events such as runaway M.U.L.E.s, sunspot activity, theft by space pirates, and meteorites,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/081/081722p1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618153951/http://pc.ign.com/articles/081/081722p1.html|archive-date=2007-06-18 |title=PC Retroview: M.U.L.E. - PC Feature at IGN |publisher=Pc.ign.com |date=2000-07-05 |url-status=dead|access-date=2010-07-26}}</ref> with potentially destructive and beneficial effects. Favorable random events almost never happen to the player currently in first place, while unfavorable events never happen to the player in last place.<ref name="cgw199208">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=97 | title=Designing People... | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1992 | access-date=3 July 2014 | pages=48–54}}</ref> Similarly, when two players want to buy a resource at the same price, the player in the losing position automatically wins. Players also can [[Hunt the Wumpus|hunt the mountain wampus]] for a cash reward.

== Development ==

According to Jim Rushing (one of the four original partners in Ozark Softscape), ''M.U.L.E.'' was initially called ''Planet Pioneers'' during development.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldofmule.net/tiki-index.php?page=MechanicalDonkeysJimRushing | title = Mechanical Donkeys | access-date = 2009-03-24 | last = Szczepaniak | first = John | work = The Gamer's Quarter, Issue #6 | publisher = World of M.U.L.E. | quote = Rushing: We can discuss more on phone, but ... Trivia: Working title of the game was "Planet Pioneers." | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080912033147/http://www.worldofmule.net/tiki-index.php?page=MechanicalDonkeysJimRushing | archive-date = 2008-09-12 | url-status = dead }}</ref> It was intended to be similar to ''Cartels & Cutthroats'', with more graphics, better playability, and a focus on multiplayer.<ref name="CGW"/> The real-time auction element came largely from lead designer [[Danielle Bunten Berry|Danielle Bunten]]'s ''Wheeler Dealers''. The board game [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'']] was used as a model for the game because of its encouragement of social interaction and for several of the game's elements: the acquisition and development of land as a primary task, a production advantage for grouped plots, different species (à la the different player tokens), and random events similar to "Chance" cards.<ref name = "CGW">{{Cite news | date = April 1984 | last = Bunten | first = Dan | author-link = Danielle Bunten Berry | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Dispatches / Insights from the Strategy Game Design Front| pages = 17, 42 }}</ref>  Additional game features such as claim jumping, loans, and crystite depletion were discarded for adding complexity without enhancing gameplay.

The setting was inspired by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', wherein galactic colonization is in the style of the [[American Old West]]: A few pioneers with drive and primitive tools. The M.U.L.E. itself is based on the idea of the [[genetically modified animal]] in Heinlein's novel and given the appearance of a [[AT-AT|''Star Wars'' Imperial Walker]]. Another Heinlein novel, ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'', provided the decision to not have any government or external authority. In the game's original designs, land was sold by auction, but this caused a [[feedback loop]] in which the wealthiest player had the most land and thus made the most money; thus, the developers created the "land authority" that gives each player a free plot of land each turn.<ref name = "CGW" />

Ozark Softscape developed the game for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] first because of its policy of developing for the most advanced computers then [[porting]] them to other platforms, removing or altering features such as [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s as necessary. Bunten stated that Ozark did not port the game to the [[Apple II]] because "''M.U.L.E.'' can't be done for an Apple".<ref name="bunten198412">{{cite magazine | title=Dispatches / Insights From the Strategy Game Design Front | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1984 | author=Bunten, Dan | pages=40}}</ref> The [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] port of ''M.U.L.E'' was developed by K-Byte Software, an affiliate of Electronic Arts, and published by IBM.
