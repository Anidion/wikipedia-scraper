==Gameplay==

In ''Cohen's Towers'' the player plays the part of Allen, starting his new job as a mail boy. He has to collect mail parcels one at the time from different floors and deliver them to any of the three available 'mail drops'. To move up and down between the floors the player can use different elevators, but if he stays on one for too long a falling plant pot will knock him off. The player's work is also hindered by a dog pursuing him on most of the floors, or a sleepwalker. 

Once the player collected and deposited all the parcels in the building, the Boss shows up and takes him to the next one. There are three different buildings in the game – Fanda, Datamost, and Cohen's Tower – each one harder to complete.

The game's music is one of the first examples of [[adaptive music]]. Different tunes accompany unusual occurrences: a dog chasing the player, a sleepwalker appearance, the Boss checking on the player's work. The main theme is an arrangement of [[Scott Joplin]]'s "[[Elite Syncopations]]".

==Reception==
Steve Panak wrote in his column in the 1984 ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' holiday issue, "don't even consider buying it. ''Cohen's Towers'' gives big business a bad name, and all copies should be piled up and turned into a towering inferno."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Panak |first1=Steve |title=Panak Strikes: Cohen's Towers |journal=ANALOG Computing |date=December 1984 |issue=25 |pages=54–55 |url=https://archive.org/details/analog-computing-magazine-25/page/n59/mode/2up}}</ref> In a 1985 review for ''[[Page 6]]'' Jim Short wrote: "it is an original and highly addictive game with great graphics and even better sound. [...] ''Cohen's Towers'' is an excellent little game that I can highly recommend."<ref name="page6"/> Lloyd Davies, writing in ''[[Ahoy!]]'', praised the "colorful scrolling screens and clever visual effects" and the game's learning curve, calling it "an arcade-quality piece of software."<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Davies|first=Lloyd|date=August 1984|title=Cohen's Towers|url=https://archive.org/details/ahoy-magazine-08/page/n59/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Ahoy!]]|page=60}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[InfoWorld]]'' in March 1984, Scott Mace called it "one of the most humorous video games ever," joking that: "Now, for every mail clerk, everywhere [...], there's a video game that sums up what a fun job it can be."<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Mace|first=Scott|date=March 5, 1984|title=A hard day at the office|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mS4EAAAAMBAJ&dq=Cohen%27s+Towers&pg=PA47|magazine=[[InfoWorld]]|volume=6|issue=10|page=47|access-date=February 27, 2021}}</ref> In the journal ''Education, Research and Perspectives'', Michael Scriven called it a "novelty" game whose "whimsy is central though not oppressive."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scriven|first=Michael|date=1987|title=Taking Games Seriously|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYZYAAAAYAAJ&q=Towers|journal=Education, Research and Perspectives|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]]|volume=14|issue=1|pages=82–135|issn=1446-0017}}</ref>
