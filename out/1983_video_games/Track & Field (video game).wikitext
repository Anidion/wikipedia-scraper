'''''Track & Field''''', also known as {{nihongo foot|'''''Hyper Olympic'''''|ハイパーオリンピック|Haipā Orinpikku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan and Europe, is an [[Olympic video games|Olympic-themed]] [[sports video game]] developed by [[Konami]] and released as an [[arcade video game]] in 1983. The Japanese release sported an official license for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. In Europe, the game was initially released under the Japanese title ''Hyper Olympic'' in 1983,<ref name="EU">{{cite web |title=Video Game Flyers: Hyper Olympic, Konami (EU) |url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=2347 |website=The Arcade Flyer Archive |access-date=6 May 2021}}</ref> before re-releasing under the US title ''Track & Field'' in early 1984.<ref name="CVG30">{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action: We Discover What's New in Blackpool |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 March 1984 |issue=30 (April 1984) |page=26 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/187/525}}</ref>

Players compete in a series of events, most involving alternately pressing two buttons as quickly as possible to make the onscreen character run faster. It has a horizontal [[side-scrolling]] format, depicting one or two tracks at a time, a large scoreboard that displays world records and current runs, and a packed audience in the background.<ref name="Lendino"/>

The game was a worldwide commercial success in arcades, becoming one of the most successful [[1984 in video games|arcade games of 1984]]. Konami and Centuri also held a 1984 ''Track & Field'' [[video game competition]] that drew more than a million players internationally, holding the record for the largest organized video game competition of all time {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. It was followed by sequels, including ''[[Hyper Sports]]'', and similar [[Olympic video games]] from other companies. It led to a resurgence of arcade sports games and inspired [[Namco]]'s side-scrolling [[platform game]] ''[[Pac-Land]]'' (1984).

==Gameplay==
In the original arcade game, the player uses two "run" buttons (or a [[trackball]] in later units that replaced buttons damaged from overuse) and one "action" button to control an athlete competing in the following six events:<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10180|title=Track & Field - Videogame by Konami|website=www.arcade-museum.com|access-date=2016-06-10}}</ref> 
* [[100 metres|100 meter dash]] – running by quickly alternating button presses.
* [[Long jump]] – running by alternating button press and correct timing for jump {{mdash}} hold jump button to set angle (42 degrees is optimal).
* [[Javelin throw]] – running by alternating button presses and then using action button correct timing for angle (43 degrees is optimal).
* [[110 metre hurdles|110 meter hurdles]] – running by alternating button presses and using action button to time jumps.
* [[Hammer throw]] – spinning initiated by pressing a run button once and then correctly timed press of action button to choose angle (45 degrees is optimal).
* [[High jump]] – running (speed set by computer) and then action button must be held down to determine angle of jump {{mdash}} once in the air, the run button can be rapidly pressed for additional height.
[[Image:Track & Field 01.png|thumb|right|[[Long jump]] event]]
In each event, there is a qualifying time or level that the player must achieve to advance to the next event; failing to qualify (in one heat for running events or three tries in the other events) will reduce the player's number of lives by one, but if none are present in his/her disposal, the game will end.<ref name="auto"/> Players earn extra lives per 100,000 points scored.
[[Image:Track & Field 02.png|thumb|right|Start of the 100m dash]]
The game can accommodate up to four players, who compete in pairs for the running events and individually for the others. If there are fewer than four players, the remaining slots are played by the computer (or player "CPU"). In all multiplayer heats, though, the relative performances of the players have no effect on the game, and advancing is based solely on qualifying times. While most multiplayer arcade games had each set of controls relative to the players going from left to right, this game (which has two sets of controls) had a somewhat different setup. The left set of controls were for players 2 and 4, while the right set was for players 1 and 3. This is one of the few classic arcade games where single player mode was played on the right set of controls rather than the left. If a player completes all six events after a brief medal ceremony, he or she is sent back to the field for another round, with higher qualifying levels, however the game can be configured to conclude after the final event.

Because the game responded to repeatedly pressing the "run" buttons at high frequency, players of the arcade version resorted to various tricks such as rapidly swiping a coin or ping-pong ball over the buttons, or using a metal ruler which was repeated struck such that it would vibrate and press the buttons. As a result, arcade operators reported high rates of damage to the buttons and later versions had modifications to prevent such actions.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Release==
''Hyper Olympic'' was introduced at Tokyo's [[Amusement Machine Show]] (AM Show) in September 1983. Despite the hype for [[laserdisc games]] prior to the show, ''Hyper Olympic'' ended up being the most well-received game at the show. According to ''[[Cash Box]]'' magazine, several people claimed there were "cursory similarities" to ''[[Activision Decathlon]]'', which was introduced a month earlier. ''Hyper Olympic'' was licensed to [[Centuri]] for North American distribution. However, [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] had been chosen as the official Olympics video game sponsor, so Centuri were unable to keep the title ''Hyper Olympic''.<ref name="JAMMA">{{cite magazine |title="Somber" JAMMA Show Hosts Five Laser Disc Games |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=October 15, 1983 |pages=32, 34 |url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox45unse_18/page/45}}</ref> It was subsequently introduced in North America as ''Track & Field'' at the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) show in October 1983. Despite the hype for laserdisc games prior to the show, many operators and distributors ended up considering ''Track & Field'' to be the biggest hit at the event.<ref name="CashMachine">{{cite magazine |title=Cash Machine |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=November 12, 1983 |pages=30–4 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/80s/1983/CB-1983-11-12.PDF#page=32}}</ref>

===Ports===
Konami licensed the North American home video game rights to [[Atari, Inc.]]<ref name="GM224"/> They initially [[Port (software)|ported]] ''Track & Field'' to the [[Atari 2600]] console and the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], followed by versions for the [[Apple II]] and the [[Commodore 64]] on the [[Atarisoft]] label. A port for the [[Atari 5200]], identical to the Atari 8-bit computer version, was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reichert |first=Matt |title=Track & Field |website=AtariProtos.com |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/5200/software/trackfield/trackfield.htm |access-date=September 19, 2014}}</ref> The 2600 version was among the new games to use Atari's "super chip" technology, enabling enhanced graphics and gameplay variety compared to what was previously possible on the 2600.<ref name="CE"/>

When Konami ported ''Track & Field'' to the Famicom (as ''Hyper Olympic''), they only included four out of six events. Afterwards, they converted ''Hyper Sports'' to the Famicom as well, this time including three of the ''Hyper Sports'' events and one more event from ''Track & Field''. By the time the NES gained popularity in the United States, Konami retooled the game for release in America by including all eight events from both games in one cartridge. Of the original six events from ''Track & Field'', only the hammer throw is missing; in its place, however, are skeet shooting, archery, and triple jump.

The [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] versions were only released as part of the ''Game, Set and Match II'' compilation in 1988, and are poorly regarded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpczone.net/index.php?game=1511 |title=The Amstrad CPC Resource : : Track and Field by Ocean Software for the Amstrad CPC/GX 4000 |publisher=CPC Zone |access-date=2009-07-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305150932/http://www.cpczone.net/index.php?game=1511 |archive-date=2012-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ZXDB Powered Software Search: Game, Set and Match 2 |url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=11732 |website=SpectrumComputing |access-date=14 June 2018}}</ref>

The NES version of ''Track & Field'' was re-released in Europe in 1992 as ''Track & Field in Barcelona'' by [[Kemco]] in the light of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]. The opening song for the NES version is the ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' theme by [[Vangelis]] (which was also used in the arcade version's high score screen).

The arcade game received positive reviews upon release. Gene Lewin of ''[[Play Meter]]'' magazine scored it 8 out of 10, but said it would be "a definite 10" if released as a more affordable conversion kit. The review called it the best dedicated arcade game at the AMOA 1983 show and praised the gameplay, "excellent" graphics, "fantastic" sound, and originality, stating that having "different track and field events is an original idea" and "certainly different" than the other sports games [[List of baseball video games|based on baseball]], football or [[List of basketball video games|basketball]].<ref name="PM">{{cite magazine |last1=Lewin |first1=Gene |title=Gene's Judgements: Critiquing AMOA Show Conversions, Dedicated Games |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=January 15, 1984 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=60–3 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-10-number-2-january-15th-1984/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%2010%2C%20Number%202%20-%20January%2015th%201984/page/60/mode/2up}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called it a "great game for all you armchair sports enthusiasts"<ref name="CVG30"/> but said it could cause a cramped finger.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Not So Active Athletics!

==Competition==
In 1984, Konami and Centuri jointly held an international ''Track & Field'' [[video game competition]] that drew more than a million players from across Japan and North America. ''[[Play Meter]]'' in 1984 called it "the coin-op event of the year" and an event on a scale never before achieved in the industry.<ref name="Sharpe"/> As of 2016, it holds the record for the largest organized video game competition of all time, according to ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Baker |first1=Chris |title=How 'Track & Field' Launched World's Biggest Video Game Tournament |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/how-konamis-track-field-launched-worlds-biggest-game-tournament-103592/ |access-date=6 October 2021 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=16 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Twin Galaxies]]' ''Official Video Game & Pinball Book of World Records - Arcade Volume'', lists history's largest video game contest as the "1984 March of Dimes International Konami/Centuri Track & Field Challenge". The editors said: "More than 1 million contestants played ''Track & Field'' between April 30 and May 26, hoping to be among three finalists going to Japan to represent the USA. As a fundraiser for the March of Dimes, the event was held in [[Aladdin's Castle]] arcades and National Convenience Stores. Gary West of Oklahoma City won the U.S. Finals, but Phil Britt, of Riverside, California, won the World Championship in Tokyo on June 10, 1984".

''Track & Field'' had an impact on the wider [[sports video game]] genre, leading a resurgence for the genre in arcades during the 1980s. Following the release of ''Track & Field'', the arcade industry began producing sports games at levels not seen since the days of ''[[Pong]]'' and its clones nearly a decade earlier.<ref name="Lendino">{{cite book |last1=Lendino |first1=Jamie |title=Attract Mode: The Rise and Fall of Coin-Op Arcade Games |date=27 September 2020 |publisher=Steel Gear Press |pages=272, 334 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6wCEAAAQBAJ}}</ref> Sports video games became popular after ''Track & Field'', with a number of successful arcade sports games in 1984, including [[Nintendo]]'s [[List of boxing video games|boxing]] game ''[[Punch-Out!!

[[Namco]]'s Yoshihiro Kishimoto cited ''Track & Field'' as the biggest influence on [[side-scrolling]] platform game ''[[Pac-Land]]'' (1984). The game's controls were heavily influenced by ''Track & Field'', which allowed the player to become faster by constantly tapping the button in succession; Kishimoto thought the idea was interesting and that it would make ''Pac-Land'' stand out among other games.<ref name="Untold History">{{cite book |last1=Szczepaniak |first1=John |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers Vol. 2 |date=4 November 2015 |isbn=978-1518655319 |pages=207–208 |edition=1}}</ref>
