'''''Beamrider''''' is a [[fixed shooter]] written for the [[Intellivision]] by David Rolfe and published by [[Activision]] in 1983.<ref name="giantlist"/> The game was ported to the [[Atari 2600]] (with a slightly reduced feature set), [[Atari 5200]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[MSX]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Beamrider_Atari_8-bit_PAL_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot (Atari 8-bit)]]
''Beamrider'' takes place above [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]], where a large alien shield called the ''Restrictor Shield'' surrounds the Earth.  The player's objective is to clear the Shield's 99 sectors of alien craft while piloting the Beamrider ship.  The Beamrider is equipped with a short-range ''[[laser]] [[Lasso|lariat]]'' and a limited supply of [[torpedo]]es.  The player is given three at the start of each sector.

To clear a sector, fifteen enemy ships must be destroyed.  A "Sentinel ship" will then appear, which can be destroyed using a torpedo (if any remain) for bonus points.  Some enemy ships can only be destroyed with torpedoes, and some must simply be dodged.  Occasionally during a sector, "Yellow Rejuvenators" ([[Life (video games)#Extra lives|extra lives]]) appear.  They can be picked up for an extra ship, but if they are shot they will transform into ship-damaging debris.

Activision offered a ''Beamrider'' patch to players who could get to Sector 14 with 40,000 points and sent in a screenshot of their accomplishment.<ref name=manual2600/>

==Reception==
The ''[[Deseret News]]'' in 1984 gave the ColecoVision version of ''Beamrider'' three stars, describing it as "basically a slide-and-shoot space game."<ref name="holyoak19840530">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PqZNAAAAIBAJ&pg=7081%2C6575510 | title=Here are ColecoVision's jewels | work=Deseret News | date=1984-05-30 | accessdate=10 January 2015 | author=Holyoak, Craig | pages=4 WV}}</ref>

A reviewer for ''[[Your Commodore]]'' described the Commodore 64 version of the game as "a really good, wholesome arcade zapping game."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/02-your-commodore-magazine/Your_Commodore_Issue_02_1984_Nov#page/n31/mode/2up|title = Your Commodore Magazine Issue 02|date = November 1984}}</ref>
