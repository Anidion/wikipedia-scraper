'''''Jumping Jack''''' is a [[platform game]] designed by Albert Ball,<ref name="giantlist"/> with art by Stuart C. Ball, for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and published by [[Imagine Software]] in 1983. It was available for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and [[Dragon 32]] under the name '''''Leggit!'''''.<ref name="atarimania">{{cite web|title=Leggit!|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-leggit_2958.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref> In these versions, Jack is renamed Leaping Lenny.

==Gameplay==
Each level consists of a set of eight wraparound floors, across which holes scroll; when these holes reach the side of the screen, they move up or down to the next floor, depending on if they're scrolling to the left or right, respectively.

The goal in each level is to reach the top, by jumping through the holes; however, each time Jack jumps, a new hole is formed on a randomly chosen floor. Falling through a hole or miscalculating a jump and hitting the ceiling temporarily stuns him and leaves him vulnerable to a hole scrolling underneath him; if he falls all the way to the bottom of the level, he loses a life. Completing a level reveals a verse from the "Ballad of Jumping Jack"; the next level features an extra hole at the start and from the second level onward, monsters appear which stun Jack in the same way as a fall or mistimed jump.
