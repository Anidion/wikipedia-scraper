'''''Knot in 3D''''' is a [[ZX Spectrum]] action game by [[Malcolm Evans (computer programmer)|Malcolm Evans]] published in 1983 by [[New Generation Software]]. It resembles a three-dimensional (i.e. with three degrees of freedom instead of only two) version of the [[Tron (video game)#Light Cycles|Light cycles]] game from the film ''[[Tron]]''.

The game takes place in a 16 × 16 × 16 three-dimensional grid with the display being a first-person view of what the player can see in front of them.  Initially empty, this space is filled up by the player (who constantly moves forward) leaving a trail behind them.  There are a number of computer-controlled "chasers" doing the same thing who leave a differently coloured trail behind them.  As the player and the chasers move through the grid, it becomes more and more densely filled, and therefore there is a greater likelihood of crashing into a trail and need to change direction to avoid the trails.

==Reception==
''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' magazine commented that it was hard to see how ''Knot'' worked at first, but described it as extraordinary and addictive.<ref>{{cite journal |date=February 1984 |title=Living Guide |journal=[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]] |issue=1 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue02/Pages/Crash0200059.jpg}}</ref>  ''ZX Computing'' also said that ''Knot'' was initially confusing until the player is used to the perspective. The graphics were highlighted as some of the best fast-action colour graphics on the [[ZX Spectrum]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=October 1983 |title=Software Reviews |journal=ZX Computing|issue=8310|page=20 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ZXComputing/Issue8310/Pages/ZXComputing831000020.jpg}}</ref>

In 1997, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reflected on ''Knot in 3D'' as "a landmark title blighted by the inability of most players to think in terms of three dimensions fast enough."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Towards Reality: The Rise of 3D Gaming |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=37|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1998 |page=79}}</ref>

In 1991 [[Your Sinclair]] magazine ranked the game 60th in their top 100 Spectrum games of all time.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1991 |title=Top 100 Spectrum games of all time |journal=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=70|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html}}</ref>
