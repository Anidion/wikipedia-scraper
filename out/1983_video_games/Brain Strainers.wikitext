==Gameplay==
''Brain Strainers'' consists of two musically themed sub-games: "Follow The Leader," and "Clef Climber." The intention of the game was to provide an [[Educational game|educational video game]] experience. Skills that were targeted were eidetic musical memory and tonal accuracy.<ref name=Malnig/><ref name=BrainStrainers/><ref name=coverart/>

===Follow The Leader===

"Follow The Leader" is an [[Music video game#Eidetic music games|eidetic music game]] designed to test the player's memory.<ref name=Malnig/> Here, a pattern of musical notes are played and four colored panels light up correspondingly.  The player then has a few seconds to repeat the sequence back to the computer.<ref name=Brown>Brown, Christopher. ''[http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=23250 Brain Strainers - Synopsis]''. [[Allgame]]. Retrieved 13 October 2010.</ref> If the sequence is repeated correctly then the computer generates a longer string of notes to perform.

As the game progresses, the speeds at which the tune is performed and at which the response by the player must be given are increased. Further enhancing the difficulty of the game, the four colored panels cease to light up in higher levels.<ref name=rumburger>Rumburger, B.

===Clef Climber===
"Clef Climber" is a [[Music video game#Pitch games|pitch-based video game]] where the player is given a reference note and then a tone corresponding to a different musical note that must be matched shortly after being played.<ref name=rumburger/> As the game progresses, the reference note ceases to be played and the player must rely on his or her intuitive sense of pitch.<ref name=Brown/> The player can choose whether or not to view the notes on the [[staff (music)|musical staff]],<ref>''[http://www.vgmuseum.com/pics4/brain.html Brain]''. [[Video Game Museum]]. Retrieved 7 December 2008.</ref> however even if musical notes are selected for display, they disappear at higher levels of the game.<ref name=rumburger/>

==Reception==
The game was recognized by ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' magazine for excellence in educational software<ref name=Malnig>Malnig, Anita. ''[http://www.atarimagazines.com/v3n6/educational.html EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE - Antic's Top 18 Picks]''. [[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]. Vol.3, No.6. October 1984. Pg.29.</ref>

''[[Ahoy!]]'' unfavorably reviewed ''Brain Strainers'' for the Commodore 64, stating that it "is a strain all right, but more on patience and interest than gray matter". It praised Clef Climber's graphics but criticized the documentation, which "must have been translated directly from Japanese, and poorly at that! What is the point of Clef Climber? I'm not sure". The magazine liked Finder's Keepers despite the poor graphics and lack of music, but stated that Follow the Leader "left me absolutely speechless. (Other than "idiotic," "pointless," and "ridiculous" for starters.)". It concluded "''Brain Strainers'' is not worth your money, and, most importantly, not worth your kids' time".<ref name="tamis198406">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_06_1984-06_Ion_International_US#page/n89/mode/2up | title=Brain Strainers | work=Ahoy! | date=June 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Tamis, Valerie | pages=90â€“91}}</ref>
