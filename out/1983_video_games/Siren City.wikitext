'''''Siren City''''' is a game for the [[Commodore 64]] which involves the player taking the role of an [[United States|American]] "Cop Car" patrolling the streets of dangerous Siren City. [[Grand Theft Auto]] developer Steve Hammond discusses Siren City as inspiration for Grand Theft Auto as a "top-down car game with cops".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hammon |first=Steve |date=Jan 4, 2021 |title=GTA Origins |url=https://www.stevehammond.org/dmadesign/2021/01/04/Amiga-Addict-Issue2.html |website=stevehammond.org}}</ref>

In the game, Siren City is one of the roughest towns in America. Starting as a rookie driving through a maze of Skyscrapers and seemingly peaceful streets, the player's job is to keep law & order, however the player encounters many of the toughest criminals in the city. These include Public Enemy No. 1: Slit-Throat Steve, Public Enemy No. 7: Dune Buggy Jon and Dr J. Davies Ph.D, V.E.A.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://retrovideogamesystems.com/siren-city/|title = Siren City - Retro Video Game Systems| date=19 September 2013 }}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The game action is displayed via an aerial view of the city centered on the player's "Cop Car". The player undertakes a number of missions, ending after either a set objective achieved or a fixed time duration. These missions include:
* Patrolling the city
* Chasing down criminals in dragsters
* Neutralizing a cloud of chemical smog
* Evading aggressive pursuit by a rogue armed helicopter

The game is distinguished by a large and detailed city map, including high-rise, difficult-to-navigate [[suburb]]s and a working railway line.
