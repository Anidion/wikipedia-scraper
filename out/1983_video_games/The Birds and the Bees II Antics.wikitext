'''''The Birds and the Bees II: Antics''''' is a [[video game]] released for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1983.

Boris the [[Bee]] has been kidnapped by a group of anti-social ants and his cousin Barnabee must rescue him. The player must travel through an underground [[ant]] complex, which has four different entrances into the above-ground world. Ants must be avoided; contact reduces the player's energy level. The game is over when energy reaches zero, but can be replenished by finding pollen from flowers present in the maze.<ref name="mobygames">[http://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/birds-and-the-bees-ii-antics Story information and game overview] at [[MobyGames]]</ref>

The general arrangement of the game is a [[maze]]; flowers will remove barriers elsewhere in the complex. The individual screens are also self-contained mazes. Each screen may have more than one exit.<ref name="mobygames"/>
