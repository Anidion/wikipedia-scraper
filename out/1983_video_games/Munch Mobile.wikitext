'''''Munch Mobile''''' is a top-down driving game released in arcades in 1983. Developed by [[SNK]], it was licensed to [[Centuri]] for the US release. SNK published the game in Japan as '''''Joyful Road'''''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Joyful Road |url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=joyful-road&page=detail&id=1230 |website=Arcade History}}</ref> The player controls an [[anthropomorphic]] car that uses extending arms to grab items from alongside the road. In 1984, [[Texas Instruments]] published a port for its [[TI-99/4A]] home computer.<ref name=vgh/>

==Gameplay==
The game is viewed from a top-down perspective and automatically scrolls forward. The goal is to reach a house at the end of the road and park in the attached garage; the otherwise unseen driver of the car reunites with the occupant of the house.<ref name=vgh>{{cite web|last1=House|first1=TI-99/4A Videogame|title=TI-99/4A Videogame House - Munchmobile|url=http://www.videogamehouse.net/munchmobile.html|website=www.videogamehouse.net|accessdate=24 August 2016}}</ref>

The player drives a car with a large hand attached that is used to collect objects to the left and right of the road.<ref name=klov/> The left 8-way stick steers the car, the right two-way stick controls the hands.<ref name=service/> Fruits, fish, and bags of money give points and gas containers give more fuel. Extra points are awarded for disposing of the inedible remains of food in trash cans.<ref name=klov/> Trees and other obstacles injure the hand, making it temporarily unusable. Lives are lost for running out of fuel or colliding with the side of the road or other cars.<ref name=klov/>
