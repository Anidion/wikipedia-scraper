'''''Kids on Keys''''' is a 1983 [[educational video game]] from [[Spinnaker Software]] designed by Freeda Lekkerkerker.

== Gameplay ==
The game contains three minigames to teach young players basic language and typing skills. In the first, players have to type the correct falling letter before it hits the ground. The second sees the player type the full name of household items before the words reach the bottom of the screen. The third sees names of objects appear at the bottom of the screen, while a series of pictorial icons appear in the center, with the players tasked to press the number on their keyboard that corresponds to that object's icon.

== Development ==
Spinnaker president David Seuss explained that the intention of the program was not to teach typing; rather it was to promote "keyboard familiarity", teaching kids how to reach all the keys and to type faster. Lekkerkerker wanted the game to challenge players who wanted to advance beyond using a joystick while gaming.<ref name=":0"/>

''[[Texas Monthly]]'' thought the game was "imaginative", and a decent rote-learning game, adding that along with ''[[Early Games]]'' it offered a great first computing experience for young gamers.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yisEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Kids+on+Keys%22&pg=RA1-PA200|title=Texas Monthly|date=1984-10-01|publisher=Emmis Communications|language=en}}</ref>
