'''''Halloween''''' is a [[Survival horror|horror]] [[video game]] for the [[Atari 2600]], released in October [[1983 in video gaming|1983]] by [[Wizard Video]]. It is based on the 1978 horror [[Halloween (1978 film)|film of the same name]]. The game was programmed by Tim Martin.<ref name="ign-history">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/30/ign-presents-the-history-of-survival-horror|title=IGN Presents the History of Survival Horror|last=Fahs|first=Travis|work=[[IGN]]|date=2009-10-30|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref> When [[Games by Apollo]] went broke, Martin and another former employee, Robert Barber, developed ''Halloween''.<ref name=Salvo>{{cite web

Although the game was called ''Halloween'', and featured the film's theatrical poster as its cover art as well as the movie's main music theme, the game itself never refers to any characters, including the killer, by their names in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.x-entertainment.com/halloween/2004/october29/|title=Halloween - The Atari Game|publisher=X-Entertainment|date=2004-10-29|access-date=2008-11-10}}{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

In 1983, ''Halloween'' was adapted as a video game for the [[Atari 2600]] by [[Wizard Video]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Perron|first=Bernard|year=2009|title=Horror Video Games: Essays on the Fusion of Fear and Play|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-786-45479-2}}</ref> None of the main characters in the game were named. Players take on the role of a teenage babysitter who tries to save as many children from an unnamed, knife-wielding killer as possible.<ref name=gamed>{{cite web|website=Dread Central|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/231628/9-spooky-horror-atari-2600-games-worth-damn/|access-date=September 8, 2018|author=Bradley-Tschirgi, Mat|date=May 30, 2017|title=9 Spooky Horror Atari 2600 Games That Are Worth a Damn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823204254/https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/231628/9-spooky-horror-atari-2600-games-worth-damn/|archive-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> In another effort to save money, most versions of the game did not even have a label on the cartridge. It was simply a piece of tape with "Halloween" written in marker.<ref>{{cite web|website=That's Not Current|access-date=August 30, 2018|title=Unearthing Wizard Video's Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre Atari Cartridges|date=July 15, 2017|url=http://www.thatsnotcurrent.com/unearthing-wizard-videos-halloween-texas-chainsaw-massacre-atari-cartridges/|author=Panico, Sam|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180908093627/http://www.thatsnotcurrent.com/unearthing-wizard-videos-halloween-texas-chainsaw-massacre-atari-cartridges/|archive-date=September 8, 2018}}</ref> The game contained more gore than the film, however. When the babysitter is killed, her head disappears and is replaced by blood pulsating from the neck as she runs around exaggeratedly. The game's primary similarity to the film is the theme music that plays when the killer appears onscreen.<ref>{{cite web|author=George, Gregory D.|title=History of Horror: A Primer of Horror Games for Your Atari|url=http://www.ataritimes.com/features/horror.html|website=The Atari Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422162459/http://www.ataritimes.com/features/horror.html|archive-date=April 22, 2006|date=October 31, 2001}}</ref>

The player obtains points in two ways: by rescuing children and taking them to "safe rooms" located at both ends of each floor of the house, and by stabbing the killer with the knife (if it can be located). The player advances a level either by rescuing five children or stabbing the killer twice. The killer gets faster with each level increase, and the game continues until all of the player's three lives are lost.

==Controversy and legacy==
Like Wizard Video's other commercial release, ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (video game)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', ''Halloween'' was a controversial title at the time due to its violent content and subject matter. Many game retailers refused to carry the game and the ones who did often kept it behind the counter on a request-only basis.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

''Halloween'', along with ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'', drove Wizard Video Games to bankruptcy.{{Fact|date=October 2018}} While Wizard Video Games were liquidating its merchandise, some copies of the game were shipped and sold without a label, or with a simple white sticker with "HALLOWEEN" hand-written on it to cut costs. This led to even more stores rejecting the game due to its appearance.

''Halloween'' had a slightly better reception than their ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roguecinema.com/article241.html|title=Halloween for the Atari 2600|access-date=2008-07-11|publisher=Rogue Cinema|date=April 1, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130030724/http://roguecinema.com/article241.html|archive-date=November 30, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> although the limited number of copies sold has made both games highly valued items among [[Atari]] collectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/atari2600/action/halloween/index.html|title=''Halloween''|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|access-date=2008-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202024918/http://uk.gamespot.com/atari2600/action/halloween/index.html|archive-date=2009-02-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>
