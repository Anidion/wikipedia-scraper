==Reception==
Bob Proctor reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Geopolitique 1990'' is not only an excellent game, it is an innovative one. It would be nice if it were more detailed (less abstract), it would be nice if you could play either side, it would be VERY nice if there were a two-player version. But I'm not finding fault with what is there; just wishfully thinking of what I'd like to see added to an already full disk."<ref name="CGW14">{{cite magazine |last=Reams |first=Robert |title=Geopolitique 1990: Review |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=February 1984 |volume=1 |issue=14 |pages=31–32, 46}}</ref>
