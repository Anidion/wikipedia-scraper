'''''Super Bunny''''' is a [[platform game]] written by Vic Leone for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] family of home computers and published by [[Datamost]] in 1983.<ref name=giantlist/> Ports to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]]<ref name=amania/> and [[Commodore 64]]<ref name=gb/> followed in 1984.

==Gameplay==

The player starts as a defenseless [[rabbit]], hopping from the left side of the screen to the right on scrolling platforms. The goal is to avoid the creatures that appear on the platforms and reach the [[carrot]] at the right side of the screen. Landing on ("eating") the carrot turns the rabbit into Super Bunny, at which point he must return to the starting position, dispatching creatures and earning points.

The game has a different saying and song for each level (e.g., "crunch those critters" and the song "[[Peter Cottontail (song)|Here Comes Peter Cottontail!]]"). Super Bunny is credited in the game's splash screen as Reginald Rabbit.<ref>{{cite video game
