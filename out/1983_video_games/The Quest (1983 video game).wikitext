'''''The Quest''''' is a graphic [[fantasy]] [[text adventure]] released in 1983 by [[Penguin Software]]. It was designed by Dallas Snell for the [[Apple II]] and was [[ported]] to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[Mac (computer)|Mac]].

==Plot==
The game takes place in a [[medieval fantasy]] setting in the Kingdom of Balema as a [[dragon]] threatens its citizens. The player takes the role of the King's newest adviser and with the help of the King's champion, Gorn, set out to end the dragon menace.

==Gameplay==

The player controls the actions of the party by typing basic commands that are to be issued by the player's character and performed by either the group, Gorn, or your character. The game is played largely by nonlinear exploration and finding important items to allow the player to complete the objective. The player has access to both a text and graphic description of each scene and is able to toggle between strictly text and text/graphic mode.

==Development==
When the game was brought to Penguin Software, some of its content was deemed slightly too mature for publication and was subsequently "toned down" for its release.<ref name="Penguin Software - Adventure Games">{{cite web|url=http://graphicsmagician.com/polarware/adventures.htm|title=Adventure Games|publisher=Polarware Archive site|access-date=July 27, 2017}}</ref>
