'''Orc Attack''' is a [[fixed shooter]] video game written by Dean Lock for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published in 1983 by [[Thorn EMI Computer Software|Thorn EMI]].<ref name=giantlist/> The game was re-released, along with [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] ports, when Thorn rebranded as Creative Sparks, and later at budget price by Sparklers and Top Ten. In ''Orc Attack'', the player protects a castle wall by dropping boulders on ladder climbing [[orc]]s. Though the visuals are low resolution, ''Orc Attack'' has a high level of violence.<ref name=kelly/>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Orc_Attack_Atari_8-bit_PAL_screenshot.png|thumb|left|The player dropped a rock on a ladder with two Orcs (Atari 8-bit).]]

The player moves back and forth along the top of a castle wall, defending it from an orc horde by dropping rocks and pouring boiling oil. Attackers use ladders to scale the wall. Should one of them climb all the way to the ramparts, the player can kill it with a sword, but this diverts attention from the climbing orcs. An evil sorcerer also sends evil spirits against players.
