'''''Dracula''''' is a 1983 video game by [[Imagic]] for the [[Intellivision]]. In the game, a player controls [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] who must attack his victims at night before sunrise and return to his coffin. Along the way, he must avoid enemies such as vultures, wolves and the police.

Contemporary reviews of the game commented on the graphics and gameplay unique to the Intellivision, with some viewers commenting on the level of violence in the game.

==Gameplay==
''Dracula'' can be played as a single-player game, or two players taking turns. In the single-player game, the player takes on the role of [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] as he attempts to bite an allotted amount of victims such as joggers and other neighbours to keep up his strength between midnight and 6:00 am.{{sfn|The Video Game Update|1983a|ref=VGU-Dracula}}  Dracula is moved by the disc controller.{{sfn|Greenberg|1983|pp=69-70}} The player must avoid obstacles such as wolves, vultures and the police. Dracula has the power to turn a police officer into a zombie and attack the other police.{{sfn|The Video Game Update|1983a|ref=VGU-Dracula}} 

In a two-player game, each player can take turns playing as Dracula, or one player can be Dracula while the other is takes on the role of one of his victims.{{sfn|The Video Game Update|1983a|ref=VGU-Dracula}} The second player is awarded points for avoiding Dracula's bite attacks.{{sfn|Greenberg|1983|pp=69-70}}

==Development==
''Dracula'' was a third-party software developed for [[Mattel]]'s [[Intellivision]] video game system. While most games developed for the system were ports of games made for other systems, there were some console exclusive games, including ''Dracula''.{{sfn|Loguidice|2008}} ''Dracula'' was designed by Alan Smith with Wilfredo Aguilar assisting on some graphics.{{sfn|Imagic|1983|ref=manual}}

==Reception==
''Dracula'' was released for the ''Intellivision'' in March 1983 where it was published by Imagic.{{sfn|Weiss|2007|p=220}}{{sfn|The Video Game Update|April 1983|ref=VGU-Rel}}

From contemporary reviews, ''[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]'' gave the game a positive review, noting that the graphics and sound effects were quite good with only the vulture being a bit weak due to it being "a bit blocky."{{sfn|The Video Game Update|1983a|ref=VGU-Dracula}}
Perry Greenberg of ''Video Games'' magazine stated that the game had made Imagic prove "once again that it can make captivating games that make extraordinary use of Intellvisision's graphic capabilities.".{{sfn|Greenberg|1983|pp=69-70}} Michael Blanchet of ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' found the game most fun with the two-player simultaneous mode play mode, noting he found little use for the zombie. Blanchet also complimented the humour in the game noting that the victims "scurrying around in fear, they nonchalantly stroll their merry way, oblivious to the fact that they are about to lose their jugular to some maniac."{{sfn|Blanchet|1983|p=56}} Greenberg wrote that the gameplay was varied enough to sustain interest, but controlling the game was difficult for more sudden and rapid movement.{{sfn|Greenberg|1983|pp=69-70}} Mark Brownstein of ''JoyStik'' gave the game a three-star rating out of five, referring to it as a "so-so game" with limited strategy and occasional rapid reflexes, but was still a unique game for Intellivision.{{sfn|Brownstein|1983}}

Some reviewers commented on the potential violence in the game, with ''The Video Game Update'' and Blanchet noting the game was not as gruesome as it sounded while Brownstein noted that "unless you relish games where you score points for killing people and not just alien spaceships, you may think twice before you buy it."{{sfn|The Video Game Update|1983a|ref=VGU-Dracula}}{{sfn|Greenberg|1983|pp=69-70}}{{sfn|Brownstein|1983}}

In 1984, the editors of ''[[Electronic Games]]'' magazine awarded ''Dracula'' the "Certificate of Merit" in their year-end awards for "Videogame of the Year  (Less than 16K ROM memory)".{{sfn|Electronic Games|1984|ref=EG1984Awards}} From retrospective reviews, Brett Weiss in his book ''Classic Home Video Games 1972-1984'' commented that the gameplay in ''Dracula'' was somewhat repetitive, but found the game worthwhile due to its atmospheric graphics, specifically the detailed backgrounds and the time passage being illustrated through a sky that changes colour.{{sfn|Weiss|2007|p=220}} ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' included ''Dracula'' in their list of top ten games for the Intellivision. The writers of the magazine stated the game was well loved by collectors and noted the games graphics and that "nothing complicated [in ''Dracula''], but what there is is presented brilliantly."{{sfn|Retro Gamer|ref=INTTop10}}
