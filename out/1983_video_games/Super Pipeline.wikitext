'''''Super Pipeline''''' is a puzzle game written by Andy Walker for the [[Commodore 64]] published by Taskset in 1983.<ref name=lemon/> The objective is to keep a series of pipes unblocked so that water may flow through them. It was followed by ''Super Pipeline II'' by the same author in 1985.<ref>{{lemon64 game|id=2551|name=Super Pipeline II}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Enemies include saboteurs that plug up the pipes, bugs that fall from the ceiling to kill the player, and a monster that patrols the pipe in later levels. The player is armed with a gun that can kill bugs, saboteurs, as well as the monster (but only from behind), and is followed by a helper that can remove plugs and kill the smaller bugs. In later levels, a series of walls protect the enemies as they climb the ladder on the right towards the roof. A level ends when a set amount of water enters the barrel at the end of the pipe.<ref name="pipelineGameplay"/>
