==Development==
Paul Norman began working for a small company named Synchro. It was a small software store creating Apple II, VIC-20 and Commodore 64 software. Paul rented a vehicle and drove the 30 miles to apply for an advertised position with a game he had created for the VIC-20. Paul landed the position and began working on ''Forbidden Forest'' as a way of learning 6502 programming. The company that he was working for was going out of business and representatives from the software company Cosmi arrived to purchase office furniture. They saw Paul working on ''Forbidden Forest'' and hired him on the spot.<ref>{{cite web

==Legacy==
A sequel, ''Beyond the Forbidden Forest'', was released in 1985. This was billed as "OmniDimension 4D", as the game is a [[third-person shooter]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=3023|title=Beyond Forbidden Forest|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010101/https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=3023|archive-date=2014-01-01|url-status=dead|website=[[All Media Network#AllGame|AllGame]]}}</ref> that allows the archer to move (and shoot) in and out of the foreground, with scenery changing from day to night in order to represent time passing.<ref>{{cite web

In 1985 [[New Generation Software]] released the [[Commodore 64]] game [[Amazon Warrior]]. Written by [[Geoff Sumner]], the game is a Forbidden Forest clone set in the jungle. Instead of a bow, the main character - the titular amazon warrior - is armed with a [[blowgun]]. Gameplay and controls are almost identical to Forbidden Forest, even though the game quality is lower and the game did not achieve a similar level of praise from gaming magazines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=107|title=Lemon64 - Amazon Warrior}}</ref>
