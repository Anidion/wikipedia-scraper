==Gameplay==
[[Image:FoodFightPlay.png|left|thumb|Charley, between two chefs, attempting to reach the cone on the left A third chef has been hit by food and briefly knocked out of play.]]

In ''Food Fight'', the player controls a boy named Charley Chuck. The object of the game is to eat an [[ice cream cone]] located on the opposite side of an open playfield. The ice cream is slowly melting, and it must be consumed before it melts completely. Controls consist of an analog-position [[joystick]] and a button.

Standing between Charley and the ice cream are four [[chef]]s: Oscar, Angelo, Jacques, and Zorba.<ref name="AH">{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=food-fight&page=detail&id=867|title=Food Fight Video Game|work=ArcadeHistory.com|accessdate=2010-12-06|archive-date=2011-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506072645/http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=food-fight&page=detail&id=867|url-status=live}}</ref> They are identified by the shape of their [[toque]]s: big and round for Oscar, small and rectangular for Angelo, tall and slender for Jacques, and flat and limp for Zorba.<ref name="KLOV"/> The chefs appear from holes in the floor of the level and chase after Charley. The holes serve as respawn points should a chef meet with an accident during the round.

Scattered throughout the screen are piles of food, such as [[pie]]s, [[pea]]s, [[tomato]]es, and [[banana]]s. Both the player and the chefs can grab food from the piles to throw at each other. The player can grab a piece of food by running over a pile, then throw it by aiming the joystick in a chosen direction and pressing the button. The supplies of most foods are limited, but [[watermelon]] is unlimited in supply.<ref name="KLOV"/> Whenever a chef is hit by food thrown by the player or another chef, he is knocked off the screen.<ref name="KLOV"/> The player loses a life if Charley touches a chef, is hit by a chef's thrown food, falls into an open hole, or fails to eat the ice cream before it completely melts.<ref name="KLOV"/>

The player scores points for hitting chefs with thrown food and for luring them into open holes. Eating the cone ends the level, and the player scores bonus points for every unused piece of food (except watermelon) left on the screen.<ref name="AH"/> The point value of the cone increases until level 50, then remains unchanged for the rest of the game.<ref name="AH"/> If Charley is holding a piece of food when he eats the cone, it will carry over to the next level.

Sometimes if the player has at least one close call with a chef and flying food during a level, the game plays back an [[instant replay]] of the entire level while music plays.<ref name="hurd">{{cite web|last1=Stulir|first1=Mike|title=Interview with Jonathan Hurd|url=http://www.classicarcademuseum.org/game-of-the-month/food-fight.htm|website=[[Funspot Family Fun Center#American Classic Arcade Museum|American Classic Arcade Museum]]|access-date=2013-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501030009/http://www.classicarcademuseum.org/game-of-the-month/food-fight.htm|archive-date=2013-05-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Development==
''Food Fight'' was developed by General Computer Corporation (GCC), the company that designed the custom chips of the Atari 7800 and produced [[Midway Games|Midway's]] ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''. Like ''Ms. Pac-Man'', GCC's connection to Atari was born out of accusations of [[copyright infringement]]. The company had produced a kit that would speed up Atari's ''[[Missile Command]]'' arcade machines, but with General Computer claiming the copyright for the modified game.<ref name="AH"/> Fearing for its [[intellectual property rights]], Atari sued GCC for $15 million.<ref name="Gamasutra">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3766/atari_the_golden_years__a_.php?page=16|title=Atari: The Golden Years - A History, 1978-1981|author=Steve Fulton|website=[[Gamasutra]]|date=2008-08-21|accessdate=2010-12-06|archive-date=2010-11-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110090006/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3766/atari_the_golden_years__a_.php?page=16|url-status=live}}</ref> The case was settled out of court, with Atari contracting GCC to produce video games for them, including ''Food Fight'' and ''[[Quantum (video game)|Quantum]]''.<ref name="Gamasutra"/>

In an interview Jonathan Hurd said everyone at GCC contributed to the development. The initials of the people who were most heavily involved in creating ''Food Fight'' are in the high score table.<ref name="hurd"/>

===Bugs===
According to Hurd, the game contains one serious bug, which triggers a reset if the cone is eaten at the last possible moment in a level that is chosen for an instant replay.<ref name="hurd"/> In the Atari 7800 port, it is possible, though rare, for Charley to be hit by food or a chef during the instant replay. When this happens, the game displays "ALMOST MADE IT" and restores the life that was just lost.<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Fight forums|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/food-fight/3030-16876/forums/i-am-overcome-with-shame-473017/|website=[[Giant Bomb]]|date=23 December 2010 |access-date=2016-06-10|archive-date=2018-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920161013/https://www.giantbomb.com/food-fight/3030-16876/forums/i-am-overcome-with-shame-473017/|url-status=live}}</ref>
