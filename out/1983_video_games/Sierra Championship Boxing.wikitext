'''''Sierra Championship Boxing''''' is a [[List of boxing video games|boxing video game]] developed by Evryware and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 1983.<ref name="games_domain" /> Versions were released for [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s (as a [[self-booting disk]]), and [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh]].

==Gameplay==
The player can control the boxer during the rounds or act as [[cornerman]], issuing instructions between rounds. The game also allows for simulated matches with no player input. The player can choose from a roster of real fighters from different eras, or create a boxer with customized abilities.

==Development==
''Sierra Championship Boxing'' was the first PC game Evryware developed. The game was initially going to be published by [[Microsoft]], but  Microsoft decided at the last minute that the home market wasn't big enough yet. Evryware's contact at Microsoft told [[Ken Williams (game developer)|Ken Williams]] at Sierra On-Line about the game; Sierra offered Evryware a contract and published the game in 1983.<ref name="games_domain">{{cite web
