{{Nihongo foot|'''''Donkey Kong 3'''''|ドンキーコング3|'''''Donkī Kongu Surī'''''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[shooter game|shooter]] video game developed and published by [[Nintendo]]. It is the third installment in the [[Donkey Kong|''Donkey Kong'' series]] and it was released for [[Arcade video game|arcades]] worldwide in 1983, the [[Family Computer]] in 1984, then in North America for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1986. The gameplay departs from previous ''Donkey Kong'' games, and it stars an exterminator named Stanley instead of [[Mario]].<ref name="ah">{{cite web |title=Donkey Kong 3 |url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=donkey-kong-3&page=detail&id=667 |website=Arcade History}}</ref>

It was re-released on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in North America on July 14, 2008, and in Europe on January 9, 2009. It was re-released on [[Nintendo Switch]] through [[Nintendo Switch Online]].

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:Dkong3.png|thumb|left|upright=1|Arcade screenshot]]
Donkey Kong hangs from vines at the center of the screen, and the player-controlled Stanley the exterminator runs and jumps on platforms beneath him. Stanley can fire bug spray at both Donkey Kong and insects flying around the levels. A level is completed by continually using his sprayer on Donkey Kong, forcing him to the top of the screen, or by killing all of the bugs. A Super Sprayer can on the vines falls down when Donkey Kong is sprayed past it. The Super Sprayer only lasts for a limited amount of time, but it pushes Donkey Kong upward at a much faster rate, making it easier to complete the level. It only spawns at the start of each life.

The insects consist of Buzzbees, queen Beespies (which shatter into deadly pieces when destroyed), Creepy inchworms, Attacker bees, [[Japanese rhinoceros beetle|Kabutomushi]] beetles, and Butterflies. Some of the flying insects attempt to pick up the flowers at the bottom of the screen and carry them away. Lost flowers decrease the bonus at the end of the round.

There are three levels which repeat in a fixed sequence. An extra life is given at 50,000 points, and then the game goes to "survival of the fittest" mode thereafter.

== Plot ==
Donkey Kong has begun rampaging in Stanley's greenhouse garden and it's up to him to stop the ape from stirring up any more insects that will soon destroy his flowers. Stanley saves the flowers by spraying bug spray on Donkey Kong and exterminating all of the attacking bees.

== Reception ==
The game was moderately successful in Japan, where ''Game Machine'' listed ''Donkey Kong 3'' on their December 1, 1983, issue as being the fourth most-successful new table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型新製品 (New Videos-Table Type)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game shut the :アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 December 1983|page=32|lang=ja}}</ref> Despite this, it was a commercial failure in North America, particularly due to the wake of the [[video game crash of 1983]].

Reviews for the arcade game were generally positive. Gene Lewin of ''[[Play Meter]]'' magazine rated it 8 out of 10.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Lewin |first1=Gene |title=Gene's Judgements: Critiquing AMOA Show Conversions, Dedicated Games |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=January 15, 1984 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=60–2 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-10-number-2-january-15th-1984/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%2010%2C%20Number%202%20-%20January%2015th%201984/page/60/mode/2up}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said that the game's "fast action and superior sound effects" made ''Donkey Kong 3'' a "sure hit" in arcades.<ref name=CVG>"Donkey Kong Swings Back". ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''. February 1984. p. 50.</ref>

Retrospectively, reception has been divisive, with criticism aimed at its departure of its predecessors and the lack of [[Mario]]. [[IGN]] gave the Virtual Console version a 6.0 out of 10, describing it as a "radical departure" from the previous Donkey Kong games, calling it "repetitive".<ref name="IGN Donkey Kong 3 VC review">{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/893/893851p1.html|title=Donkey Kong 3 Review|access-date=August 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813213417/http://wii.ign.com/articles/893/893851p1.html|archive-date=August 13, 2012|url-status=dead|website=[[IGN]]}}</ref>

In 2015, Nathan Birch of ''[[Uproxx]]'' ranked ''Donkey Kong 3'' twentieth on a list of the thirty NES black box titles. Birch called the game "fun enough" but criticized the gameplay as "simple, not-terribly-challenging arcade action", which he felt deviated too far from the gameplay of the game's predecessors. Because of its change to the genre, he thought that the game "killed" the series until its comeback with ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Birch |first=Nathan |date=2015-10-18 |title=Ranking All 30 'Black Box' Nintendo Games In Honor Of The NES' 30th Birthday |url=https://uproxx.com/gaming/30-black-box-nes-games-ranked/ |access-date=2023-10-21 |website=UPROXX |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
[[File:Game&watch-donkey-kong-3.jpg|thumb|Game & Watch ''Donkey Kong 3'']]
A VS. series ''Game & Watch'' version of the arcade game has different gameplay. In this version, player one controls Stanley the Bugman and computer player (or player two) controls Donkey Kong in a duel against each other using exterminating spray cans to move the bees to the other side of them to make the bees sting their opponents. Players can only hold up to three amounts of spraying liquid in their spray cans. On one player mode, the higher player one as Stanley scores, the faster the spraying liquid on the side of computer player as Donkey Kong drops. A version of this game was included in ''[[Game & Watch ports and remakes#Game & Watch Gallery 4|Game & Watch Gallery 4]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]], but featuring Mario in place of Stanley and a Boo and a Fireball in place of the bees.

The NES version of ''Donkey Kong 3'' was released on the [[Wii Virtual Console]], [[3DS Virtual Console]] and [[Wii U Virtual Console]],<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/|title=Nintendo - Official Site - Video Game Consoles, Games|website=www.nintendo.com}}</ref> whilst the arcade version was released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] [[eShop]] as part of [[Hamster Corporation]]'s [[Arcade Archives]] series.

The current world record is held by George Riley (USA) at 3,538,000 points (2011).<ref name="DK3WR">Deaves. Gaz, Gaming Editor.

=== {{Anchor|Donkey Kong 3: The Great Counterattack}} Semi-sequel ===
In 1984, [[Hudson Soft]] developed a semi-sequel for the Japanese-only [[NEC PC-8801]], [[NEC PC-6601]], and [[Sharp X1]] personal computers titled {{Nihongo foot|''Donkey Kong 3: The Great Counterattack''.|ドンキーコング3 大逆襲|Donkī Kongu Surī Dai Gyakushū|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}<ref name="Sharp X1 version">{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/you-can-finally-play-a-long-lost-donkey-kong-game-1823308987|title=You Can Finally Play A Long-Lost Donkey Kong Game|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=February 25, 2018}}</ref> A version for the [[FM-7]] was also planned, but was never released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fm-7.com/museum/softhouse/hudsonsoft/500790300.html|title=Oh!FM-7：ドンキーコング3 大逆襲（ハドソンソフト）|website=www.fm-7.com|language=ja}}</ref> This game is significantly different from the original. While the object to shoot Donkey Kong up in the air remains, it has 20 outdoor backgrounds such as a bridge, Planet Saturn, a desert, a pyramid, and a highway. Stanley can only move from left to right and is no longer able to jump.

For decades, ''Donkey Kong 3: The Great Counterattack'' was inaccessible outside of Japan. In December 2017, a copy of the Sharp X1 version was bought at a [[Yahoo! Auctions]] online auction.<ref name="Sharp X1 version"/> Two months later, it was made available via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]].<ref name="Sharp X1 version"/> The PC-8801 version was subsequently uncovered in January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/2019/02/donkey-kong-3-dai-gyakushuu-pc-8801/|title=Donkey Kong 3: Dai Gyakushuu (PC-8801)|website=www.gamingalexandria.com}}</ref>
