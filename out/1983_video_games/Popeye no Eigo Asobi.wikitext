{{nihongo foot|'''''Popeye no Eigo Asobi'''''|ポパイの英語遊び|Popai no Eigo Asobi|{{lit.}} '''''Popeye's English Fun'''''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} ([[English language|English]]: '''''Popeye's English Fun''''') is a 1983 [[edutainment]] [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Popeye no Eigo Asobi for NES (1983) |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/popeye-no-eigo-asobi |access-date=2022-03-14 |website=MobyGames}}</ref> The game was based on [[Popeye (comic strip)|the comic strip of same name]] created by [[E. C. Segar]] and licensed from [[King Features Entertainment]]. It is a spin-off of the [[Popeye (arcade game)|''Popeye'' arcade game]] made by Nintendo. It was released exclusively in [[Japan]]. It was followed by the similar ''[[Donkey Kong Jr. Math]]'', which was released about one month later. This game was never released in [[North America]] because of the majority of English speakers in the United States and Canada and a corresponding version that would teach players [[Japanese language|Japanese]] was not created due to the technical limitations of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] along with the lack of popularity in the West to learn Japanese aside from cultural or business purposes in the 1980s.

==Gameplay==
In the game, [[Popeye]] teaches players how to spell [[English language|English]] [[word]]s.<ref>{{cite web |date=2006-02-07 |title=Amateur game review |url=http://xgreview.blogspot.com/2006/02/popeye-no-eigo-asobi-112283.html |publisher=Xaqar |accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref> The layout is similar to the ''Popeye'' arcade game, except that players cannot "die", they can only get incorrect answers. The game includes three modes: Word Puzzle A, Word Puzzle B, and Word Catcher.<ref name="NinDB"/> In Word Puzzle A (based on the first level of the original game), the player is given the Japanese term for a word in one of six categories: [[Animal]], [[Country]], [[Food]], [[Sport]]s, [[Science]], and Others (due to technical limitations, these terms are displayed entirely as [[katakana]], regardless of their origin).<ref name="NinDB"/> Blank squares for the English word are given, and the player must maneuver Popeye around to point to [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]s of the [[alphabet]] in order to fill in the blanks. Each wrong letter entry prompts [[Bluto|Brutus/Bluto]] to punch a [[basket]] carrying [[Swee'Pea]]; the player must solve the puzzle before Swee'Pea's basket is knocked off the platform it is attached to.

The player may also forfeit the puzzle by punching the "?" icon. If the puzzle is lost or forfeited, the correct English word will be displayed. Word Puzzle B is identical to the "A" mode; however, the player is not given the Japanese term beforehand. In the two-player ''Word Catcher'' mode (based on the third level of the original game), the first player controls Popeye and the second controls Bluto. Three Japanese words are displayed on the screen's left side, and both players compete to collect letters thrown by [[Olive Oyl]] to spell out their English equivalents. A player wins when he or she has correctly spelled five words.<ref name="NinDB">{{cite web|title='Popeye's English Game'|url=http://www.nindb.net/game/popeyes-english-game.html|accessdate=2009-05-19|work=NinDB|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619113323/http://nindb.net/game/popeyes-english-game.html|archivedate=2010-06-19}}</ref>
