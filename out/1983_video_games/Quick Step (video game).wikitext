== Reception ==

A review in the December 1983 issue of ''Video and Computer Gaming Illustrated'' was mixed, being critical of the graphics and having a mixed reaction to the gameplay.<ref name="Meade1983" /> ''Video Games Magazine'' was also critical of the graphics, but praised the game as "a truly different game, if only because of the potpourri of elements".<ref name="Sittnick1984" /> [[Computer Entertainer]] praised the two-player mode, calling it a "gem".<ref name="Entertainer1983" /> The ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] ''called ''Quick Step'' "closer to a miss than a hit".<ref name="Hudson1984">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/638531619/?match=1&terms=%22quick%20step%22%20atari |title=Gyruss will be enjoyed, in some circles |newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |last=Hudson |first=Lou |date=30 June 1984 |access-date=22 May 2024}}</ref>

In a retrospective review of Imagic games, [[IGN]] said ''Quick Step'' "is a brilliant, furious multiplayer game for a system not exactly known for aggressive two-player action games", putting it in their top five list of Imagic games for the Atari 2600.<ref name="Buchanan2009" />
