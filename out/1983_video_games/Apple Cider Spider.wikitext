'''''Apple Cider Spider''''' is a three-screen [[platform game]] written for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] by Ivan Strand and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 1983.<ref name="giantlist"/> A [[Commodore 64]] port followed.<ref>{{Lemon64 game|id=125|name=Apple Cider Spider}} 
</ref> The player takes the role of a [[spider]] in an [[apple cider]] factory. The goal is to progress through three screens to reach the top of the factory, to join the company of other spiders.

The structure of the three screens follows the production cycle of apple cider in a reverse order, starting from the bottling and sealing of cider and ending at the delivery of fresh whole apples. The first screen mainly concerns extracting the apple [[juice]] to be made into cider, the second screen concerns splitting the apples in two and crushing the halves, and the third screen concerns the actual import of the apples. Each screen is situated on top of the previous one, so the spider progresses upward while the apples are carried downward.

The challenge in the game comes almost completely in the form of natural obstacles in the cider factory. Contact with cider, apples, or cider-making instruments kills the spider instantly. All three screens feature a complex system of [[conveyor belt]]s that the spider must travel along, in the opposite direction to the cider and the apples. Various cider-making instruments operate periodically to make the apples into cider. The factory is oblivious to the presence of the spider.

When the three screens have been completed, the game starts again, but with added dangers. These include various [[animal]]s that hop along the platform as well as blocker bars on the [[ladder]]s that the spider uses to move upwards.
