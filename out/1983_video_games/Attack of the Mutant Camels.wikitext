'''''Attack of the Mutant Camels''''' is a [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[video game]] written by [[Jeff Minter]] and released for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Atari 8-bit computers]] in 1983 by Minter's [[Llamasoft]]. The horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] is similar to the [[Atari 2600]] game ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1982 video game)|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1982), with [[AT-AT]] walkers replaced by giant camels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://llamasoftarchive.org/8bitgames/attack-of-the-mutant-camels/|title = Attack of the Mutant Camels â€“ Llamasoft Baachive}}</ref> Confusingly, a very different game from Jeff Minter's ''[[Gridrunner]]'' series was also released in the US under the name ''Attack of the Mutant Camels''.

Llamasoft released a sequel, ''[[Revenge of the Mutant Camels]]'', in 1984.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a small jet plane and has the task of killing giant yellow [[camel]]s before they reach the home base. Doing so requires several dozens of shots. The camels retaliate by shooting fireballs from their mouths. If a camel reaches the base, the game is lost. Once all camels on a level are killed, the player has to survive a "hyperspace" sequence which requires avoiding high-speed missiles. Upon successful completion, the next level presents a new wave of camels, with slightly harder gameplay.

==Legacy==
In 2011, ''Attack of the Mutant Camels'' was chosen to be featured in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "[[The Art of Video Games]]" exhibit.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/winninggames.pdf | title = The Art of Video Games Exhibition Checklist | accessdate = 2011-05-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110523075002/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/winninggames.pdf| archivedate= 23 May 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>
