==Gameplay==
The game starts with the legend that the Sultan was visiting [[Hampton Court]] and was robbed of his [[gemstone|jewels]] while in the [[maze]]. His [[bodyguard]] tried to recover them but was murdered by the group of [[theft|thieves]]. In the present day setting of the game, the player must enter the maze and recover the jewels bringing them back outside. Aside from making it through the maze without getting lost or tired the player must also be on the look out for the ghost of the Sultan's bodyguard.<ref name=":0" />
