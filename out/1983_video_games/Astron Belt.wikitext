'''''Astron Belt''''' (アストロンベルト) is a [[LaserDisc video game]] in the form of a third-person, [[Space combat game|space combat]] [[rail shooter]], released in [[Arcade video game|arcades]] in 1983 by [[Sega]] in [[Japan]], and licensed to [[Bally Midway]] for release in North America.<ref name="AtariHQ">{{cite web|title=ASTRON BELT|publisher=Atari HQ|url=http://www.atarihq.com/coinops/laser/astbelt.html|accessdate=2011-03-25| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110320215956/http://www.atarihq.com/coinops/laser/astbelt.html| archive-date= 20 March 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="allgame">{{cite web|url=https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9550|title=Astron Belt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010101/https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9550|archive-date=2014-01-01|url-status=dead|website=[[All Media Network#AllGame|AllGame]]}}</ref> Developed in 1982,<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Sega: From Service Games to Master Systems|author=Mark Isaacson|year=2002|url=http://www.mobygames.com/featured_article/feature,16/section,93/|accessdate=2011-03-25|archive-date=2019-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191104130540/https://www.mobygames.com/featured_article/feature,16/section,93/|url-status=dead}}</ref> it was the first major arcade laserdisc video game.<ref name="AtariHQ"/><ref name="allgame"/> The game combines [[full-motion video]] (FMV) footage from the laserdisc with [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] [[2D graphics]]. The arcade game was available in both upright and cockpit [[arcade cabinet]]s, with the latter having illuminated buttons on the control panel, a larger 25" monitor (the upright used a standard 19"), and a [[force feedback]] vibrating seat.

The game was first unveiled at the 20th [[Amusement Machine Show]], held in [[Tokyo]] during September 1982, and then at [[Chicago]]'s Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) show, held during November 18–20, 1982.<ref name="GM211">{{cite magazine|title=Overseas Readers Column: Sega's Astron Belt Will Be Shipped Soon|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=211|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 May 1983|page=30|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830501p.pdf#page=16}}</ref><ref name="VideoGames"/> This marked the beginning of laserdisc fever in the video game industry,<ref name="AtariHQ"/> and released in Japan during early 1983, with Sega projecting to ship 10,000 cabinets that year.<ref name="GM211"/> It was subsequently released in Europe, where it was the first laserdisc game released in the region.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Looks at Lasers: The Shape of Games to Come |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 November 1983 |issue=26 (December 1983) |pages=86–7 |url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/183/501/astron_belt_review.html |accessdate=2018-01-05}}</ref> However, Bally Midway delayed the game's release in the United States to fix several hardware and software bugs, by which time it had been beaten to public release by several laserdisc games including ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]''.<ref name="AtariHQ"/>

The game was a commercial success in arcades, especially in Japan where it was the top-grossing upright/cockpit arcade game for four months. Critical reception was initially positive following its AMOA 1982 debut and then its European release, but was later mixed following its North American release as it drew unfavorable comparisons with other laserdisc games. ''Astron Belt'' was ported to the [[MSX]] home system in 1984 in [[Japan]].

==Gameplay==
The player controls a lone spacecraft on a mission to singlehandedly take down the entire enemy armada. Enemy fighters and ships shoot at the player, and there are mines and other objects that must be shot or avoided.

The game is divided into waves. At the end of each wave is a command ship that must be destroyed. In later waves the enemy fighters move and shoot more aggressively, and their shots are more accurate. Some waves take place in open space, while others require the player to battle enemies while flying through narrow trenches and tunnels. The player is on a timer at the beginning of the game, with an unlimited number of lives available. The length of the timer can be adjusted by the machine operator, but is normally 60 seconds. After the timer expires, the player is given a limited number of additional lives. When all of those lives are lost, the game ends.

The background videos used in the game are a mixture of original artwork and borrowed material. In addition to the scenes created specifically for the game, the designers also incorporated footage from three [[science fiction]] movies: ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'', and ''[[Message from Space]]''.

[[File:Sega Astron Belt.jpg|thumb|An ''Astron Belt'' laserdisc]]

''Astron Belt'' initially used a [[Pioneer (company)|Pioneer]] laserdisc player.<ref name="GM211"/> In total, it used one of four laserdisc players, either a Pioneer LD-V1000 or LD-V1001, or a [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] VIP-9500SG or VIP-9550. Two different versions of the laser disc itself were also pressed, a single-sided version by Pioneer and a double-sided version by Sega. However, both discs have the same information and may be used in any of the four players.

Running on the [[Sega Laserdisc]] hardware, the game combines [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] laserdisc footage with a [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] [[2D computer graphics]] plane. The real-time graphics plane generates sprite graphics similar to an earlier Sega title, ''[[Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom]]'' (1982),<ref name="CVG"/> and was overlaid by imitating a [[Matte (filmmaking)|matting]] technique. As the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor [[Scan line|scans]] horizontally across the screen, it is fed information from the laserdisc up until the point where it is fed information from the [[computer graphics]] system, after which information coming from the laserdisc stops, creating a black mask into which a [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] is inserted. It uses a [[collision detection]] system where both the laserdisc and sprite planes can interact with each other. Each frame of the laserdisc footage is coded with a hit detection spot stored in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] [[Computer memory|memory]]. The [[Zilog Z80]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] reads the number of the laserdisc frame, and checks the laserdisc hit spots with the shots fired by the player, and if the coordinates correspond, it instructs the laserdisc player to display an explosion sequence. For sections where the player must navigate between walls, the walls in the laserdisc footage are also coded and use collision detection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragons-lair-project.com/community/related/articles/allgames/pic4.gif|format=GIF|title=Photographic image of book page|website=Dragons-lair-project.com|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref>

===Reviews===
''Video Games'' gave the arcade game a highly positive review following its AMOA 1982 demonstration, calling it a "large screen science fiction space shooting game that's played against ''film footage'' of spaceships, planets and explosions!" They stated that, for "''many'' players, this is the ''ultimate'' video game!"<ref name="VideoGames">{{cite magazine | magazine = Video Games| volume = 1 | publisher = Pumpkin Press | issue = 7 | page = 66 | title = Top Ten Hits | date=March 1983 | url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_06_1983-03_Pumpkin_Press_US#page/n65/mode/2up}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave it a positive review upon its European release, calling it a pioneering game and praising the realistic visuals and audio, the [[Continue (video games)|continue]] feature, the futuristic cockpit cabinet, and the vibrating seat, but criticizing "a few rough edges" in the gameplay, the high price of {{£|0.40|long=no|1983}} per play, and for sometimes vibrating "more than is comfortable." They concluded that "any arcade player who wants a future in gaming should try his hand at Astron Belt as soon as possible" but "it remains to be seen if Astron Belt is the shape of games to come."<ref name="CVG">''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', issue 22 (August 1983), [http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/179/501/astron_belt_review.html page 30] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103730/http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/179/501/astron_belt_review.html |date=2015-09-24 }}, published 16 July 1983</ref>

Upon its North American release, the game received mixed reviews from ''Computer Games'' magazine, comparing it unfavorably with other laserdisc games. One of the two reviewers was game designer [[Eugene Jarvis]], who criticized the collision detection and the lack of realistic gameplay or direction, but he praised the "sense of power" and "macho feel" it gives, particularly with the explosions.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Bloom |first1=Steve |title=The Lasers Have Landed!

==Legacy==
''Astron Belt'' was responsible for starting the LaserDisc [[interactive movie]] craze when it was shown at the 1982 AMOA show. One of the games it inspired was ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'' (1983).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XiM0ntMybNwC&pg=PA128 |title=The Video Game Explosion: A History from PONG to Playstation and Beyond - Mark J.

Sega introduced a sequel, ''Star Blazer'', at Tokyo's [[Amusement Machine Show]] (AM Show) in September 1983. It was unanimously hailed as the "strongest" LaserDisc game of the show.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Somber" JAMMA Show Hosts Five Laser Disc Games |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=October 15, 1983 |pages=32, 34 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/80s/1983/CB-1983-10-15.PDF#page=45}}</ref> Bally Midway distributed it as ''Galaxy Ranger'' in North America in 1984. It had the same controls and very similar gameplay to ''Astron Belt'', and one machine could be converted to the other by simply changing the LaserDisc, game [[Read-only memory|ROMs]], and sound board.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Starblazer'' on their January 15, 1984 issue as being the third most-successful upright arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=228|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 January 1984|page=31|lang=ja}}</ref>
