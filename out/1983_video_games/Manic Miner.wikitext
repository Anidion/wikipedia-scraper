'''''Manic Miner''''' is a [[platform game]] written for the [[ZX Spectrum]] by [[Matthew Smith (games programmer)|Matthew Smith]]. It was published by [[Bug-Byte]] in 1983, then later the same year by [[Software Projects]].<ref name='pcw_ms'>{{cite magazine|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2800&page=12|volume=3|issue=14|page=12|magazine=[[Popular Computing Weekly]]|date=April 1984|author=Graham Taylor|access-date=17 February 2023|title=And pigs will fly...

==Gameplay==
[[File:Manic Miner Screenshot.png|thumb|left|The first room: "Central Cavern"]]
In each of the twenty caverns, each one screen in size, are several flashing objects, which the player must collect before Willy's oxygen supply runs out. Once the player has collected the objects in one cavern, they must then go to the now-flashing portal, which will take them to the next cavern. The player must avoid enemies, listed in the cassette inlay as ''"...Poisonous Pansies, Spiders, Slime, and worst of all, Manic Mining Robots..."'' which move along predefined paths at constant speeds. Willy can also be killed by falling too far, so players must time the precision of jumps and other movements to prevent such falls or collisions with the enemies.

Extra lives are gained every 10,000 points, and the game ends when the player has no lives left. Above the final portal is a garden. To the right is a house with a white picket fence and red car parked in front. To the left is a slope leading to backyard with a pond and tree; a white animal, resembling a cat or mouse, watches the sun set behind the pond. Upon gaining his freedom, the game restarts from the first level with no increase in difficulty.

The in-game music is ''[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]''<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/retro-gamer/20210121/281668257620123|title=|via=PressReader|accessdate=13 December 2023}}</ref> from [[Edvard Grieg|Edvard Grieg's]] music to [[Henrik Ibsen|Henrik Ibsen's]] play ''[[Peer Gynt]]''. The music that plays during the title screen is an arrangement of ''[[The Blue Danube]]''.

==Release==
[[File:ManicMinerLoadingScreen.gif|thumb|Animated loading screen]]
There are some differences between the Bug-Byte and Software Projects versions:

# In "Processing Plant", the enemy at the end of the conveyor belt is a bush in the original, whereas the Software Projects one resembles a [[Pac-Man]] ghost.
# In "Amoebatrons' Revenge", the original Bug-Byte amoebatrons look like alien octopuses with tentacles hanging down, whereas the Software Projects amoebatrons resemble the Bug-Byte logo.
# In "The Warehouse", the original game has threshers travelling up and down the vertical slots, rotating about the screen's X-axis. The Software Projects version has [[Penrose triangle]]s (i.e. the Software Projects logo) instead,<ref name="auto"/> which rotate about the screen's [[Z-axis]].
# The Bug-Byte cheat code was the numerical sequence "''6031769''", based on Matthew Smith's driving licence.<ref>Retro Gamer Magazine issue 48 - Interview with Matthew Smith</ref> In the Software Projects version this changed to "''typewriter''".<ref>Smith would later use the code "''writetyper''" to activate the cheat mode for ''Jet Set Willy''.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Jsw/mmengine.html|title=Page moved|website=www.seasip.demon.co.uk}}</ref>

==Ports==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=January 2023}}
The game was officially ported to the [[Commodore 64]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/manic-miner/|title=Manic Miner &#124; Retro Gamer|first1=© Future Publishing Limited Quay|last1=House|first2=The|last2=Ambury|first3=Bath BA1 1UA All rights reserved|last3=Engl|first4=Wales company registration|last4=number 2008885|website=www.retrogamer.net|date=16 September 2009}}</ref> [[Commodore 16]], [[Amstrad CPC]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/|title=GamesRadar+|website=gamesradar}}</ref> [[BBC Micro]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=188|title = Manic Miner}}</ref> [[Dragon 32/64]], [[Amiga]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://amigareviews.leveluphost.com/manicmin.htm#manicmineraf|title = Amiga Reviews: Manic Miner}}</ref> [[Oric 1]], [[Game Boy Advance]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1795707.stm|title=Updated Manic Miner to return|date=February 1, 2002|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> [[MSX]], [[SAM Coupé]], and [[mobile phone]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matica.com/mobile_Phone_Java_Game.php?gameID=4 |title=Mobile phone java game for download |publisher=Matica.com |date=2007-07-13 |access-date=2011-03-28}}</ref>

===SAM Coupé===
[[File:SAM Coupé Manic Miner.png|right|thumb|SAM Coupé version (1992)]]
The [[SAM Coupé]] version, programmed by Matthew Holt, like the ZX original requires pixel-perfect timing, and both graphics and audio, the latter by [[František Fuka]], were greatly updated. In addition to the original twenty caverns, forty additional caverns were included in this release. Levels were designed by David Ledbury, and winners of a competition run by SAM Computers Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofsam.org/node/57 |title=Manic Miner|publisher = World of Sam |access-date=2013-09-29}}</ref>

===PMD 85===
The game was ported for Czechoslovak Computers [[PMD 85]] in 1985. The authors of the PMD 85 version are Vít Libovický and Daniel Jenne. They made it as accurate as they could.<ref name="mm orig">{{cite web|title=Manic Miner Original|url=http://pmd85.borik.net/wiki/Manic_Miner_original|website=PMD85.Borik.net}}</ref>

===BBC Micro===
The [[BBC Micro]] version does not have the Solar Power Generator, instead containing a completely different room called "The Meteor Shower". This has the "reflecting machines" from the Solar Power Generator, but there is no beam of light. Instead, it has meteors which descend from the top of the screen and disintegrate when they hit platforms, like the Skylabs in Skylab Landing Bay. It also has forcefields which turn on and off, and the layout is completely different.

Also, the last screen (which is still called "The Final Barrier") is complex and difficult (unlike the Spectrum version, which is considered to be fairly easy) and has a completely different layout. It also features the blinking forcefields.

===Amstrad CPC===
The [[Amstrad CPC|Amstrad]] version was effectively the same as the Spectrum version by Software Projects, except that Eugene's Lair was renamed "Eugene Was Here", and the layout of "The Final Barrier" was again completely different (but is more similar to the Spectrum version than the BBC version).

===Dragon 32/64===
[[File:Dragon Manic Miner.gif|right|thumb|Dragon version of ''Manic Miner'' (1984)]]
The [[Dragon 32]] version, programmed by Roy Coates, had two extra rooms (i.e. 22 altogether) and a cheat mode accessed by typing "P", "P", "ENGUIN". To retain the resolution of the original, the Dragon version used PMODE 4 in black/white mode.<ref>{{cite web

===Oric/Atmos===
Programmed by Chris Larkin, the [[Oric computers|Oric]] version has 32 screens instead of 20.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jswmm.co.uk/topic/257-oric-version/|title=Oric Version|website=Jet Set Willy And Manic Miner Community|date=8 January 2017}}</ref>

===Commodore 16===
The [[Commodore 16]] version was limited in a number of respects - this was mainly due to the initial lack of developer material for the C16 machine, and a two-week deadline to produce and test the game, then generate a master tape for the duplication house. Other issues were the lack of a [[fast loader]] system for the C16 cassette deck, and as a result it took about seven minutes for the game to load, and a bug resulted in the game entering the first screen as soon as the tape had finished loading instead of waiting for the user to start the game. Further issues related to the lack of music and in game sound, and the way that video memory was mapped in the C16, this resulted in a number of the screens having to be removed so that load time and video mapping could be correctly handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jswmm.co.uk/topic/58-c16-version/|title=C16 Version - MM|website=Jet Set Willy And Manic Miner Community|date=2 March 2015}}</ref>
