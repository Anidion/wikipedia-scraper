'''''Aztarac''''' is a  scrolling [[multidirectional shooter]] with color [[vector graphics]]. It was developed by [[Tim Stryker]] (1954–1996) and released in arcades by [[Centuri]] in 1983. The player commands an intergalactic race of [[mutant]] [[human]]s whose mode of transport is a [[tank]]. Its turret is independently controlled, allowing the player to move in one direction while shooting in another. The mission is to guard [[space station|space outposts]] from hordes of incoming enemy [[spacecraft|ship]]s. ''Aztarac''{{'s}} color vector graphics were impressive at the time of release, and a circular plastic lens over the screen accentuates the visuals. Few machines were produced, though the exact number is unclear. Centuri only developed two vector games; ''Aztarac'' was the second.<ref name=ah/>

==Gameplay==

Four outposts are located in the center of a scrolling playfield, and the player must protect them from waves of enemy attackers. A flight-style joystick moves the player's tank; a trigger on the joystick shoots; a separate knob rotates the tank's turret independently of movement; and a button activates a scanner which shows where offscreen enemies are.{{clear}}

==Reception==
According to Tony Temple of ''The Arcade Blogger'', ''Aztarac'' was an obscure release:

{{quote|But despite the stunning visuals (for the time at least), the game was not a commercial success at all. There are various estimates of the number of Aztaracs actually built – many put the figure at 500, but based on Centuri’s 1983 annual report, it seems that perhaps less than 200 is a more likely figure.<ref name=temple/>}}

==Legacy==
One of the few ''Aztarac'' machines still in existence was discovered and restored in 2016. It turned out to be the one originally owned by the game's creator, Tim Stryker.<ref name=temple/>

Dennis Bartlett of [[Iowa]], USA, scored a [[world record]] 142,390 points on Aztarac on February 11, 1984.<ref>{{ cite web|url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&pi=2&gi=617&vi=649 |title=Twin Galaxies' Aztarac High Score Rankings |accessdate=27 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102131856/http://twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22 |archivedate=2 January 2010 }}</ref><!-- Note: Guiness World Records source their Arcade world records scores from Twin Galaxies -->
