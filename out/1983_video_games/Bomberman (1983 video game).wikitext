==Gameplay==
[[Image:Bomberman (NES) gameplay.png|256px|left|thumb|Bomberman in action on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]]]
In the NES/Famicom release, the [[eponym]]ous character, [[Bomberman#Characters|Bomberman]], is a robot that must find his way through a maze while avoiding or destroying enemies. He can set bombs to attack enemies and destroy rocks that block his path; initially, the bombs explode after a short delay. Doors leading to further maze rooms are hidden under rocks, as are power-up items that grant abilities such as placing multiple bombs at once, increasing their blast radius, and being able to set them off at any desired moment.

Bomberman will turn human when he escapes and reaches the surface. Each game has 50 levels in total. The original home computer games are more basic and have some different rules. Notably, completing the NES and Famicom version reveals that the game is a [[prequel]] to Hudson Soft's NES port of [[Broderbund|Broderbund Software]]'s 1983 game ''[[Lode Runner]]''. Upon clearing the final screen, Bomberman is shown turning into Lode Runner's unnamed protagonist. In the Japanese version of the game, the player is explicitly told that Bomberman will 'See [them] in ''Lode Runner''', while in the international version, they are instead asked if they can recognise the protagonist from another Hudson game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tcrf.net/Bomberman_(NES)#Version_Differences|title=Bomberman (NES) - The Cutting Room Floor|website=tcrf.net}}</ref>

==Development==
''Bomberman'' was written in 1980 to serve as a [[technology demonstration|tech demo]] for [[Hudson Soft]]'s [[BASIC]] compiler.<ref name="NGen3">{{cite journal|title=Hudson Soft |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|pages=78–81}}</ref> This very basic version of the game was given a small-scale release for Japanese PCs in 1983 and the European PCs the following year.<ref name="NGen3"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/eric-and-the-floaters/release-info|title = Eric and the Floaters (1983) release dates}}</ref>
The Famicom version was developed (ported) by Shinichi Nakamoto,<ref>『Super Bomberman Official Guidebook (スーパーボンバーマン 公式ガイドブック(小学館))』 (only in Japan) pp.104-105</ref> who reputedly completed the task alone over a 72 hour period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5739680/marathon-programming-session-resulted-in-smash-hit-game |title=Marathon Programming Session Resulted in Smash Hit Game |date=January 21, 2011 |publisher=Kotaku.com |access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref>
According to ''[[Zero (video game magazine)|Zero]]'' magazine, ''Bomberman'' adopted gameplay elements from the [[Coreland]]/[[Sega]] arcade hit ''[[Pengo (video game)|Pengo]]'' (1982).<ref name="Zero">{{cite magazine |last1=Stokes |first1=Doris |title=Dosh Eaters |magazine=[[Zero (video game magazine)|Zero]] |date=December 1991 |issue=26 |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=91–92 |url=https://archive.org/details/zero-magazine-26/page/n90}}</ref>

The European home computer versions were released as ''Eric and the Floaters'' to avoid any association with a series of terrorist bombings carried out by the [[Irish Republican Army]] during [[The Troubles]].<ref name="troubles">{{Cite book |last=Hawken |first=Kieren |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBWMDwAAQBAJ&q=Eric%2520and%2520the%2520Floaters%2520ira&pg=PT38 |title=The A-Z of MSX Games: Volume 1 |date=2019-02-27 |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |isbn=978-1-78982-059-1 |language=en}}</ref>

==Enhanced ports and re-releases==
''Bomberman'' is most known for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version released in Japan on December 19, 1985 and in North America in January 1989. Hudson Soft's director of [[research and development]], Shinichi Nakamoto, commented in a 1995 interview that "I personally believe that the Famicom version of ''Bomberman'' is the one and only version of the game."<ref name="NGen3"/> This version was ported back to the MSX the following year as ''Bomberman Special''. Bomberman's appearance in this game ([[Hudson Soft]] re-used an enemy graphic taken from their own 1984 NES/Famicom port of [[Broderbund]]'s ''[[Lode Runner]]'') is an early version of Bomberman's more famous design, a robotic anime-like character with a pink antenna. The game was also released on [[Game Boy]] as a "Game B" mode of the game ''[[Atomic Punk]]''. In 2004, this version of ''Bomberman'' was re-released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as part of the Famicom Mini series in Japan and the [[Classic NES Series]] in North America and Europe. It was released in the same year for the [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]].

A remake/update was released for the PlayStation, titled ''Bomberman'' in Japan and Europe, and renamed ''[[Bomberman Party Edition]]'' in North America. This release features a port of the original version of the single-player game as well as a revised and updated version with pre-rendered 3D graphics and contemporary audio. The updated graphics and audio were also used for the multiplayer aspect of the game.
