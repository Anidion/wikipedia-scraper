==Gameplay==

''Pitstop'' is played from a semi-first-person perspective, placing the player in a bird's-eye perspective slightly behind a race car. The game features three difficulty modes and three gameplay modes: Single, Mini-Circuit, and Grand Circuit. In Single, the player can choose from one of six tracks and learn how to play the game. In the game's Circuit modes, the player races against other drivers and earns a certain number of points and money depending on the place he finishes in each race. The Mini-Circuit features only three tracks, while the Grand Circuit features all six.<ref name=AG64/><ref name=manual/><ref name=CC/>

''Pitstop'' implements [[pit stop]]s, a concept not featured in many other contemporary racing video games.<ref name=C64HC/><ref name=HiR/><ref name=Compute/> Color-based damage is shown on the player's car whenever it hits another vehicle or a wall on the track, both of which wear out the tires. The player also has a fuel meter that gradually depletes during each race. If the player's vehicle displays a red color from taking too much damage, or if it is running low on fuel, it must make a pit stop. Unlike other racing video games, the pit crew is fully controlled by the player, who must refuel the vehicle and replace its worn-out tires. Up to four players can play by taking alternating turns.<ref name=AG64>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=4378 |title=Pitstop – Overview (Commodore 64)|last=House|first=Matthew|work=AllGame|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141115152629/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=4378|archive-date=November 15, 2014|access-date=August 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=manual>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Pitstop_1983_Epyx#page/n0/mode/2up|title=Pitstop instruction manual|publisher=Epyx|year=1983|access-date=August 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=CC>{{cite web|url= https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1984-04/Creative_Computing_v10_n04_1984_Apr#page/n126/mode/1up |title=Pistop.

==Reception==
[[File:November 1983 Pitstop advertisement by Epyx.jpg|thumb|Printed advertisement for the game.]]
''The Commodore 64 Home Companion'' noted that the game's pit stop feature "slows the action down, but it adds an element of strategy (Can I make it around again without blowing out that right-front tire?) to what would otherwise be just another eye-hand coordination game."<ref name=C64HC>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/The_Commodore_64_Home_Companion#page/n172/mode/1up|title=Epyx Software|work=The Commodore 64 Home Companion|year=1984|access-date=August 19, 2016|page=171}}</ref> Roy Wagner of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' felt that ''[[Pole Position (video game)|Pole Position]]'' was a superior racing game, and wrote that ''Pitstop'' "is [[wikt:the pits|the pits]] because that is where the race is won or lost."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1985&pub=2&id=24 |title=Get Your Engines Running|last=Wagner|first=Roy|date=November–December 1985|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|access-date=August 24, 2016|page=21}}</ref>

''Computer Fun'' gave the game 2.5 out of 4 and wrote that "fantasy is a fragile thing and the reality of ''Pitstop'' is something less than harrowing, as the driver finds when he braces himself for an outrageous switchback only to find it as tame as a suburban boulevard. Disappointingly, the six 'unforgiving' tracks merely blend into a pureed sameness. Graphically, the cars are done in fine style but the trackside scenery consists of green flatlands and an occasional bush or sign. […] As for gameplay, ''Pitstop'' is at its best in the more difficult settings where things are a little more hectic and the side-to-side motion of the cars add challenge."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-pitstop_6892.html |title=Pitstop review|work=Computer Fun|date=May 1984|access-date=August 19, 2016}}</ref>

Ted Salamone of ''[[Electronic Games]]'' reviewed the Commodore 64 version and wrote, "The engine rev sounds are realistic, the pit screen unforgettable, and the action absolutely hair-raising."<ref name=EG>{{cite web|url= https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_02_Number_14_1984-09_Reese_Communications_US#page/n37/mode/1up|title=Pitstop Stop|last=Salamone|first=Ted|work=[[Electronic Games]]|date=September 1984|access-date=August 19, 2016|page=39}}</ref> Stephen Reed of ''Hi-Res'' wrote that ''Pitstop'' "does not have the extended playability or good graphics" of ''Pole Position''. Reed called the game's pit stop concept a "unique feature", but wrote, "While this is an interesting aspect to the program, its attractiveness is short lived because the pits soon become an obstacle to racing."<ref name=HiR>{{cite web|url= https://archive.org/stream/Hi-Res_Magazine_Issue4/Hi-Res_Magazine_Issue3#page/n67/mode/2up/search/Pitstop|title=Pitstop|last=Reed|first=Stephen|work=Hi-Res|date=May 1984|access-date=August 19, 2016|pages=67{{ndash}}68}}</ref>

Shay Addams of ''[[Compute!]]'' praised the game's "exciting competition and action" and its pit stop feature, writing that the game "requires strategy and split-second decision-making that are missing in other racing games." Addams wrote that ''Pitstop'' was more enjoyable when playing with others, and noted that the game's graphics were not as detailed as ''Pole Position'', but concluded, "Since veteran race car drivers agree that many professional races are won in the pits, not on the track, ''Pitstop'' has to be one of the most realistic and playable racing simulations available."<ref name=Compute>{{cite web|url= https://archive.org/stream/1984-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_048_1984_May#page/n122/mode/1up|title=Pitstop review|last=Addams|first=Shay|work=[[Compute!]]|date=May 1984|access-date=August 19, 2016|page=123 {{ndash}}124}}</ref>
