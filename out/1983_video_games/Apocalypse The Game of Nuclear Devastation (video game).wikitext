}}'''''Apocalypse: The Game of Nuclear Devastation''''' is a video game based on the board game ''[[Apocalypse: The Game of Nuclear Devastation]]'' by [[Games Workshop]].

==Gameplay==
''Apocalypse'' includes nine ways for the player to attack, instead of six like in the board game; the player is also able to use ships in addition to armies and missiles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/home-computing-weekly-012/Home_Computing_Weekly_012#page/n13/mode/2up|title=Home Computing Weekly Magazine Issue 012|website=archive.org}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Computer Answers'' #84 stated that ''Apocalypse'' "is not a game of mindless destruction like so many others, but rather one of tactics and strategy".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Answers_Issue8404#page/n23/mode/2up/search/apocalypse+%22red+shift%22|title=Computer Answers Issue8404|website=archive.org}}</ref> Tony Bridge reviewed ''Apocalypse'' for ''Micro Adventurer'' #7 (May 1984), and described it as "a game system which should keep anyone happy for many months".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/microadventurer-magazine-07/MicroAdventurer_07#page/n37/mode/2up/search/apocalypse+%22red+shift%22|title=MicroAdventurer Magazine Issue 07|website=archive.org}}</ref> Angus Ryall for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' #9 (October 1984), complimented Red Shift as their games ''Apocalypse'' and ''[[Rebelstar Raiders]]'' were at the time "still far and away the best strategy games for the Spectrum".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Crash_No._09_1984-10_Newsfield_GB#page/n77/mode/2up/search/apocalypse+%22red+shift%22|title=Crash - No. 09 (1984-10)(Newsfield)(GB)|website=archive.org|date=October 1984 }}</ref>

Russell Clarke reviewed ''Apocalypse'' for ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' #54, and stated that "''Apocalypse'' is a good rendition of the tried and tested boardgame with some improvements (you buy the nuke instead of miraculously receiving one when you win a battle) and a few problems (speed of operation being the most serious). The BBC version offers the best value, I feel, as it has better graphics and is faster although the two versions are basically the same game."<ref name="WD54">{{cite journal  | last =Clarke | first =Russell | title =Microview  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | issue =54  | pages =18â€“19  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  | date = June 1984  }}</ref>

Philippa Irving reviewed ''Apocalypse'' for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' #43 (August 1987), calling the game "an odd blend of realism and fantasy" although it "lacks atmosphere", but concluding that she would "recommend ''Apocalypse'' as a good buy to those who are certain they'll have someone else to play with".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Crash_No._43_1987-08_Newsfield_GB#page/n49/mode/2up/search/apocalypse|title=Crash - No. 43 (1987-08)(Newsfield)(GB)|website=archive.org|date=August 1987 }}</ref>
