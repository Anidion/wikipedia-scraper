Tom Cheche reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "CF has been exhaustively researched, and beautifully produced. In many ways it is the kind of game that we had in mind several years ago when we were daydreaming about where the wargaming hobby was headed now that the computer had arrived."<ref name="CGW15">{{cite magazine |last=Cheche |first=Tom |title=Carrier Force: The Fog of War at its Foggiest |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1984 |volume=1 |issue=15 |pages=22, 47}}</ref> 

In a 1985 survey of computer wargames for ''Current Notes'', M. Evan Brooks called ''Carrier Force'' "worth the effort for anyone desirous of learning about the period", but considered it "extremely slow in execution" and saw it as having historical errors.<ref name=cn1985 /> In his similar 1989 survey, J. L. Miller of ''Computer Play'' found that the game was "hampered by very slow execution" and offered it a middling score.<ref name=computerplay />

==Successor==
Grigsby decided to build on ''Carrier Force'' in his later game ''[[Carrier Strike]]''. He told ''[[Electronic Games]]'', "I liked the subject matter and, given the evolution in computer capability and my programming skills, I wanted to refine it."<ref name=egint />
