It features the [[Looney Tunes]] character [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] in a food frenzy. Within the game, Taz only appears as a [[tornado]].

The player guides Taz between the stage lines in order to eat hamburgers and avoid the dynamites. The game does not use any buttons and the difficulty increases by increasing the speed of the objects on screen. As the game progresses, the burgers may change into other edible or drinkable objects such as root beers, hamburgers, etc. There are not many sound effects in the game except a blipping sound when the player hits an edible object and another sound that resembles of explosion when the player hits [[dynamite]].
