'''''M.A.C.H. 3''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[LaserDisc video game]] developed by [[Gottlieb]] and released for US [[Arcade video game|arcades]] in 1983 under their Mylstar brand. The player controls a high-speed fighter aircraft in one of two missions: either a "Fighter Raid" seen flying forward at low altitude or "Bombing Run" seen in a top-down mode. Video backgrounds from the LaserDisc are overlaid by [[computer graphics]]. The title is both a reference to [[Mach number]] and is an [[acronym]] for "Military Air Command Hunter". It was released in Japan by [[Taito]].
