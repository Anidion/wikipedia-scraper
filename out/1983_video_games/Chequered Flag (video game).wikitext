==Gameplay==
''Chequered Flag'' allows a player to select a racing track and one of three cars; two with manual gears and one automatic. Two of the cars are named Ferretti and McFaster, in reference to Ferrari and McLaren, who had come first and second in the [[1982 Formula One season]].

Tracks available include [[Brands Hatch]], [[Circuit de Monaco]], [[Ã–sterreichring]], [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza]], [[Circuit Paul Ricard]], [[Silverstone Circuit]] and 4 fictitious circuits.

The game is viewed in first-person perspective, from the driver's seat, with each car having a different dashboard layout. With no other cars to race, the aim is to complete laps in the [[Time attack|best time]] possible, avoiding road hazards such as oil and broken glass. The player must also economise fuel and avoid the engine overheating.<ref name='yspec1'>{{cite magazine |title=Spectrum Soft|magazine=Your Spectrum|issue=1|publisher=Sportscene Specialist Press|date=January 1984|page=53|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=316&page=53|access-date=10 October 2023}}</ref> The game was one of the first to feature [[pit stop]]s, which would repair damage and take on fuel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.retrofusion.org.uk/article/618/chequered-flag/# |title=Chequered Flag - Retrofusion |access-date=2011-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044511/http://www.retrofusion.org.uk/article/618/chequered-flag/# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

On its initial release, ''[[Your Spectrum]]'' praised the driver's view graphics,<ref name='yspec1' /> with ''Popular Computing Weekly'' praising the smooth scrolling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/popular-computing-weekly/44|title=Popular Computing Weekly|website=worldofspectrum.org}}</ref> ''ZX Computing'' summarised the game as "realistic,... exciting and highly enjoyable".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/zx-computing/11|title=ZX Computing|website=worldofspectrum.org}}</ref>

In 1985, ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' magazine described the graphics as adequate and the gameplay as good, but felt it was more serious than fun due to the lack of other racers.<ref name="CRASH"/> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' said it was up to the usual Psion standards, and that the quality and the detail included in the game made it one of the best games for the Spectrum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/sinclair-user/21|title=Sinclair User|website=worldofspectrum.org}}</ref>

In their 1990 retrospective of driving games, ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' also lamented the lack of other racers, but they praised the realism of the simulation, considering the age of the game.<ref name="YSdrive"/> The game reached number one in the UK sales charts, ahead of ''[[Manic Miner]]'',<ref name="auto"/> and being replaced by ''[[Jet Set Willy]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/personal-computer-games/7|title=Personal Computer Games|website=worldofspectrum.org}}</ref>
