In ''Zeppelin'' the player takes on the role of a pilot exploring an underground dungeon complex. The goal is to bypass or destroy the cave's defenses, such as laser gates, enemy zeppelins and falling rocks, while trying to blow up enemy lairs using dynamite. Parts of the enemy defense system can be disabled by shooting switches scattered around the cave.

The game offers a two-player mode where one player controls the movement of the zeppelin, while the other controls the guns.

==Reception==
The game has been met with positive reviews. ''The [[Addison-Wesley]] Book of Atari Software 1984'' gave the game a very positive rating (B+) and praised the graphics and two-player mode.<ref name="wesley"/> ''Bits and Bytes'' gave a very positive review of the Commodore 64 version of ''Zeppelin'' in its September 1983 issue: "The sound and graphics are exceptionally good, the colours rich and well-defined, and the background intricately detailed."<ref name="b&b"/>
