'''''No Escape!''''' is an [[Atari 2600]] video game developed and published by [[Imagic]] in 1983. The player controls [[Jason]], leader of the [[Argonauts]], who fights off the [[Erinyes|Furies]] sent by the [[Greek gods]]. A two-player mode, in which the second player competes against the first turn-by-turn, is also available.<ref name="hardcore">{{cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/no-escape/ |title=No Escape! |website=[[Hardcore Gaming 101]] |last=Gill |first1=Charles |date=3 August 2017 |access-date=3 November 2022}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==

''No Escape!'' begins with Jason imprisoned in the temple of [[Aphrodite]] due to stealing the [[Golden Fleece]]. Jason must survive against waves of attacking Furies, and the gameplay revolves around having Jason pick up and throw rocks. The player needs to hit the ceiling of the temple, causing a brick to fall onto a Fury; throwing a rock directly at a Fury causes two more Furies to appear in its place. Gameplay is focused around timing the falling brick to intersect with the moving Furies. Subsequent levels increase the difficulty by having the Furies shoot back at the player, fly around faster, and move in different patterns.<ref name="honest">{{cite web |url=https://www.honestgamers.com/10284/atari-2600/no-escape/review.html |title=No Escape!

The game may be played in single-player mode, or in a two-player mode where each player takes turns.<ref name="times">{{cite web |url=http://ataritimes.com/index.php?ArticleIDX=267 |title=No Escape |website=The Atari Times |last=Nobles |first=Ethan |date=3 August 2002 |access-date=4 November 2022}}</ref>

== Development and release ==

''No Escape!'' was [[video game programmer|programmed]] by Michael Greene with assistance on the screen graphics by Michael Becker and Wilfredo Aguilar.<ref>{{cite magazine | author1=Wilson, Mike | author2=R. Bechtold, Alan | date=September 1983 | title=binary visions: ''NO ESCAPE'' | url=https://archive.org/details/logical_gamer_sep83/page/14/mode/1up | magazine=The Logical Gamer | publisher=Logical Gamer Publications | volume=2 | issue=2 | page=14}}</ref> This was Greene's first project at publisher [[Imagic]], having also worked for the company on the game ''Wing War'' for [[Atari 2600]] and the program ''Talking Teacher'' for [[Commodore 64]]. Greene estimated that it took six months to develop ''No Escape!'' and stated that the game's Greek mythology theme was a different one than what he had initially chosen.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ferguson, Robert | date=February 7, 2014 | title=Q&A with Imagic's Michael Greene | url=https://2600gamebygamepodcast.blogspot.com/2014/02/q-with-imagics-michael-greene.html?m=1 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240508121040/https://2600gamebygamepodcast.blogspot.com/2014/02/q-with-imagics-michael-greene.html?m=1 | archive-date=May 8, 2024 | website=Atari 2600 Game By Game Podcast | accessdate=May 8, 2024}}</ref> Becker and Aguilar collaborated on Imagic's ''Fathom'', a game based on [[Roman mythology]], just before the company's dissolution.<ref>{{cite magazine | author=Persons, Dan | date=March 1984 | title=Soft Spot: ''Fathom'' | url=https://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Volume_2_Number_06_1984-03_Pumpkin_Press_US/page/n80/mode/1up | magazine=Video Games | publisher=Pumpkin Press | volume=2 | issue=6 | page=81 | issn=0733-6780}}</ref>

Imagic released ''No Escape!'' in April 1983. The game included an offer for a free Zircon Video Command joystick by mailing in a coupon from the instruction manual.<ref name="moby">{{cite web |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/no-escape- |title=No Escape!

== Reception ==

The game's action was well received as a cross between [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]] and [[Space Invaders]].<ref name="faqs">{{cite web |url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/atari2600/584928-no-escape/reviews/49895 |title=No Escape! â€“ Review |website=[[GameFAQs]] |author=ihuntley |date=6 March 2003 |access-date=4 November 2022}}</ref> [[Hardcore Gaming 101]] called the game a "rare gem" and said it has a "completely different feel to any other shooter from that time, or, for that matter, any other shooter since".<ref name="hardcore" /> [[IGN]] called it a "strange shooter" but also complimented its "compelling gameplay and some very attractive visuals".<ref name="ign" />  The game was also praised for its final animation showing Jason escaping on [[Pegasus]].<ref name="retro">{{cite web |url=https://retroist.com/no-escape/ |title=No Escape for the Atari 2600 |website=Retroist |date=4 January 2010 |access-date=5 November 2022}}</ref><ref name="times" />

''No Escape!'' received positive reviews for its gameplay, with [[GameFAQs]] writing that its playability was "very good", going on to say: "Jason is easy to control and doesn't move too fast or too slow for the tempo of the game. The difficulty increases gradually, and you find yourself trying to beat your last score."<ref name="faqs" /> In a 1983 review from [[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]], Imagic was praised for delivering a game with the right balance, providing a "challenge that the player can neither overcome nor resist playing again and again."<ref name="fun">{{cite magazine |title=No Escape! |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_09_1983-07_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/mode/2up?view=theater |last1=Wiswell |first1=Phil |last2=DeKoven |first2=Bernie |access-date=5 November 2022 |magazine=[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]] |date=July 1983 |volume=1 |number=9 |page=52}}</ref> Conversely, videogamecritic.com criticized the game's difficulty at later levels.<ref name="critic">{{cite web |url=https://videogamecritic.com/2600no.htm?e=02094#rev293 |title=No Escape! |website=The Video Game Critic |date=3 March 2009 |access-date=6 November 2022}}</ref>
