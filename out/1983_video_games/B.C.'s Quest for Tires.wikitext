'''''B.C.'s Quest for Tires''''' is a horizontally scrolling video game designed by Rick Banks and Michael Bate and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 1983.<ref name="giantlist"/> Versions were released for the [[Commodore 64]], [[IBM PC]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[ColecoVision]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[MSX]], and [[Apple II]]. Based on the [[comic strip]] ''[[B.C. (comic strip)|B.C.]]'' by [[Johnny Hart]], ''BC's Quest for Tires'' is similar to Irem's ''[[Moon Patrol]]'' from the previous year.<ref name="antic198403"/> A wheel-riding caveman is always moving forward through horizontally scrolling levels, and the player jumps or ducks as obstacles approach. The  game's title is a play on the contemporaneous film ''[[Quest for Fire (film)|Quest for Fire]]''.

Both ''B.C.'s Quest for Tires'' and ''[[Moon Patrol]]'' have key elements of the not-yet-invented [[endless runner]] genre, despite both games being divided into discrete levels.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/dont-stop-the-game-that-conquered-smartphones | title=Don't Stop: The Game That Conquered Smartphones | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=7 June 2013 }}</ref>

A sequel, ''[[B.C. II: Grog's Revenge|Grog's Revenge]]'', was released in 1984.

==Plot==
The player takes the role of the [[caveman]] Thor, who has to [[Damsel in distress|rescue his girlfriend]], "Cute Chick", who has been kidnapped by a [[dinosaur]]. To do this, he must travel on his [[Rock (geology)|stone]] [[unicycle]] (actually an [[impossible wheel]]) through several levels. Each level has Thor moving from the left to the right, avoiding various dangers.

''B.C.'s Quest for Tires'' is an [[action game]] taking place on several consecutive levels. Each level consists of Thor having to jump over obstacles such as rocks or stalagmites and ducking under others, like tree branches or stalactites. In between each level is a brief challenge (a precursor to boss battles in later games). The first challenge has Thor jumping on turtles to cross a lake while trying to avoid being hit by the Fat Broad, another has Thor lining up with the Dookie Bird to catch a ride over a lava pit, another challenge has Thor trying to gain enough speed to jump another pit, and the final challenge has Thor jumping on turtles to cross another lake while trying to sneak past the dinosaur. <ref name="jump">{{cite web |title="JUMP!

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' stated that, given the conventional gameplay ("it's that get-from-point-A-to-point-B kind of game"), the use of the familiar comic characters made "the player feel like finishing the game is worthwhile ... [Otherwise] it's just not the same". The magazine concluded that "''B.C.'s Quest for Tires'' isn't so much a computer game as it is an interactive cartoon. This cartoon has its limits, but it does provide some challenge".<ref name="yuen19831112">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=6&id=14 | title=B.C.'s Quest for Tires | work=Softline | date=Nov–Dec 1983 | access-date=29 July 2014 | author=Yuen, Matt | pages=21–22}}</ref> ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' approved of the game not being another "'shoot the aliens and save the world' scenario", and the "first rate" animation, but predicted that most players would "enjoy the game for a day or two, then relegate it to the shelf".<ref name="antic198403">{{Cite journal |last=Bernstein |first=Harvey |date = March 1984|title=Product Reviews |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v2n12/productreviews.html |journal=Antic}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' praised the game's "excellent graphics" and animation, which "approach cartoon standards".<ref name="trunzo198404">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1984-04-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_047_1984_Apr#page/n100/mode/1up | title=B.C.'s Quest for Tires | work=Compute! |date = April 1984| access-date=8 January 2015 | author=Trunzo, James V. | pages=99–100}}</ref>

David Stone reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "QFT requires far more timing than strategy and, rather than levels of play, it offers new obstacles to overcome on the way to the rescue. Still, it is fun to play."<ref name="CGW18">{{cite magazine |last=Stone |first=David |title=Atari Playfield |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1984 |volume=1 |issue=18 |pages=25}}</ref>
