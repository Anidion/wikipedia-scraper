The [[TRS-80]] version was sold through [[Radio Shack]]. The game involves moving a [[pogo stick]] laterally on a platform to find a fraction equivalent to the one shown on-screen.

==Reception==
''[[Ahoy!]]'' unfavorably reviewed the game, criticizing the graphics and "very annoying" sound and stating that "Other than the Chinese water torture, I'm hard pressed to think of a more frustrating or annoying experience for children than trying to play Spinnaker's ''Fraction Fever''. Just ask my kids!"<ref name="tamis198404">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_04_1984-04_Ion_International_US#page/n69/mode/2up | title=Fraction Fever | work=Ahoy! | date=April 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Tamis, Valerie | pages=71}}</ref>
