==Reception==
Noel Steere for ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' said "you can't always find a human opponent to play with you. So unless you're a Siamese twin, ''Heads Up'' gets thumbs down."<ref name="EFCG">{{Cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_02_No_03_1984-01_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/page/n59/mode/2up|journal=[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]|title=Review |volume=2 |number=3 |date=January 15, 1984|page=58}}</ref> The British magazine ''TV Gamer'' said it is a "faithful reproduction of soccer which includes a challenging one player version."<ref name="TVG">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/TV_Gamer_1983-12_Boytonbrook_GB/page/n71/mode/2up?q=heads-up|title=Review |location=Great Britain|work=TV Gamer|date=December 27, 1983|page=72}}</ref> The 1984 Software Encyclopedia from ''[[Electronic Games]]'' gave the game an overall rating of 8, praising how "the horizontally scrolling soccer field allows for good movement and control of the stick-figure soccer players".<ref name="Enc" /> The German magazine ''TeleMatch'' rated the game at 3 stars out of 5.<ref name="TM">{{Cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/TeleMatch.N06.1983.10-KCz.pdf/page/n43/mode/2up|title=Review|number=10|date=October 10, 1983|journal=TeleMatch|language=German|page=44}}</ref> 

Retrospective reviewers were more negative. The reference guide ''Classic Home Videogames'' criticized the game for its simple graphics and slow gameplay, calling the Vectrex "not the best vehicle for sports simulations, as emphasized by this dreadful game."<ref name=":0" /> The criticisms of slow player movement is echoed in The Nostalgia Nerd's Retro Tech, who noted "a side-scrolling four-on-four soccer simulation was a bit outside" the strengths of the Vectrex.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leigh|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLZgDwAAQBAJ&q=soccer&pg=PT135|title=The Nostalgia Nerd's Retro Tech: Computer, Consoles & Games|date=2018-11-01|publisher=Octopus Books|isbn=978-1-78157-682-3|language=en}}</ref>
