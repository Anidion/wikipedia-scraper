'''''Business Games''''' is a collection of two [[business simulation game]]s for the [[BBC Micro]] published in 1983 by [[Acornsoft]]. An [[Acorn Electron]] version followed in 1984. The included games are '''Stokmark''' and '''Telemark'''.

==Gameplay==

===''Stokmark''===
''Stokmark'' is a simulation of the [[stock market]]. Up to eight players take turns to either buy or sell shares in a choice of four companies. As well as the price, players are given the [[P/E ratio|price-to-earnings ratio]] and [[dividend yield]]. Prices change instantly when transactions are made (usually based on the standard [[supply and demand]] principle although there is a random element). After each round a news story is displayed which affects the value of certain shares. After every four rounds, players are awarded [[dividends]] on the shares they hold and are ranked on their total current value (of both cash and shares). The object of the game is to make the largest amount of profit.<ref name="instructions">[http://8bs.com/elecgame/businessgames.htm Original instructions] reproduced at 8bs.com (cited 2011-11-07)</ref>

===''Telemark''===
''Telemark'' is a four player game where each player has to make decisions based on the manufacturing of televisions. This includes whether to build or extend factories, spend on improving management or marketing, and setting the price. When the player enters their price, it is not displayed on the screen so other players do not know what their competitors are charging until the end of each round. The game introduces terms and reports such as [[market share]], [[Overhead (business)|overheads]], [[Income statement|profit and loss accounts]] and [[balance sheet]]s. The instruction booklet provides detailed instructions on working out the [[Break-even (economics)|break-even]] point as well as blank worksheets to be filled out by the players. The winner is the player who has made the most profit after a set number of rounds or the first player to gain more than half the market share for televisions.<ref name="instructions" />

==Release==
''Business Games'' was released in 1983 as part of Acornsoft's Education range which was aimed at schools as well as home users. As it only requires 16k [[Random-access memory|RAM]], it runs on the [[BBC Micro]] Model A as well as the Model B. It was also released for the [[Acorn Electron]] in 1984. The instructions recommend the games for teaching business and economic studies<ref name="instructions" /> but the Acorn Electron version in particular was well known among home users, as it was often included with the Acornsoft software packs bundled with Electrons in 1984 and 1985.<ref name="software pack">[http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/66/a-rare.html "What's It Worth"] Dave E, EUG #66, Electron User Group "Most Electrons came bundled with five Acornsoft games (Typically Arcadians, Boxer, Business Games, Chess and Hopper)"</ref>

==Reception==
The package was reviewed by Ken Garrett for [[The Micro User]] which was largely positive. ''Stokmark'' was described as "a well-presented and useful introduction to some investment terms" but also "rather repetitive".<ref name="micro user">[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/themicrouser/reviews/games/businessgames.htm "Business Games"], The Micro User, Database Publications, Vol 2 No 1, March 1984</ref> He claimed ''Telemark'' is "a good game and to be properly appreciated must be played seriously".<ref name="micro user" />
