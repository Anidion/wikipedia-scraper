The [[isometric projection|isometric]], scrolling playfield consists platforms connected by ladders. Players alternately control Flip, a kangaroo who jumps around on the platforms, and Mitch, an ape who hangs under the platforms. Flip is chased by a zookeeper and Mitch is chased by a net, both of which are lured by sticky squares that delay them for several seconds. The player loses a life for being caught or falling off the playfield. The goal is to flip over all of the marked squares by moving over them. Every five levels there is a short sequence with a small circus presentation.

Levels become progressively more complicated. In Level 13, the maximum playing field size is reached. Later. marked squares must be uncovered twice and there may not be sticky fields to slow the zookeeper or the net.

== Reception ==
In 1984, German magazine ''64'er'' stated that it was the best example of the genre.<ref>[http://www.zock.com/64er/8404/0016.html 64'er issue 4/April 1984, p. 48-49]</ref>

== Legacy ==
''Clown-O-Mania'' (1989) is an extended clone for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Clown-O-Mania|url=http://hol.abime.net/3046|website=Hall of Light}}</ref>
