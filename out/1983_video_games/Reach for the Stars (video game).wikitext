'''''Reach for the Stars''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[strategy video game|strategy]] video game. It is the earliest known commercially published example of the [[4X]] genre. It was written by [[Roger Keating]] and Ian Trout of [[Strategic Studies Group|SSG]] of [[Australia]] and published in 1983 for the [[Commodore 64]] and then the [[Apple II]] in 1985. Versions for [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]], [[Amiga]], [[Apple IIGS]], and [[DOS]] were released in 1988.

The player commands a home star in the galaxy, and then expands to form an interstellar empire by colonizing far-off worlds, building powerful starships, and researching new technologies.

''Reach for the Stars'' was very strongly influenced by the board game ''[[Stellar Conquest]]''. Many of ''RFTS'''s features have direct correspondence in ''Stellar Conquest''.

Graphics are minimal, yet the tactical and strategic elements provide countless rich combinations for colony development and interstellar warfare. The software's [[Artificial intelligence in video games|AI]] also offered a challenging opponent in single-player games. It is not uncommon for a ''Reach for the Stars'' game to take over twelve hours to complete in [[single-player video game|single-player mode]] and 24 hours with multiple players.

==Gameplay==
In Versions 1 to 3 the player starts off with one planet that has Level 1 technology and a middle level environment. Three types of ships are available:

#Scouts – very inexpensive, incapable of fighting or carrying colonists. These can be used as a low-cost, low-risk means to learn the composition of unknown star systems or the locations and makeup of enemy fleets.
#Transports – incapable of fighting, but can carry colonists.
#Warships – incapable of carrying colonists, but can fight.

Starting players have limited funds, and have to decide where to invest the funds (technology upgrades, ships, or environmental upgrades). Upgrading a world's planetary environment, for example, means that its population grows more quickly, improving production; this is a mixed blessing, however, because if the population grows beyond the maximum allowed for that planet, the costs to feed the population skyrocket. Building a lot of ships early can win a player the game, if the player finds his enemies' home planets before they manage to upgrade their military technology; on the other hand, it can lead to a loss if the player's opponents upgrade first and attack with superior ships.

Each turn is divided into two sections – a development phase, and a movement phase. In the development phase, players work on planetary production, deciding what each planet will produce that turn. In the movement phase, players have the option to send ships to other star systems to explore, colonize, or conquer.

Because the game evolves along so many different axes of possibility, the game offers tremendous replay value. It is quite possible to save a game on the first turn, and have it play out differently each time it is restored.

A bug causes human players that do nothing to become wealthy while computer opponents fight each other. The designers added a feature that causes the computer opponents to attack the human at 20,000 credits.<ref name="cgw199407">{{Cite magazine |last1=Wilson |first1=Johnny L. |last2=Brown |first2=Ken |last3=Lombardi |first3=Chris |last4=Weksler |first4=Mike |last5=Coleman |first5=Terry |date=July 1994 |title=The Designer's Dilemma: The Eighth Computer Game Developers Conference |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=120 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=26–31}}</ref>

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1983 found ''Reach for the Stars'' quite user-friendly and enjoyable, with the single flaw of a lack of notification of natural disasters, which could not fit onto the disk space available.

A series of books was written in 2018 by the game company Greentwip, called ''Interstellar'', ''Anatomy'' and ''The Garlan Wars''. While its publication is still ongoing, it is being said that a TV channel would produce cinematographic films out of the books. This happened after Greentwip's founder got deep into the story and proposed to give a better and linear approach to all the species that the game aims to deliver to the player, in order to become a better "pure Sci-Fi" experience.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SVCKNDN/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Reach+for+the+stars&qid=1559830035&s=digital-text&sr=1-2 Reach For The Stars: Interstellar (Spanish Edition) – Kindle edition by LTD, Greentwip.
