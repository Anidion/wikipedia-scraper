'''''Lords of Time''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] game designed by Sue Gazzard and released by [[Level 9 Computing]] in 1983. Originally purely a textual adventure for [[8-bit era|8-bit]] microcomputers, the game was later released as part of the ''[[Time and Magik]]'' compilation where [[computer graphics|graphics]] were added for all floppy disk versions. Like all [[Level 9 Computing|Level 9]] adventures of its time, it was written in the in-house A-code language which was platform-independent.

==Gameplay==
The anonymous hero of the game (controlled by the player) appears to be a computer programmer in contemporary times. At the start of the game, the hero is contacted by Father Time who sends the hero on a quest to recover nine treasures in order to defeat the machinations of the evil Time Lords. The game is divided into 9 eras of time (not including the starting section in the hero's living room), such as the 20th century, [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]], age of [[dinosaur]]s, [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], future, the [[Middle Ages]], [[Tudor period|Tudor]] [[England]] and the [[Roman Empire]]. Due to the meddling of the Time Lords [[anachronism]]s abound, for example [[cavemen]] are found living in the same era as [[dinosaur]]s.

Access to the nine different eras is via a [[grandfather clock]] that turns out to be a [[Time travel|time machine]] in disguise.

The game was re-released in 1988 as part of the ''[[Time and Magik]]'' compilation alongside ''Red Moon'' and ''Price of Magik''. Although positioned within the compilation as the first part of a trilogy it has no real connection to the latter two <ref>{{cite journal |date=July 1988 | title = The Your Sinclair Rock and Roll Years | journal = [[Your Sinclair]] | issue = 31 | url = http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/timeandmagik.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-14}}</ref> (as opposed to the sister compilation release ''[[Silicon Dreams trilogy|Silicon Dreams]]'' where all three games did form a trilogy).

==Reception==
Reception to Lords of Time was positive. ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' reviewing the [[ZX Spectrum|Spectrum]] version declared "I find it impossible to justly describe what a brilliant adventure Lords of Time really is".<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 1984 | title = Reviews | journal = [[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]] | issue = April 1984 | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue03/Pages/Crash0300030.jpg | accessdate = 2008-01-14 | page = 30}}
</ref> A ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine multiformat review claimed "..the game is a light-hearted one which is fun to play, not too difficult to progress in, but will, I suspect, take rather a long time to complete. Who could ask for more?" <ref>{{cite journal |date=May 1984 | title = Adventure | journal = [[C&VG]] | issue = 31 | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue031/Pages/CVG03100164.jpg | accessdate = 2008-01-14 | page = 165}}</ref> ''[[Personal Computer Games]]'' rated it a PCG Hit<ref>
