The object of ''Abracadabra!'' is to face the ultimate test underneath the wizard's castle.<ref name=ad/> The player must navigate 16 levels, collecting the keys and delivering them to the keyholes to reveal the entrance to the next level. The player is perpetually chased by different enemies, including beetles and snakes, which can be vanquished by the player's projectile spell. Additional difficulty is created by constantly moving walls, which will crush the player if he is not careful. There is also a time limit allocated to solve every level.

==Reception==
In a retrospective review, Polish website ''retronagazie.eu'' concluded: "It is not a great hit, but still quite playable. A 'mediocre plus' game and, if one counts in the nostalgia, even a good one".<ref name=retro/> German Atari magazine ''Zong'' gave the game a positive review in its November 1992 issue, emphasizing that it can keep the player engaged for long periods of time, especially when played in two-player mode. All in all, the reviewer found the game worth buying.<ref name="zong"/>
