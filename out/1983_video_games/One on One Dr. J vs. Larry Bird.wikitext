'''''One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird''''', commonly known as '''''One on One''''', is a [[basketball]] video game written by Eric Hammond for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1983. It was initially ported to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[IBM PC compatibles]] (as a [[self-booting disk]]). Versions followed for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]], [[Classic Mac OS]], [[Amiga]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. In Europe, the publisher was [[Ariolasoft]]. [[Atari Corporation]] released an [[Atari 7800]] port in 1987.

==Gameplay==
The player controls basketball star [[Julius Erving]] or [[Larry Bird]] in a game of one-on-one against another player or the [[artificial intelligence|computer]]. The game includes [[personal foul (basketball)|personal foul]]s, a 24-second [[shot clock]], [[jumper (basketball)|jumper]]s, [[fall-away (basketball)|fadeaway]]s, [[putback]]s, and what is likely the first [[instant replay]] in video games.{{r|Vice}} It allows for play to a certain score or timed games. On offense, a player can spin or shoot; on defense, attempt to block or steal the ball, with over aggressiveness penalized by fouls. A hard dunk can [[Backboard shattering|shatter the backboard]], prompting a [[janitor]] to come out and sweep up the shards, directing censored complaints at the player in the process. The game used Scott Joplin's "[[Maple Leaf Rag]]" as its title screen soundtrack.

==Development==

The game was developed while [[Trip Hawkins]] was unsuccessfully attempting to develop a video game based on [[American football]] (an effort which eventually led to the creation of the ''[[Madden NFL]]'' series). Influenced by a televised one-on-one basketball tournament he remembered watching when he was younger, Hawkins decided to create a game based on the concept. He signed Julius Erving, his favorite basketball player at the time. Erving went to Electronic Arts headquarters for principal photography and to offer advice to the developers. Erving and Bird were each paid $25,000 to appear in the game, along with a 2.5 percent royalty. In addition, Erving received some stock in Electronic Arts.<ref name="Vice">{{Cite web|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/wje9kq/how-dr-j-and-larry-bird-helped-build-a-video-game-empire|work=Vice Sports|publisher=Vice Media LLC|date=May 25, 2017|title=How Dr. J and Larry Bird Helped Build a Video Game Empire|author=Sauer, Patrick|access-date=June 22, 2017}}</ref>

The game's simpler half-court set-up allowed the team to focus on adding more realism, including more accurate physics and animations. A planned feature that would have made Bird and Erving play more similarly to their real-life counterparts did not make the final game.<ref name="Vice" />

The cover photograph for the game's [[Gramophone record|record]]-style package, was taken while Erving and Bird were visiting the [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]]. The crowd sounds heard in the Amiga version were recorded by Hawkins and producer [[Joe Ybarra]] at a [[Golden State Warriors]] game.<ref name="Vice" />

==Reception==
''One on One'' was successful, helping EA avoid financial difficulty and increasing retailers' familiarity with the company.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Colin|title=How EA lost its soul, chapter 8|url=http://www.polygon.com/a/how-ea-lost-its-soul/chapter-8|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|access-date=15 July 2015|date=14 July 2015}}</ref> In 1984 ''ST.Game''{{'}}s readers named the game the eighth most-popular Apple program of 1983.<ref name="stgame19840304">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&pub=6&id=16 | title=The Best and the Rest | work=ST.Game | date=March–April 1984 | access-date=28 July 2014 | pages=49}}</ref> It was also awarded Electronic Game of the Year by the 1985 Arkie Awards, presented by [[Electronic Games|Electronic Games Magazine]].<ref name=Arkie>{{cite magazine | author=Staff | title=1985 Arkie Awards | date=January 1985 | url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_03_Number_01_1985-01_Reese_Communications_US/page/n21/mode/2up | volume=3| issue=1 | magazine=[[Electronic Games]] | pages=22}}</ref> ''One on One'' was Electronic Arts' best-selling game, and second best-selling Commodore 64 game, as of late 1987.<ref name="ferrell198712">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-12-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_54_1987_Dec#page/n17/mode/2up | title=The Commodore Games That Live On And On | work=Compute's Gazette | date=December 1987 | access-date=24 January 2015 | author=Ferrell, Keith | pages=18–22}}</ref> It was certified "SPA Platinum" (sales of 250,000 copies) by November 1989,<ref name=gpsales>{{cite journal | author=Staff | title=Chart-Busters; SPA Platinum | date=November 1989 | issue=5 | journal=[[Game Players]] | page=112}}</ref> after having sold 400,000 copies by late 1988 and becoming the highest-selling sports game ever for computers.<ref name=cgwsales>{{cite magazine | author=Staff | title=Michael Jordan and ''CGW'' Go One on One | date=October 1988 | url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_52/page/n31/mode/2up | issue=52 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=32, 33}}</ref>

''[[InfoWorld]]'' in 1984 called ''One on One'' "perhaps the most talked-about sports game of the new year". The magazine praised its portrayal of the two players' individual styles, [[backboard shattering]], crowd noise, and instant replay, concluded that "''One On One'' delivers the goods: a realistic simulation of a lively sports matchup".<ref name="mace19840227">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gy4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66 | title=Olympic games on the way | work=InfoWorld | date=27 February 1984 | access-date=29 July 2014 | author=Mace, Scott | pages=66}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1984 called ''One on One'' "incredibly realistic" and predicted that it would be one of the year's best sports games.

==Legacy==
The original ''One on One'' has been credited as a game that helped establish Electronic Arts as a successful game company and would also foreshadow how important sports titles would be to the company's future.<ref name="Vice" /> [[EA Sports]] would later be spun off into its own division.

The sequel, ''[[Jordan vs. Bird: One on One|Jordan vs Bird]]'', was released in 1988 with improved graphics, [[Michael Jordan]] taking the Doctor's place, a slam dunk contest with Jordan, and a [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] shootout with Bird.
