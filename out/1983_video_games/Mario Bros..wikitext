{{Nihongo foot|'''''Mario Bros.'''''|マリオブラザーズ|Mario Burazāzu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (sometimes nicknamed as ''Pipeline'') is a [[platform game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] as an [[arcade video game]] in 1983. It was designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Gunpei Yokoi]], Nintendo's chief engineer. Italian twin brother plumbers [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] exterminate creatures, like turtles (Koopas) and crabs emerging from the sewers by knocking them upside-down and kicking them away. The [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System]] version is the first game produced by [[Intelligent Systems]]. It is part of the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' franchise, but originally began as a spin-off from the ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' series.

The arcade and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System]] versions were received positively by critics. Elements introduced in ''Mario Bros.'', such as spinning bonus coins, turtles that can be flipped onto their backs, and Luigi, were carried over to ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985) and became staples of the series.

An updated version, titled ''Mario Bros. Classic'', is included as a [[minigame]] in all of the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series and ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]''. ''Mario Bros.'' has been re-released through Nintendo's online stores for later systems.

==Development==
[[File: Shigeru Miyamoto GDC 2007.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Shigeru Miyamoto]] ''(pictured)'' and [[Gunpei Yokoi]] collaborated on the design of ''Mario Bros.'']]

''Mario Bros.'' was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead developers for the video game ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''. In ''Donkey Kong'', Mario dies if he falls too far. For ''Mario Bros.'', Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto that Mario should be able to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was not sure of, thinking that it would make it "not much of a game." He eventually agreed, thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario "jumping and bouncing around", which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors. However, it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they've been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below.<ref name="wii">{{Cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page1.jsp |title=Wii.com – Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros.

A popular story of how Mario went from Jumpman to Mario is that an Italian-American landlord, [[Mario Segale]], had barged in on Nintendo of America's staff to demand rent, and they decided to name Jumpman after him.<ref name="nyt20181102">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/obituaries/mario-segale-dies-super-mario.html|date=November 2, 2018|title=Mario Segale, Developer Who Inspired Nintendo to Name Super Mario, Dies at 84|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227175918/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/obituaries/mario-segale-dies-super-mario.html|archive-date=February 27, 2019|url-status=live|last1=Zraick|first1=Karen}}</ref> Miyamoto also felt that the best setting for this game was New York because of its labyrinthine subterranean network of sewage pipes.<ref name="powerup56"/> The pipes were inspired by several [[manga]], which Miyamoto states feature waste grounds with pipes lying around. In this game, they were used in a way to allow the enemies to enter and exit the stage through them to avoid getting enemies piled up on the bottom of the stage. The green coloring of the pipes, which Nintendo late president [[Satoru Iwata]] called an uncommon color, came from Miyamoto having a limited color palette and wanting to keep things colorful. He added that green was the best because it worked well when two shades of it were combined.<ref name="wii"/>

''Mario Bros.'' introduced Mario's brother, Luigi, who was created for the multiplayer mode by doing a palette swap of Mario.<ref name="historyofmariopg1"/> The two-player mode and several aspects of gameplay were inspired by ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Matt |title=The Video Games Guide |publisher=Boxtree Ltd |year=2006 |isbn=0-7522-2625-8 |pages=261–262}}</ref> To date, ''Mario Bros.'' has been released for more than a dozen platforms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://toadscastle.net/list-games.html | publisher=Toad's Castle | author=Eric Marcarelli | title=Every Mario Game | access-date=October 1, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014064028/http://www.toadscastle.net/list-games.html | archive-date=October 14, 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> The first movement from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'' is used at the start of the game.<ref name="mozart">{{cite news|title=Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix|url=http://www.nindb.net/game/ddr-mario-mix.html|access-date=September 26, 2008|work=NinDB|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619110057/http://nindb.net/game/ddr-mario-mix.html|archive-date=June 19, 2010}}</ref> This song has been used in later video games, including ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix]]''<ref name="mozart"/> and ''[[Super Smash Bros.

In Taiwan and Mainland China, the game is sometimes nicknamed as Pipeline (管道) or Mr. Mary (瑪莉) due to the fact that pirated copies of this game were distributed very widely, and pirate companies could not use the real name of the game and characters to bypass copyright.

A version of the game was announced alongside the [[Virtual Boy]] hardware itself at [[Nintendo Space World 1994]]. Footage demonstrated showed a faithful recreation of the game, albeit with the Virtual Boy's trademark graphical qualities of [[Virtual Boy#Display| monochrome red and black graphics]] and a slight [[stereoscopic 3D]] effect. Its demonstration was generally poorly received by video game publications, which lamented the selection of a decade-old game to demonstrate the technology of the new Virtual Boy hardware. ''Mario Bros.
