'''''Plaque Attack''''' is a 1983 [[video game]] for the [[Atari 2600]] that was made by [[Activision]]. The player must shoot food to protect teeth inside a person's mouth. [[Steve Cartwright]], who designed the game, said that game was meant to help people develop good dental habits.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Gameplay==

The player controls a tube of [[toothpaste]], defending teeth against various types of food, such as hamburgers and [[french fries]]. The objective is to fire toothpaste at [[food]] intent on destroying the teeth. If the food touches a tooth, it begins breaking down the tooth. If the player is fast enough to shoot the piece of food as soon as it starts breaking down the tooth the player will be able to save the tooth. If not, the tooth will decay and disappears from the screen. The food comes in waves, and the movements become more complicated. Destroying the food scores points, as does the number of teeth and the amount of toothpaste left at the end of each wave.

After a certain number of points is scored, users gain bonus teeth. Bonus teeth are applied at the end of each wave. If all eight teeth are still present, the additional teeth will be placed on the sides of the mouth.  Otherwise the teeth will replace any teeth lost.  Play continues until all the teeth are gone, at which point the game is over.

Players who scored more than 35,000 points could send a screenshot of their accomplishment to Activision to receive a "No Plaque Pack" patch and congratulatory letter.

== Aquafresh Rebate Program ==
From August through mid-November 1983, a mail-in rebate program ran in newspaper advertisements to cross-promote [[List of toothpaste brands|Aquafresh]] and Plaque Attack. The ad offered a $3.15 savings in the form of an instant $0.15 credit for any size Aquafresh toothpaste, and a $3.00 rebate from Activation after sending in the Aquafresh and Plaque Attack [[proof of purchase]]. <ref>{{cite news |title=Save Up to $3.15 with Aqua-fresh and Plaque Attack |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=7 August 1983}}</ref>
