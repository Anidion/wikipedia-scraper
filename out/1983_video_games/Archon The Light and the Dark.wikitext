'''''Archon: The Light and the Dark''''' is a 1983 [[video game]] developed by [[Free Fall Associates]] and one of the first five games published by [[Electronic Arts]]. It is superficially similar to [[chess]], in that it takes place on a board with alternating black and white squares, but instead of fixed rules when landing on another player's piece, an arcade-style fight takes place to determine the victor, and each piece has different combat abilities. The health of the player's piece is enhanced when landing on a square of one's own color.

''Archon'' was originally written for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and then [[porting|ported]] to the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amiga]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] (as a [[self-booting disk]]), [[Mac (computer)|Mac]], [[NEC PC-8801|PC-88]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]. It was designed by [[Paul Reiche III]] (who also created the graphics for the game) and [[Jon Freeman (game designer)|Jon Freeman]] and programmed by [[Anne Westfall]].

A sequel was released in 1984: ''[[Archon II: Adept]]''.

==Gameplay==
===Overview and objective===
[[File:C64 Archon.png|thumb|left|C64 screenshot]]
The goal of the game is either to occupy five power points located on the board, to eliminate all the opposing pieces, or to eliminate all but one remaining imprisoned piece of the opponent's.  Accomplishing any one of these goals results in a win.<ref name=EA-manual>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/ArchonEAManual/ |title=Archon Manual |author1=Freeman, Jon |author2=Reiche III, Paul |publisher=Electronic Arts |date=1983 |access-date=26 July 2023}}</ref>{{rp|2}}

When one piece lands on the same space as an opposing piece, the removal of the targeted piece is not automatic. Instead, the two pieces are placed into a full-screen 'combat arena' and must battle (action-style, with the players operating the combatants) to determine who takes the square.<ref name=EA-manual/>{{rp|2}}<ref name=mechanics>[http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/44 Secrets of ''Archon'' at vintagecomputing.com] - detailing mechanics of the Atari 800 version.</ref> A stronger piece will generally defeat a weaker piece, but not always, and a fight can result in both pieces being eliminated. This uncertainty adds a level of complexity to the game. Different pieces have different abilities in the combat phase. These include movement, lifespan, and weapon. The weapons vary by range, speed, rate of firing, and power. For example, the [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] (represented by [[knight]]s on the 'light' side and [[goblin]]s on the 'dark' side) attacks quickly, but has very little strength; its weapon, a sword or club, has limited reach and power. A [[dragon]] is stronger and can attack from a distance, while a [[golem]] moves slowly and fires a slow but powerful boulder.

===Game board===
[[File:Archon board.svg|thumb|right|9×9 board for ''Archon'']]
The board is visually similar to a chessboard and is laid out with nine columns and nine rows. There are five "power points", arranged at the center of each edge and the center of the board. A piece on a power point heals faster and is immune to spells cast by the opponent.<ref name=EA-manual/>{{rp|3}}

A piece's powers are affected by the square on which the battle takes place, with each player having an advantage on squares of their own color.<ref name=EA-manual/>{{rp|3}} Each quadrant of sixteen squares (e.g., A1:D4) in each corner of the board has six dark squares, six light squares, and four oscillating squares which cycle between light and dark, making them dangerous to hold over time; these quadrants are separated by oscillating squares along the middle column (E) and row (5). In total, 27 squares on the board ({{frac|3}}) oscillate between light and dark.

The three power points in the middle column (E) are on oscillating squares. The two power points on the left and right edges are permanently assigned (A5 = light, I5 = dark) and are the respective starting squares for the spellcaster/leaders of each side.

===Icons===
Each player starts with 18 icons, or pieces, from 8 different types,<ref name=EA-manual/>{{rp|2}} arranged in the two columns on either side of the board, Light starting on the left and Dark starting on the right.

;Notes
{{notelist}}

Each piece has one of three movement types: ground, flying, or teleport. Ground types cannot move diagonally or through an occupied square. Flying and teleport types do not have these restrictions but cannot end their move in a square already occupied by that player's pieces.<ref name=EA-manual/>{{rp|5}}

Most pieces have missile attacks, except the knight/goblin (short-range swinging attacks) and banshee/phoenix (short-range area attacks). Barriers in the combat arena cycle through light and dark; when the barriers match the background color, they are effectively no longer present.<ref name=EA-manual/>{{rp|6}}

Some pieces have special abilities. The [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] can turn into a ball of fire, both damaging the enemy and shielding itself from enemy attacks. The shapeshifter assumes the shape and abilities of whatever piece it is up against. ''[[MikroBitti]]'' magazine once wrote that the phoenix and the shapeshifter facing each other usually end up as the most boring battle in the entire game; both combatants' capabilities are simultaneously offensive and defensive, and they tend to use it whenever they meet each other, and thus both rarely get damaged.

Each side also has a [[Magician (fantasy)|spellcaster]] piece, who are the leaders: the sorceress for the dark side and the wizard for the light side. The sorceress and the wizard can cast seven different spells. Each spell may be used only once per game by each spellcaster.<ref name=EA-manual/>{{rp|5}}

{|class="wikitable sortable" style="font-size:100%;"
|+''Archon'' spells<ref name=EA-manual/>{{rp|6–7}}
! Name !! class="unsortable" | Effect
|-
! Teleport
| Moves a friendly piece to another location, unless the piece is imprisoned or the destination is not already occupied by a friendly piece or is a power point. Opposing pieces cannot be ''teleported''.
|-
! Heal
| ''Heals'' all wounds to a friendly piece, unless the piece is on a power point.
|-
! Shift Time
| Shifts direction of oscillation cycle (e.g., if squares are changing from light to dark, ''shift time'' will result in cycling back towards light); if the cycle is at its peak, it abruptly shifts squares to the opposite peak (e.g., swaps light for dark tiles).
|-
! Exchange
| Swap the locations of two selected pieces. If either piece is imprisoned or on a power point, an ''exchange'' is not possible.
|-
! Summon Elemental
| ''Summons'' a temporary elemental to battle any opponent piece that is not on a power point; the elemental disappears after the battle, regardless of the outcome. The elemental is one of four types (air, earth, fire, or water), chosen randomly.
|-
! Revive
| ''Revives'' any friendly icon previously removed from the board after combat onto an empty square adjacent to the spellcaster.
|-
! Imprison
| ''Imprison'' confines an opponent piece to the square it is currently occupying, preventing it from moving but combat is still possible if a friendly piece is moved onto that square; if the square is shifting colors, the imprisonment is ended once it matches the opponent's color. Imprison cannot be used for pieces on a power point, nor can it be used on a piece that would be freed based on its background color.

More rarely, a side may also win by imprisoning its opponent's last remaining piece. If each side has but a single piece, and the two pieces destroy each other in combat, then the game ends in a tie.

[[Orson Scott Card]] reviewed the game for ''[[Compute!]]'' in 1983.

==Legacy==
Free Fall developed a sequel for the same platforms, ''[[Archon II: Adept]]'', released by Electronic Arts in 1984. Ten years later an enhanced version of the original was published by [[Strategic Simulations]] as ''[[Archon Ultra]]''.

The original game was rewritten for [[Palm OS]] in 2000 by Carsten Magerkurth, who contacted members Free Fall Associates for feedback on creating an improved version released in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://palm-os.appmobilize.com/apps/21/archon |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130117024826/http://palm-os.appmobilize.com/apps/21/archon |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-17 |title=Archon - Palm OS Apps |publisher=Palm-os.appmobilize.com |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref>

''Archon: Evolution'' used [[source code|code]] from the original 8-bit version with the blessing of Jon Freeman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archonevolution.com/game/game.asp |title=Archived archonevolution.com website, mentioning Freeman's involvement |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2013-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040101083910/http://www.archonevolution.com/game/game.asp |archivedate=January 1, 2004}}</ref>
