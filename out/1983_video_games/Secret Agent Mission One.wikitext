==Reception==
James A McPherson reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The game is very playable. My previous encounters with games of this type sometimes left me stuck in situations that to me had no logical answer in relationship to the game scenario. The answers or actions required in Secret Agent, while hard, are logical to the surroundings."<ref name="CGW13">{{cite magazine |last=McPherson |first=James A |title=Micro-Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=December 1983 |volume=1 |issue=13 |pages=45}}</ref>
