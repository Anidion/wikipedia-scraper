==Reception==
Bill Wallace reviewed ''Space Cowboy'' in ''[[Space Gamer]]'' No. 70.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Wallace |first=Bill |date=Julyâ€“August 1984 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=70|pages=50}}</ref> Wallace commented that "The action is idiotic, wooden, boring after only a couple of minutes of play.  If you'd never seen ''[[Zaxxon]]'' the three-quarter perspective would be interesting, though it doesn't really contribute to play."<ref name="SG"/>
