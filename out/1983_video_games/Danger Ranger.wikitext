==Gameplay==
The objective of the game is to traverse two different screens. In the first screen, consisting of five floors, the player must jump between platforms, collecting all the keys while avoiding bats and bullets.<ref name=boyle/> After collecting the tenth key, the player moves on to the second screen, walking on platforms and collecting treasure chests while avoiding acid rain drops and shooting deadly masks.<ref name=boyle/>

Once both screens are completed, they are repeated at a higher difficulty level.

==Reception==
''[[Dragon User]]'' reviewed the game in its April 1984 issue and stated that it is not Ken Kalish's best game, but it does show some originality.<ref name="du"/> A reviewer for ''Games Computing'' found the Commodore 64 version to be "very difficult" in an October 1984 review.<ref name="gc"/>
