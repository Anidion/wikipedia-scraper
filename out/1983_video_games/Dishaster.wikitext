'''''Dishaster''''' is an [[action game]] released for the [[Atari 2600]] in 1983 by [[Zimag]].<ref name=Weiss>{{cite web|last1=Weiss|first1=Brett Alan|title=Dishaster|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9353|website=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=June 6, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211142749/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9353|archivedate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Another version of the game was released by [[Bit Corporation]] under the name ''Dancing Plates'' which features oriental-themed graphics and adds eight game variations.<ref name=digitpress>{{cite journal|title=Dishaster|journal=Digital Press|date=Summer 1996|issue=31|pages=29–30|url=https://archive.org/stream/Digital_Press_Issue_31_1996-07_Santulli_Joe_US#page/n29/mode/2up|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>

''Dishaster'' was inspired by the [[circus]] tradition of keeping spinning plates suspended on poles.<ref name=Weiss/> The player controls a girl attempting to keep a group of several spinning plates balanced on poles from falling. The game received negative reviews; criticism focused on the game's repetition and monotony.

The girl can stabilize wobbling dishes by pressing the button on the controller.<ref name=inst>{{cite book|title=Dishaster instruction booklet|date=1983|publisher=Zimag|page=2|url=http://atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=142|access-date=2014-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214163725/http://atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=142|archive-date=2015-02-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> If a plate falls, the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground, and a new one appears at the top of the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest.<ref name=Weiss/> The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground.<ref name=inst/>

==Reception==
The reviewer for ''TV Gamer'' magazine wrote, in 1983, "''Dishaster'' may be enjoyed by very young gamers, but it is not sophisticated enough for any battle-hardened arcade gamers."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Dishaster|journal=TV Gamer|date=June 1983|page=22|url=https://archive.org/stream/TV_Gamer_1983-06_Boytonbrook_GB#page/n21/mode/2up|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>

Non-contemporary reviews were negative. Author Brett Weiss stated that ''Dishaster'' was "as bad as its unfunny title implies" and that it was "a hopelessly repetitive game". While Weiss found the graphics "convincing," he remarked that "the plate-spinning action gets old in a hurry".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Brett|title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972&ndash;1984: A Complete Reference Guide|date=March 7, 2012|publisher=McFarland|page=53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&pg=PA53|isbn=9780786487554}}</ref> Al Backiel, a reviewer for the newsletter and website ''Digital Press'', wrote: {{quote|''Dishaster'' gets to be so monotonous so quickly because if you play in a systematic manner it's too easy: I move sequentially from left to right and repeat. Yep, really tough pattern. I was able to max out the easy version without dropping a plate after several hours. I was hoping something interesting would happen, but the score just resets to zero after passing 999,999.<ref name=digitpress/>}}

Another ''Digital Press'' writer, Kevin Oleniacz, included the game in his "The Worst of the Atari 2600" list, writing: "The lack of sound effects, details or any background whatsoever while maneuvering around one unchanging screen would surely claim this as a DISASTER".<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Worst of the Atari 2600|journal=Digital Press|date=September–October 1991|issue=1|page=5|url=https://archive.org/stream/Digital_Press_Issue_01_1991-09_Santulli_Joe_US#page/n3/mode/2up|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>
