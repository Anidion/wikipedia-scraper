'''''Bomb Alley''''' is a 1983 [[computer wargame]] designed by [[Gary Grigsby]] and published by [[Strategic Simulations|Strategic Simulations, Inc.]] (SSI). Covering the [[Mediterranean Theatre of World War II]], it runs on the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] platform. It has the distinction of being the first true land-sea-air computer wargame, where ground troops could advance and retreat across land.

The game's main scenario is the summer of 1942 when [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]]'s forces threatened to capture [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]]. There is also a smaller scenario covering the [[Battle of Crete]] in 1941. ''Bomb Alley'' was Grigsby's second game, following ''[[Guadalcanal Campaign (video game)|Guadalcanal Campaign]]'' (1982). It reuses that title's [[game engine|engine]], and was [[Source code|coded]] and distributed as [[Compiler|uncompiled]] [[Applesoft BASIC]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/a2_Bomb_Alley_19xx_SSI_RDOS BombAlley source code] on [[archive.org]]</ref> Grigsby developed both games while working full-time for the [[United States Department of Defense]].

Grigsby and SSI followed ''Bomb Alley'' with ''[[North Atlantic '86]]'' (1983), made with the same engine.

== Description ==
Each turn represented twelve hours, with ground and air combat taking place only during daytime turns.

Grigsby expanded the game from ''[[Guadalcanal Campaign (video game)|Guadalcanal Campaign]]'' with many new features, such as [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]], [[torpedo boat]]s, and the ability to use [[paratroop]]s once per game. Most important of all was the ability of aircraft to support ground troops in combat.

As in the previous game, an AI "player" was available for one side only, but this time it was [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]].  [[The Axis]] had to have a human player. Also in contrast, there were only three scenarios instead of six, and the "long" campaign game ran less than three months.

Both sides faced the problem of how to keep their forces supplied, primarily with ship [[convoy]]s, and how best to disrupt the other side's convoys. Where to base the fighters and bombers, which had been obvious in ''Guadalcanal Campaign'', was now a challenge. Control of the air over [[Africa]] had to be traded off with the air battles over [[Malta]].

==Development==
''Bomb Alley'' was designed by [[Gary Grigsby]], following his debut title ''[[Guadalcanal Campaign]]'' in 1982. As with his first game, he developed ''Bomb Alley'' in his spare time while working in a [[civil service]] position.<ref name=wargamer>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220105733/http://www.wargamer.com/article/1383/Interview-Joel-Billings-and-Gary-Grigsby?page=1 | url=http://www.wargamer.com/article/1383/Interview-Joel-Billings-and-Gary-Grigsby?page=1 | title=Interview: Joel Billings and Gary Grigsby | date=July 16, 2003 | work=[[Wargamer (website)|Wargamer]] | author1=Zabek, Jim | author2=Wallace, Shaun | archivedate=February 20, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Reception==
Rich Sutton of ''Video Games'' wrote that he "highly recommended [''Bomb Alley''] for the intermediate player".<ref name=videogames>{{cite magazine | author=Sutton, Rich | title=War Games: A Battle Plan for Attacking Video Simulations | volume=2 | number=1 | date=October 1993 | magazine=Video Games | pages=40, 41, 44–48 }}</ref>

The game's greatest weakness was the scoring system, which strongly favored the [[United Kingdom|British]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} While Malta and [[Tobruk]] were worth 500 points each if the Allies held them, the Axis received only 200 points each for capturing them.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The only high-value target for the Axis was capturing [[Alexandria]] itself. This meant the Axis had to win decisively or not at all.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Another problem was the limited types of aircraft available.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Historically, the Mediterranean Theatre had a wide mix of German, Italian, British, and American bombers and fighters.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Grigsby's system accommodated only one fighter type for each side, and only a few bomber types.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} A 1983 review in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' complained about this lack of detail, which may have contributed to ''Bomb Alley'' selling less well than ''Guadalcanal Campaign''.<ref name="CGW11">{{cite magazine |last=Karr |first=Richard Charles |title=Bomb Alley: A Review and Analysis |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jul–Aug 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=35–37 |url=}}</ref> A 1993 survey in the magazine of wargames gave the game one-plus stars out of five.<ref name="brooks199309">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=110 | title=Brooks' Book of Wargames: 1900-1950, A-P | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1993| accessdate=30 July 2014 | author=Brooks, M.

There were some bugs in the [[source code]], but they did not interfere with the playability of the game.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} A line of code accidentally carried over from ''Guadalcanal Campaign'' halved the accuracy of the British [[torpedo bomber]]s from what the manual said.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} However, they were still able to inflict serious losses on Axis ships.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Another bug prevented the major Allied base at [[Gibraltar]] from receiving additional supplies, but there was a stockpile at the start large enough to last through most games.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
