{{nihongo|'''''Flappy'''''|フラッピー|Furappī}} is a [[puzzle video game]] by [[DB-SOFT|dB-Soft]] in the same vein as the ''[[Eggerland]]'' series and ''[[Sokoban]]'' that is obscure outside [[Japan]]. It stars Flappy, a somewhat mole-like character who must complete each level by pushing a blue stone from its starting place to the blue tile destination.

Flappy first appeared on the [[Sharp X1]] home computer in 1983. This debut was soon followed by conversions to a number of popular Japanese computers in the early 1980s, including the NEC's line of PCs and the [[Fujitsu]] FM series. Ports for the [[MSX]] computer line and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] were released in 1985.<ref>[http://www.famicomworld.com/Family_Computer/Games.htm Famicom Games] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708195127/http://www.famicomworld.com/Family_Computer/Games.htm |date=2007-07-08 }}, Famicom World.</ref> dB-Soft produced a sequel with more difficult puzzles called ''King Flappy'' for the benefit of anyone who managed to clear the original 200 levels (or "sides" or "scenes" as the game calls them). A [[Game Boy|Nintendo Game Boy]] port was released exclusively in Japan in 1990 and was published by [[Victor Entertainment|Victor Musical Industries]].<ref>[http://www.gamekult.com/tout/jeux/fiches/J000078040.html Flappy Special], Gamekult.com.</ref>

==Plot==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2007}}

The beautiful [[planet]] of Blue Star, home-planet to a young boy named FLAPPY, is invaded by Dark Emperor Ngalo-Ngolo. The proud inhabitants of Blue Star, wanting neither war nor the invasion, self-destruct along with the planet on a path of self-determination. FLAPPY, however, is boarded onto an escape capsule headed for neighboring Planet Seviras by his father and so survives. From his capsule he sees fragments of the exploded Blue Star rain down incessantly on Planet Seviras.

Wandering aimlessly about Planet Seviras, FLAPPY reaches an oasis where he suddenly hears a voice from the sky saying, 'Gather up the fragments of Blue Star, the Blue Stones, to this Blue Area. When all of them have been gathered...' FLAPPY, believing a miracle has just occurred, begins on a journey to gather all the Blue Stones.

==Gameplay==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}

Gravity, gaps in the floors, and wandering enemies stand in the way of Flappy reaching his goal. Flappy can pick up and throw sleeping [[mushroom]]s at the enemies to knock them out for a while, or drop stones on them to crush them permanently. There are, however, many obstacles along the way: brick walls you must work your way around, brown stones which you can crush but which can also crush you if they fall on you, holes or dead angles in which the blue stone becomes irretrievable if it falls into them, and moving enemies. The game features two enemies: Unicorns and Ebira. [[Unicorn]]s are green creatures that move in mostly-repetitive horizontal patterns. [[Ebirah|Ebira]] are red [[crab]]-like enemies (the word "ebi" is a Japanese term for [[shellfish]]) that relentlessly chase Flappy both horizontally and vertically. Ebira tend to mimic Flappy's movements, so Flappy must be careful to avoid being charged by a persistent Ebira.
