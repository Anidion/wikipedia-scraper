'''''TX-1''''' is an arcade [[Racing video game|racing]] [[Sim racing|simulation game]] developed by Tatsumi and released in 1983.<ref>[http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=5911 TX-1], The Arcade Flyer Archive, [[Killer List of Videogames]]</ref> It was licensed to [[Namco]],<ref name=TX-1/> who in turn licensed it to [[Atari, Inc.]] for release in the United States,<ref name=TX-1/> thus the game is considered a successor to ''[[Pole Position]]'' and ''[[Pole Position II]]''.<ref name=TX-1/> It was also released in the United Kingdom, Ireland and mainland Europe via Atari Ireland.

''TX-1'' placed a greater emphasis on realistic [[Sim racing|simulation racing]] than previous games in the genre, with details such as forcing players to brake or downshift the gear during corners to avoid the risk of losing control, and let go of the accelerator when going into a skid in order to regain control of the steering. It was also the first car driving game to use [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] technology, which caused the steering wheel to vibrate, and the game also featured a unique three-screen arcade display for a more [[2.5D|three-dimensional]] perspective of the track. It also introduced [[nonlinear gameplay]] by allowing players to choose which path to drive through after each checkpoint, eventually leading to one of eight possible [[Multiple endings|final destinations]].<ref name=TX-1>{{KLOV game|id=10004|name=TX-1}}</ref>

A sequel, ''TX-1 V8'', was released in 1984. Both ''TX-1'' and its sequel were highly successful in Japan, where they were the top-grossing upright/cockpit [[arcade cabinet]]s for a combined sixteen months between 1983 and 1985. The sequel was not licensed by Atari for North American release.

==Gameplay==
[[File:TX-1 Arcade Title Screen.png|thumb|The player about to pass an opponent.]]
Gameplay is similar to ''Pole Position'', in that the player, piloting a [[Formula One]] racecar, needs to reach a [[check point]] in a certain period of time in order to continue playing. While negotiating the course, the driver needs to exercise caution in the turns, as excessive speed will cause the car to skid; additionally, the driver needs to pass slower cars carefully to avoid a fiery crash.

Unlike ''Pole Position'', each stage ends at a branch point; depending on which way the driver turns, the course will be substantially different. The final two stages of this five-stage game were based upon famous Formula One races of the time and are identified by the name of the country; the path chosen during the previous three stages determines which "races" can be run in the final two stages. ''TX-1'' was a pioneer in this style of play, which would be copied by myriad other games, especially [[Sega]]'s successful ''[[Out Run]]'' series.

==Development==
Though ''TX-1'' uses [[raster graphics]] similar to the 1982 release ''[[Pole Position]]'', developed by Namco and published by Atari, ''TX-1'' uses a unique surround-style, [[Arcade cabinet#Sit-down cabinets|sit-down]] three-screen display. In this design, the primary monitor is mounted directly in front of the steering wheel and secondary monitors, angled at thirty degrees, are mounted both to the left and the right of the primary monitor. At the top of the left monitor is a display of the score and the car's current position; at the top of the right monitor is a running total of cars passed during the race. A display of stage, speed, and time remaining is at the top of the primary screen. The immense size of the cabinet limited the number of [[video arcade|arcades]] which could display this game.

==Reception==
''Game Machine'' listed ''TX-1'' as Japan's top-grossing upright/cockpit [[arcade cabinet]] of [[1983 in video games|December 1983]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=226 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press]] |date=December 15, 1983 |page=33 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19831215p.pdf#page=17}}</ref> ''TX-1'' continued to top the Japanese upright/cockpit arcade charts for six months [[1984 in video games|into 1984]], through January,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=227|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 January 1984|page=37|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840101p.pdf#page=19}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=228|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 January 1984|page=31|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840115p.pdf#page=16}}</ref> February,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=229|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 February 1984|page=29|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840201p.pdf#page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=230|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 February 1984|page=27|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840215p.pdf#page=14}}</ref> March<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=231|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 March 1984|page=29|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840301p.pdf#page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=232|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 March 1984|page=31|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840315p.pdf#page=16}}</ref> and April<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=233|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 April 1984|page=27|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840401p.pdf#page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=234|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 April 1984|page=29|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840415p.pdf#page=15}}</ref> up until May.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine |issue=235|publisher=Amusement Press|date=1 May 1984|page=29|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840501p.pdf#page=15}}</ref> It was later Japan's tenth highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade game during the [[1986 in video games|latter half of 1986]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '86 下半期 |trans-title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: Second Half '86 |magazine=Game Machine |issue=300 |publisher=Amusement Press, Inc. |date=15 January 1987 |page=16 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19870115p.pdf#page=9}}</ref>
