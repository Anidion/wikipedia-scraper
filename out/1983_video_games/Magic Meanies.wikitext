The player, Meltec the Wizard, digs tunnels to collect lumps of lead. To progress to the next screen, Meltec must also collect a wandering cherry and avoid roaming enemies. There are also apples embedded in the earth. Undermining these and allowing them to fall onto an enemy can kill it, or at least block a path.<ref name="crash3">{{cite journal |date=April 1984 |title=Living Guide... |journal=[[CRASH (magazine)|Crash]] |issue=3 |pages=68}}</ref>

''[[Sinclair User]]'' awarded only 3 out of 10.<ref>{{cite journal |date=March 1984 |title=Magic Meanies review |journal=Sinclair User |issue=24 |pages=10 |quote = Magic Meanies ranks as one of the poorer pieces of machine-coded software and has little to commend it}}</ref> ''[[Your Spectrum]]'' gave a score of 23 out of 30, describing it as one of the better games of this type.<ref>{{cite journal |date=May 1984 |title=Magic Meanies review |journal=Your Spectrum |issue=3 |pages=69 |quote=There are already a few games of this type, but this is one of the better ones. Nine speed levels are included, and these begin quite easily, increasing to a level where a high degree of manual dexterity is required.}}</ref>
