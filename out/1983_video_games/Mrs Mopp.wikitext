==Gameplay==
[[Image: MrsMoppZXSpectrumTitleScreen.gif|thumb|left|Title screen]]

The screen represents a kitchen which Mrs. Mopp moves around. Dirt, cups, glasses and clothes accumulate on the floor, blocking her progress. She must pick up one of the appropriately coloured tools around the room (basket, tray, or dustpan and brush) and use it to collect the mess.  When the character sprite flashes, the tool must be emptied into the appropriate part of the kitchen (washing machine, sink, or bin).

When Mrs. Mopp gets tired, she can revive herself by having a swig of sherry, but care must be taken not to drink too much, or Mrs. Mopp will become first tipsy (reversed controls), then drunk (random movement).

==Reception==
''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' gave ''Mrs Mopp'' a score of 69% in the magazine's first issue.<ref name='crashreview'>{{Cite web|url=http://crashonline.org.uk/03/lguide13.htm|title=CRASH 3 - Arcade Miscellaneous|website=Crashonline.org.uk}}</ref>
