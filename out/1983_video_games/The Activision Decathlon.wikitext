==Reception==
Shortly after release, Activision's ''Decathlon'' drew comparisons to [[Konami]]'s popular arcade game [[Track & Field (video game)|''Hyper Olympic'' (''Track & Field'')]], which was introduced at the [[Amusement Machine Show]] a month later in September 1983. According to ''[[Cash Box]]'' magazine, several people claimed there were "cursory similarities" between the two games.<ref name="JAMMA">{{cite magazine |title="Somber" JAMMA Show Hosts Five Laser Disc Games |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=October 15, 1983 |pages=32, 34 |url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox45unse_18/page/45}}</ref>

The Atari 2600 version of ''Decathlon'' was reviewed by ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine in its "Arcade Alley" column where it was described as "an absolute triumph of imaginative programming" and as "a masterwork".<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kunkel |first1=Bill |author-link1=Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2=Katz |first2=Arnie |author-link2=Arnie Katz|date=December 1983 |title=Arcade Alley: Super Gifts for Gamers |magazine=[[Video (magazine)|Video]] |publisher=Reese Communications |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=28–9 |issn=0147-8907|url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/articles/arcade_alley/arcade_alley_dec83.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|28}} ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' rated the VCS version 92% while giving the ColecoVision version a 93% score.<ref name="CVG">{{cite journal |title=Complete Games Guide |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref>

In 1985, the game appeared at number-two on the Atari 8-bit chart in the United Kingdom.<ref name="CG5">{{cite magazine |title=Gallup Chart |magazine=[[Computer Gamer]] |date=August 1985 |issue=5 |page=10 |publisher=[[Argus Press]] |location=United Kingdom |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_05_1985-08_Argus_Press_GB/page/n9}}</ref>
