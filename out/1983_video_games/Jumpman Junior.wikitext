'''''Jumpman Junior''''' is a [[platform game]] written by Randy Glover and published by [[Epyx]] in 1983 for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and [[Commodore 64]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dillon|first1=Roberto|title=Ready: A Commodore 64 Retrospective|date=3 December 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789812873415|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecuoBQAAQBAJ&q=Jumpman+Junior|accessdate=29 August 2016|language=en}}</ref> In 1984, a port was released for [[ColecoVision]] in Australia, France, Germany, Italy and the UK.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}} It is a follow-up to ''[[Jumpman (video game)|Jumpman]]'' (1983). While ''Jumpman'' has 30 levels, ''Jumpman Junior'' has 12–all of which are different from the previous game. The game was reduced in scope so it could be released in cartridge form.

''Jumpman Junior'' has the same gameplay as ''[[Jumpman (video game)|Jumpman]]'' but with new levels. The goal is to disarm the bombs before they explode. To reach the bombs the player must navigate up platforms, ladders, and ropes by jumping and climbing.<ref name=HVG>{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Brett|title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984: A Complete Reference Guide|date=20 December 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786487554|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&dq=Jumpman+Junior&pg=PA182|accessdate=29 August 2016|language=en}}</ref> Each level has a different theme and different obstacles. There are 12 levels and 8 game speeds.<ref name=HVG/>

==Reception==
''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' liked the "excellent" graphics, and faulted it only for the way it started over from the beginning after losing a life.<ref name="antic198403">{{Cite magazine |last=Faughn |first=David |date=March 1984 |title=Product Reviews |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v2n12/productreviews.html |magazine=Antic}}</ref>
''[[Electronic Games]]'' started its review by calling the original ''Jumpman'' "a genuine classic" with levels that were "a coherently-written collection of some of the most interesting play mechanics ever devised." They conclude that the new version is "so good—the playfields are reminiscent of the original, but are all new—that even veteran Jumpmen should check it out."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Jumpman Junior |journal=Electronic Games |date= May 1984 |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-jumpman-junior_2714.html }}</ref>
