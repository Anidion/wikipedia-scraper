'''''Ant Attack''''' is an action game written for the [[ZX Spectrum]] by Sandy White and published by [[Quicksilva]] in 1983. A [[Commodore 64]] version was released in 1984.

While ''[[Zaxxon]]'' and ''[[Q*bert]]'' previously used [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric projection]], ''Ant Attack'' added an extra [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degree of freedom]] (ability to go up and down instead of just north, south, east and west), and it may be the first isometric game for [[personal computers]].<ref name="SW homepage">{{cite web | url=http://sandywhite.co.uk/fun/ants | title=Sandy White - an Ant Attack homepage | author=Sandy White | accessdate=2006-03-28 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060406030246/http://sandywhite.co.uk/fun/ants | archivedate= 6 April 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> The same type of isometric projection was used in Sandy White's later ''[[Zombie Zombie]]''.

==Gameplay==

The player chooses whether to control the character of "Girl" or "Boy",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crashonline.org.uk/01/antattack.htm|title=CRASH 1 - 3D Ant Attack|website=www.crashonline.org.uk}}</ref> who then enters the [[walled city]] of Antescher to rescue the other,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ant-attack-review|title=Ant Attack|first=Chris|last=Wilkins|newspaper=Eurogamer.net |date=Oct 10, 2007}}</ref> who has been captured and immobilised somewhere in the city.

The city is inhabited by giant ants which chase and attempt to bite the player. The player can defend themselves by throwing grenades at the ants, but these can also harm the humans. Once the hostage is rescued, the two must escape the city. The game then starts again with the hostage located in a different, harder-to-reach part of the city.

==Development==
Almost all of the game code was written by hand on paper using [[Assembly language#Opcode mnemonics and extended mnemonics|assembler mnemonics]], then manually [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembled]],<ref name="SW homepage"/> with  the resulting [[hexadecimal]] digits typed sequentially into an external [[EEPROM]] emulator device (aka SoftROM<ref>{{cite web|title=SoftROM mini feature, Issue 2, March 1984|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr02/yr02_35.htm|work=Your Sinclair online archive}}</ref> or "softie") attached to a host Spectrum.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|title=Video interview with Sandy White| date=23 November 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdrgBwSH9W8 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/RdrgBwSH9W8 |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=1 October 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Similarly, the character graphics and other custom sprites were all hand-drawn on squared paper and manually converted to strings of hex data. Additionally, some minor add-on routines such as high score registration were added on to the core game using regular [[Sinclair BASIC]].<ref name="sandywhite.co.uk">{{cite web|title=Comments guestbook with owner's replies, page one|url=http://www.sandywhite.co.uk/fun/visitors/visitors1.htm|work=Sandy White personal homepage|accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref>

The game's setting of "Antescher" is a reference to the artist [[M. C. Escher]].<ref name='ace38antattack' />
