'''''Excalibur''''' is a resource management [[strategy video game]] for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] published in 1983. It was designed by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] and developed with the help of Larry Summers and Valerie Atkinson. Like Crawford's earlier ''[[Eastern Front (1941)]]'', ''Excalibur'' was released through the [[Atari Program Exchange]].

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to unite all of [[Great Britain|Britain]] under the rule of [[King Arthur]]. The players can invade kingdoms, set [[tithe]]s for their [[vassal]]s, send plagues and pestilences (with the help of [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]]) and manage the loyalty of their own [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] by rewarding their knights or, if they grow too disloyal, by banishing them.

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Games]]'' stated that "''Excalibur'' is a grand effort".{{r|forman198401}} ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' stated that the game "easily ranks as the finest programming achievement to date by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] ... one of the richest gaming experiences ever".{{r|duberman198402}} ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1984 called ''Excalibur'' "a magnificent piece of software". It praised the documentation and novella, and concluded by asking, "When will Chris Crawford's next game be published?"{{r|townsend198408}} In 1990, ''CGW'' gave the game four out of five stars, stating that "even on an obsolete machine" ''Excalibur'' was still worthwhile.<ref name="brooks199010">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: Pre-20th Century | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1990 | accessdate=16 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

''The [[Addison-Wesley]] Book of Atari Software 1984'' gave ''Excalibur'' an overall A rating and stated that "those who persevere will find an ample reward in the game's incredible depth". The book predicted, however, that it was "destined to become a cult game ... appeal[ing] mainly to the seasoned wargamer or fantasy role-player" because of the slow pace and difficulty.<ref name="aw1984">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/Atari_Software_1984#page/n22/mode/2up | title=The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software | publisher=Addison-Wesley | year=1984 | pages=22 | isbn=0-201-16454-X |editor1=Stanton, Jeffrey |editor2=Wells, Robert P. |editor3=Rochowansky, Sandra |editor4=Mellid, Michael }}</ref>

Crawford in 1984 wrote "My greatest regret, though, is that Excalibur has not won the attention that I think it deserves. This game is my magnum opus, much grander in scale than anything else I have done. It is a shame that so few people are even aware of its existence."<ref name="crawford198408">{{cite magazine | title=Designer's Notes on Excalibur | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1984 | accessdate=31 October 2013 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&pub=2&id=17 | author=Crawford, Chris | pages=13}}</ref>
