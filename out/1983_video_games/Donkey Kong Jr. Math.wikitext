It was released in Japan in 1983 for the Family Computer, and in North America and the [[PAL region]] in 1986.

It is the only game in the Education Series of NES games in North America, owing to the game's lack of success. It was made available in various forms, including in the 2002 [[GameCube]] video game ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'' and on the [[Virtual Console]] services for [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]] in 2007 and 2014 respectively. ''Donkey Kong Jr. Math'' was a critical and commercial failure. It has received criticism from several publications including [[IGN]] staff, who called it one of the worst Virtual Console games.
