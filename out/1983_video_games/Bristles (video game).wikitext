'''''Bristles''''' is a video game by Fernando Herrera for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published by the company he co-founded, [[First Star Software]], in 1983.<ref name=giantlist/> It was ported to the [[Commodore 64]],<ref name=lemon/> [[ZX Spectrum]],<ref name=spec/> and [[Exidy]]'s Max-A-Flex arcade system.<ref name=ah/> As Peter the Painter, the player uses ladders and elevators move through a cutaway view of a house to paint all the walls.

==Gameplay==

The player controls Peter the Painter with the goal of painting the walls of eight different houses within a time limit.  To move between the different floors Peter can ride an elevator or climb a ladder. If he gets caught in an open elevator shaft, Peter is sent to the bottom of the building.

Dangerous objects that hinder Peter's task include "flying half pints" that knock him down and "dumb buckets" that steal Peter's brush.<ref name=manual/> Later levels add "Brenda the Brat", who leaves handprints all over the freshly painted walls, and the "Bucket Chucker" who never stops chasing Peter. Brenda can be pacified with a candy cane and Bucket Chucker can be temporarily trapped in a paint mixer. 

The player starts with 10 brushes serving as lives and additional two brushes are added after finishing the paint job on every level.

''Bristles'' soundtrack uses arrangements of different pieces from [[Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] [[The_Nutcracker#Tchaikovsky:_The_Nutcracker_Suite,_Op._71a|The Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a]]. The main theme is ''II. Danses caract√©ristiques - a. Marche''. When the player is knocked down, the game reacts with a IIc piece: ''Russian Dance''. When Brenda is ruining freshly painted walls, piece IIe ''Chinese Dance'' is played.

==Reception==
In a review for ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' in 1984, George Adamson wrote: "The game's action is fast and furious. It doesn't get faster in higher levels, though. Instead, ''Bristles'' offers more novel challenges".<ref name=antic/> ''Video Games'' magazine wrote: "As excellent and colorful as the visuals are, the melodies throughout this contest are the real show stoppers."<ref name="vg">{{cite journal |last1=Salamone |first1=Ted |title=Computer Corner: Bristles |journal=Video Games |date=May 1984 |volume=2 |issue=8 |page=80 |url=https://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Volume_2_Number_08_1984-05_Pumpkin_Press_US/page/n79/mode/2up |publisher=Pumpkin Press}}</ref> In a brief review, ''GAMES'' magazine concluded: "There's so much going on, and the action is so fast, that it's easy to get confused; but everything occurs strictly according to patterns that can be memorized. It may take a while to get the hang of this game, but it's a real charmer".<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=GAMES |date=December 1984 |issue=58 |page=56 |title=Computer Capers: Bristles |first=Burt |last1=Hochburg |url=https://archive.org/details/games-58-1984-december/page/56/mode/2up |publisher=Playboy Enterprises}}</ref>

In a 1985 ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' review of reduced price games, [[Andy Eddy]] cautioned, "Many users will find ''Bristles'' too difficult and demanding, as it's a very hard game to master."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eddy |first1=Andy |title=Bargain Bin |journal=ANALOG Computing |date=November 1985 |issue=36 |page=19 |url=https://archive.org/details/analog-computing-magazine-36/page/n19/mode/2up}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 2004, an authorized modification of the Atari 8-bit computer version was released as an [[Atari 5200]] cartridge.<ref>{{cite web |title=Atari 5200 Bristles (First Star Software) |url=https://atariage.com/software_page.php?SystemID=5200&SoftwareID=4048 |website=AtariAge}}</ref>
