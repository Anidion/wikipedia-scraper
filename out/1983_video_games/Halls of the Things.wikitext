'''''Halls of the Things''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Design Design]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and released by [[Crystal Computing]] in 1983. It was ported to the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Commodore 64]]. The player travels through seven floors of a tower, searching for seven rings, with each floor being a complex maze of corridors and rooms. Once the player has the rings they must then find the magical key hidden in the dungeon, which opens the drawbridge allowing the player to escape. To hinder the player's progress they are attacked by "things," but the player is armed with a sword, arrows, fireballs and lightning to aid you in the quest.

The game was re-released by Design Design Software and [[Firebird Software]]. A sequel, ''[[Return of the Things]]'', was released in 1984.
