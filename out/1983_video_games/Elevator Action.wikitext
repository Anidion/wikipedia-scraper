{{nihongo foot|'''''Elevator Action'''''|エレベーターアクション|Erebētā Akushon|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}  is a [[Platform game|platform]] [[shooter game]] released in arcades by [[Taito]] in 1983. The player assumes the role of Agent 17, a spy infiltrating a 30-story building filled with [[elevator]]s and enemy agents who emerge from closed doors. The goal is to collect secret documents from specially marked rooms, then escape the building. It runs on the [[Taito SJ System]] arcade system.

The game was a critical and commercial success for Taito, exceeding sales expectations at the time it released. It was the top-grossing arcade game on the Japanese arcade charts for three months in [[1983 in video games|late 1983]], and was among the top five highest-grossing [[1984 in video games|arcade "route" games of 1984]] in the United States. It has been ported to a variety of home systems, has had multiple sequels, and appeared on Taito compilations.
