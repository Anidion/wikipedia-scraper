{{nihongo foot|'''''Mario's Cement Factory'''''|マリオズ・セメント・ファクトリー<ref name=tanaka />|''Mariozu Semento Fakutorī''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1983 [[LCD game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] under their ''[[Game & Watch]]'' series. It follows earlier ''Mario'' games, like the arcade and Game & Watch versions of ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''. Players control Mario as he navigates elevators and funnels cement through a factory, while trying to prevent the cement from crushing his fellow workers. Two versions of the game were released — a Table Top unit and a handheld game akin to most other Game & Watch titles. Development was headed by [[Nintendo Research and Development 1|Nintendo R&D1]], led by engineer [[Gunpei Yokoi]].

The game has been re-released several times; it was featured as part of ''[[Game Boy Gallery]]'' for the [[Game Boy]], ''[[Game & Watch Gallery 4]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]], and as a digital download for the [[Nintendo DSi]]. It has been described by critics as one of the strangest games in the ''[[Super Mario|Mario]]'' franchise.

==Gameplay==
''Mario's Cement Factory'' puts players in control of Mario, who works at a cement factory where he funnels cement into [[cement truck]]s. Mario must navigate two dangerous elevators and avoid falling or being crushed and losing a [[life (gaming)|life]]. He must also continually empty cement into the trucks, or else the cement will overflow and crush one of the workers below, which costs players a life. There are two game modes: A and B, the latter being faster paced and more difficult.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-DSiWare/Game-Watch-Mario-s-Cement-Factory-263357.html |title=Game & Watch™ Mario's Cement Factory |website=Nintendo of Europe |language=en-GB |access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name="radar" /><ref name = "Wired" />
