During the players take the time to answer, two timers are shown. The timer at the top of the screen is shown as a bar, indicating the total time of the current question. The timer at the bottom of the screen consists of four digits and indicates the score the players get when they answer a question correctly. When the timer reaches zero in single-player mode, the player receives no score and the game moves on to the next question. In the two-player mode, the winner is displayed before the option to play again is presented.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Teverbaugh |first=Rick |title=Electronic Games - Volume 02 Number 17 |publisher=Electronic Games |year=1984 |volume=2 |page=48 |language=en}}</ref>
