'''''Traxx''''' is a [[List of maze video games|maze game]] released in 1983 by [[Quicksilva]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] (48K) and [[VIC-20]] (+8K). The gameplay is similar to ''[[Amidar]]'',<ref name="llamasoft">{{cite web|title=8-bit games|url=http://www.llamasoft.co.uk/lc-8bit.php|website=Llamasoft}}</ref> where the goal is to color all of the lines on a grid of equally-sized squares. Unlike ''[[Amidar]]'', the sections of the grid are not captured when surrounded; the goal is purely to color all of the lines.

== Gameplay ==
The player moves along a rectangular grid painting all of its sections. The level ends when the entire grid has been painted. Various enemies also inhabit the grid and will try to kill the player.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr01/yr01_47.htm|title = Your Spectrum 01 - SpectrumSoft}}</ref>
