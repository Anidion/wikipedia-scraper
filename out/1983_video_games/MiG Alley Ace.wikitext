==Reception==
David Patton reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "While this game lacks too many features to be called a true flight simulator (it has no attitude indicator, no "weather problems", no runways, no player control over ailerons and rudders, etc. . .), the excellent aerial dogfight action and Korean war setting make it worthy purchase for both the war gamer who is looking for a good arcade experience and for the arcader who is ready to go to war."<ref name="CGW16">{{cite magazine |last=Patton |first=David |title=Mig Alley Ace |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=June 1984 |volume=1 |issue=16 |pages=17, 40}}</ref>

In 1996, ''Computer Gaming World'' declared ''MiG Alley Ace'' the 129th-best computer game ever released.<ref name="cgw150">{{cite magazine |author= |date=November 1996 |title=150 Best (and 50 Worst) Games of All Time |url=https://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_148.pdf |url-status=bot: unknown |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=148 |pages=63–65, 68, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 94, 98 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531042948/https://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_148.pdf |archive-date=31 May 2023 |access-date=6 June 2023 }}</ref>
