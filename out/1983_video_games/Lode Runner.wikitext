'''''Lode Runner''''' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[puzzle-platform game]], developed by [[Douglas E. Smith|Doug Smith]] and published by [[Broderbund]] in 1983. Its gameplay mechanics are similar to ''[[Space Panic]]'' from 1980. The player controls a character who must collect all the gold pieces in a level and get to the end while being chased by a number of enemies. It is one of the first games to include a [[level editor]].

After the original game, a number of remakes, spin-offs and sequels were published in the [[Lode Runner#Legacy|''Lode Runner'' series]] for different computers and consoles by different developers and publishers.

[[File:Lode Runner.jpg|thumb|left|Apple II screenshot]]

The player controls a [[stick figure]] who must collect all the gold in a [[Level (video games)|level]] while avoiding guards who try to catch the player. After collecting all the gold, the player must reach the top of the screen to reach the next level. There are 150 levels in the game, which progressively challenge players' problem-solving abilities or reaction times.<ref name=gameplay>{{cite news|url=http://kotaku.com/5936566/nearly-thirty-years-old-and-lode-runner-is-still-kicking-my-ass|title=Nearly Thirty Years Old, and ''Lode Runner'' Is Still Kicking My [Butt]|author=Mike Fahey|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=21 August 2012|access-date=21 September 2015}}</ref>

Levels have a multi-story, brick platform motif, with [[ladder]]s and suspended [[hand-to-hand bar]]s that offer multiple ways to travel. Guards can pick up gold bars by running over them, but any individual guard may carry no more than one bar at a time. The player can dig holes into floors to temporarily trap guards and may safely walk atop any who have fallen into holes. Should a guard be carrying a bar of gold when he falls into a hole, he will drop it and the player can pick it up. Holes dug by the player fill themselves in after a short delay. A trapped guard who cannot escape a hole before it fills is consumed, immediately respawning in a random location at the top of the level. Unlike guards, the player's character may not climb up out of a hole, and he will be killed if it fills before he can escape by other means. Floors may contain [[trapdoor]]s, through which the player and guards will fall, and [[bedrock]], through which the player cannot dig.

The player can dig a hole only to either side of his position and may not dig directly beneath his own feet. In order to dig through multiple layers of bricks, the player must create a gap whose width is at least equal to the number of layers. However, exceptions to this rule arise when the player digs from the position of standing on a ladder, or hanging from a hand-to-hand bar, which allows the player to repeatedly dig and descend one row. This kind of digging is involved in solving many of the levels.

The player starts with five [[life (gaming)|lives]]; each level completion awards an extra life. Should a guard catch the player, one life is subtracted, and the current level restarts. The player's character can fall from arbitrary heights without any injury but cannot [[jumping|jump]], and players can trap themselves in pits from which the only escape is to abort the level, costing a life, and begin again.

===Enemy AI===
[[Image:Lode Runner enemies.gif|thumb|While the player's character's position changes, enemies tend to move alternatively, moving away from Lode Runner.]]

The guards do not always take the shortest path to the player and can move in counterintuitive ways. Sometimes, when the player and a guard are on the same ladder, for instance, the guard will move away from the player. In general, depending on their exact positioning relative to Lode Runner, the guards sometimes appear to be repelled. Mastering the game involves developing the intuition to predict the movement of the guards.

===Permitted contact===
The player may come into contact with a guard directly from above, with the stick figure's feet touching the guard's head. This is what enables the player to walk over guards who are temporarily stuck in a hole that has been dug. It is also possible to make this contact while both the guard and the player are in free fall, since the player not only runs faster than the guards, but also falls faster; moreover, it is possible to survive the feet-to-head contact while a guard is standing on a platform and begins to move. Both forms of contact are necessary to solve some levels. Sometimes it is necessary to liberate a trapped guard by digging while standing on his head but then moving rapidly in the opposite direction when the guard begins marching to freedom. In a few levels, it is necessary to use a falling guard as a bridge to reach an otherwise unreachable area. One subtlety is that if a down movement is initiated while standing on a guard's head, or briefly touching the guard's head during free fall, the consequences are fatal.

===Trapping and using guards===
In some levels, guards can be deliberately trapped in various ways. For instance, they can be lured into entering a part of the level from which there is no escape. In some situations, the player can liberate trapped guards by digging them out. In some levels, the player must exploit the guards by having them collect gold pieces which are positioned such that whoever collects them will become trapped. When the guard collects the piece and becomes trapped, the player can release the guard and then later steal the gold when the guard drops it or falls into a hole.

In some levels, there are gold pieces which can be collected only by killing guards by digging holes to trap them. Deceased guards come back to life from locations near the top of the screen, which may allow them to reach parts of the level that cannot be reached by the player.

===Traversal orders===
Some levels require careful ordering of traversal, because they are divided into zones connected by passages which are impossible to traverse in the reverse direction. If a gold piece remains in an unreachable zone, the player may have to abort the level to start again, losing a life, unless there is a way to coax a guard into bringing the gold.

===Timing===
Some of the game's puzzles in the advanced levels are time-sensitive. The player must dig in order to penetrate the interior of some cavern to collect gold, and quickly return the same way before the digging repairs itself, enclosing Lode Runner in that cavern with no means of escape.

Some puzzles require deliberate timing among the digging actions because Lode Runner must run over previously dug-out tiles that have just repaired themselves, while having enough time to pass through ones which have not yet repaired.

==Development==
Around late 1980, high school student James Bratsanos heard from a friend about a new [[arcade video game]], ''[[Space Panic]]'' by [[Universal Entertainment|Universal]], which involves climbing platforms and ladders while digging holes to trap monsters. Bratsanos was intrigued by his friend's description of the concept, and he wanted to develop it further. He began writing a [[Commodore PET]] program, called ''Suicide'', using simple text-based graphics. Due to his lack of programming experience, there were no pre-programmed levels, but he instead built "an engine that could interpret a game level and then run a processing loop on the monsters". This novel design later evolved into the concept of a level editor.<ref name="Retro">{{cite magazine |last1=Grannell |first1=Craig |title=Lode Runner |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |date=January 2013 |issue=111 |pages=20–7 |url=https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____111}}</ref><ref name="Maher">{{cite web |last1=Maher |first1=Jimmy |title=Lode Runner |url=https://www.filfre.net/2020/12/lode-runner/ |website=The Digital Antiquarian |date=December 18, 2020 |access-date=20 April 2021}}</ref>

At the [[University of Washington]] in 1981, Bratsanos met two other students, [[architecture]] student [[Douglas E. Smith]] and Tracy Steinbeck. Following the release of [[Nintendo]]'s arcade platformer ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' that year, the three students began working on a program called ''Kong'', which evolved the concepts of ''Suicide''. Bratsanos later left the project to pursue his studies, and Smith continued to develop ''Kong''<ref name="Maher"/><ref name="Retro"/> into the prototype of what later became ''Lode Runner''.<ref name = "IGN_interview">{{cite news | date =1999-02-17| work= [[IGN]] | title = Lock'n'Lode | url = http://ign64.ign.com/articles/066/066952p1.html}}</ref> ''Kong'' was written for a [[Prime Computer|Prime Computer 550]] [[minicomputer]] limited to one building on the UW campus. ''Kong'' was soon [[porting|ported]] to [[VAX]] minicomputers, which had more terminals available on campus. The game was programmed in [[Fortran]] using [[ASCII art|ASCII character graphics]]. When ''Kong'' was ported to the VAX, some [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] sections were mixed into the original Fortran code.<ref name=Douglas-death>{{cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/09/13/lode-runner-creator-douglas-e-smith-passes-away/|title=''Lode Runner'' Creator Douglas E. Smith Passes Away|author=Thomas Schulenberg|website=[[Engadget]]|date=13 September 2014|access-date=7 August 2015}}</ref>

Over one weekend in 1982, Smith recreated a crude, playable version in [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] [[assembly language]] on an [[Apple II series|Apple II+]] and renamed the game ''Miner''. Through the end of the year, he refined that version, which was black-and-white with no [[joystick]] support. He submitted a rough version to [[Broderbund]] around October 1982 and received a one-line rejection letter in response to the effect of "Thank you for submitting your game concept. Unfortunately, it does not fit within our product line."<ref name = "IGN_interview" />

''Miner'', like its text-based ''Kong'' predecessors, had only simple animation where characters move across the screen in block increments. It was too primitive for an acceptable commercial product as Broderbund wanted detailed pixel-level movement.<ref name = "Ancient_History_Usenet" >{{cite web| date =1991-04-07| title = Loderunner: Ancient History! (Usenet posting to rec.games.programmer) | url = http://entropymine.com/jason/lr/misc/ldhist.html}}</ref> Smith's new game would be one of the first to include a [[level editor]] for [[user generated content]], allowing players to create [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] for the game.<ref name="Honoring the Code"/> Smith was given a $10,000 advance by Broderbund to develop the inter-square animation and to provide 150 levels of play. In a 2010 interview, [[game designer]] [[John Romero]] claimed that Smith added the level-editing function at the request of neighborhood kids he had testing the game, and "a ton" of the levels they designed ended up in the final game.<ref name="Honoring the Code">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=opLCzUsjRowC&pg=PA7 | title=Honoring the Code: Conversations with Great Game Designers | publisher=CRC Press | last=Barton |first=Matt | date=2010 | page=7 | isbn=978-1466567535}}</ref> Smith borrowed money to purchase a color monitor and joystick and continued to improve the game. Around Christmas of 1982, he submitted the game, renamed ''Lode Runner'', to four [[video game publisher|publishers]] and received offers from all four: [[Sierra Online|Sierra]], [[Sirius Software|Sirius]], [[Eclectic Games|Synergistic]], and Broderbund. He took the deal with Broderbund.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

''Lode Runner'' was originally released on June 23, 1983.<ref name="Copyright">{{cite web |title=Lode Runner (Registration Number PA0000226732) |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov |website=[[United States Copyright Office]] |access-date=1 June 2021}}</ref> The original [[microcomputer]] versions were for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[VIC-20]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[IBM PC compatible]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Software Catalog For Apple, Atari, IBM PC, Commodore 64, and VIC-20 |chapter=Compatibility Chart |year=1983 |publisher=Broderbund Software |pages=8–9 |url=http://www.atarimania.com/catalog-atari-broderbund-software-_196_8.html |access-date=2015-02-08}}</ref> The VIC-20 version was released on cartridge, including the level editor. The Commodore 64 had both a disk and cartridge release, with the latter having 32 levels. The IBM PC port was originally on a [[self-booting disk]] and is incompatible with video cards other than [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} A 1986 MS-DOS release runs on any video card.

The [[Famicom]] version was released by [[Hudson Soft]] in 1984 (North American [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] release in 1986) and became one of the earliest third-party games made for that system. It has 50 levels, scrolling screens, added music, and graphics redone in a more cartoon-like style. In addition, fruits and vegetables randomly appear which may be grabbed for additional points. A level editor was included, which in Japan used the Famicom's Family BASIC tape drive to save one's work; however, as with many US localisations, the NES lacked the tape drive and thus there is no way to save levels created with the US release.

An [[Arcade video game|arcade]] version of ''Lode Runner'' was produced by [[Irem]] in 1984. It was notably the first time an American computer game was adapted into a Japanese arcade game.<ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine |last=Adams |first=Roe R. |date=September 1985 |title=Come Cast A Spell With Me |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_5.4/page/n20 |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |pages=21, 33 |volume=4 |issue=3}}</ref> It had some added features like the ability to hang off the ends of ladders and an improved enemy AI.

Other versions include those for the [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum]], a licensed version for [[MSX]] published by [[ASCII Corporation]], [[SG-1000]], [[Windows 3.1x]], and [[Game Boy]].

Broderbund released an enhanced version, ''[[Championship Lode Runner]]'', in 1985, with 50 levels and a higher difficulty. The company offered a commemorative certificate to anyone who could submit proof of having beaten the game (and submitted proof of purchase to show that their copy of the game was not pirated). It was ported to the Apple, Atari, C64, MSX, and IBM PC, as well as the NES (although that version did not reach North America).

The Atari 8-bit version of ''Lode Runner'' was converted to cartridge and re-released by [[Atari Corporation]] in 1987, as one of the series of releases for the [[Atari XEGS]] console. This version contains all 150 levels and the level editor, which requires a disk drive.

''[[Ahoy!]]'' in 1984 called the game "a top-notch action game that requires both a quick mind and an agile joystick".

===Arcade===
In 1984, [[Irem]] developed an arcade conversion of ''Lode Runner''.<ref>{{cite web |url        =http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8441| title =Lode Runner| publisher =The International Arcade Museum |access-date =5 Oct 2013}}</ref> It contains 24 remixed levels from the 150 original levels. Irem brought many of its arcade-inspired levels to the Famicom Disk System with the names ''Super Lode Runner'' and ''Super Lode Runner II''. In Japan, ''[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]'' listed ''Lode Runner'' on their August 1, 1984 issue as being the most successful [[table arcade cabinet]] of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=241|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 August 1984|page=27|lang=ja}}</ref> The arcade version has numerous sequels, including these:

* ''Lode Runner: The Bungeling Strikes Back'' (1984), selecting 30 levels based on the original game developed for the arcade. The gameplay is almost exactly the same (save the addition of a two-player mode) and the only heavy modification was the graphics and advancement to a 512-color palette. In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Lode Runner: The Bungeling Strikes Back'' on their March 1, 1985 issue as the seventh most successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=255|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 March 1985|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>
* ''Lode Runner: Majin No Fukkatsu'' (1985), also known as ''Lode Runner: The Golden Labyrinth'', developed by Irem. In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed it on their December 15, 1985 issue as the top-grossing table arcade unit during that month.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=15 December 1985|title=Best Hit Games 25|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19851215p.pdf#page=13|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|issue=273|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref> It went on to be Japan's ninth highest-grossing table arcade game during the [[1986 in video games|first half of 1986]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '86 上半期 |trans-title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: First Half '86 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=288 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=15 July 1986 |page=28 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19860715p.pdf#page=15}}</ref>

===1990s===
* ''Lode Runner: The Lost Labyrinth'', 1990 updated version for the [[PC Engine|TurboGrafx-16]] featuring all 150 levels of the 1983 set.
* ''[[Lode Runner: The Legend Returns]]'', a 1994 Sierra incarnation of the original game with enhanced graphics and tools.
* ''[[Lode Runner Online: The Mad Monks' Revenge]]'', the 1995 [[Video game remake|remake]] which replaced all the elements of the previous plus new online play.
* ''[[Lode Runner 2]]'' (1998), a game with isometric 3D gameplay.
* ''[[Lode Runner (1998 video game)|Lode Runner]]'' (1998), a compilation game for PlayStation, which includes ''Lode Runner: The Legend Returns'' and ''Lode Runner Extra''.
* ''[[Lode Runner 3-D]]'' (1999) for the [[Nintendo 64]].

Several versions of ''Lode Runner'' were not released in the U.S., such as ''Lode Runner Twin'' and ''Power Lode Runner'' (1999, [[Super Famicom|SFC]]), which vary gameplay, mostly by adding different characters and scenarios. Another title, ''[[Battle Lode Runner]]'', was originally exclusive to Japan, but made available on 23 April 2007 as the first Japan-only game to appear on [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2007/04/battle_lode_run/|title=''Battle Lode Runner'' First Japan-Only Retro Game on U.S. Virtual Console|author=Chriskohler|magazine=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|date= 23 April 2007|access-date=9 August 2015}}</ref> The original ''Lode Runner'' followed in June 2007.

The [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version, developed by [[Hudson Soft]], marked the first appearance of [[Bomberman|Bombermen]] as the opposing robots.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/seemingly-unrelated-games-you-probably-didnt-know-were-set-same-universe/|title=Seemingly Unrelated Games [Which] You Probably Didn't Know Were Set in the Same Universe|author=David Houghton|website=[[GamesRadar+]]|date=23 November 2012|access-date=8 August 2015}}</ref> The end screen to ''[[Bomberman (1983 video game)|Bomberman]]'' for the NES notes that the original White Bomberman has turned human and hints at his appearance in another game, with the Lode Runner behind him. In the Japanese version, the reference is more direct: "Congratulations - Bomber Man becomes Runner - See you again in Lode Runner".

In Japan, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] version of ''Lode Runner'' allows editing and creating levels to share with friends using a [[Famicom Data Recorder]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/27929/nintendos-expansion-ports-famicom-basic-and-data-recorder | first=Danny | last=Bivens | work=Nintendo World Report | date=October 26, 2011 | title=Famicom BASIC and Data Recorder - Feature | access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>
