{{nihongo|'''''Champion Baseball'''''|チャンピオン ベースボール}} is an [[arcade game|arcade]] [[List of baseball video games|baseball video game]] developed by [[ADK (company)|Alpha Denshi]] and published by [[Sega]] in [[1983 in video gaming|March 1983]].<ref name="Copyright">{{cite web |title=Champion Baseball (Registration Number PA0000195229) |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov |website=[[United States Copyright Office]] |access-date=9 May 2021}}</ref><ref name="Famitsu">{{cite book |chapter=1983 |title=Sega Arcade History |date=2002 |series=[[Famitsu DC]] |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |page=47 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/segaarcadehistoryfamitsudc/page/n48 |language=ja}}</ref> It was a sophisticated [[sports video game]] for its time, displaying a split-screen format, with the [[playfield]] viewed from two camera angles, one from the outfield and another close-up shot of the batter and pitcher, while giving players the option of selecting relief pitchers or pinch hitters and with an umpire looking on attentively to make the game calls.<ref name="eg_baseball"/><ref>{{KLOV game|2728|Champion Baseball}}</ref> The game also had digitized voices for the umpire,<ref name="Champion"/> and individual player statistics.<ref name="Famitsu"/><ref name="Champion"/> A person could play for hours with one token providing they tied scores at the 9th and further innings.

The game was a blockbuster success in Japanese [[Amusement arcade|arcades]] when released in 1983, and was a departure from the "[[Shoot 'em up|space games]]" and "cartoon" [[action games]] that had previously dominated the arcades. It went on to serve as the prototype for later baseball video games. [[Nintendo]], for example, released their own competitor ''[[Baseball (1983 video game)|Baseball]]'' later the same year.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a [[baseball]] team, against a computer-controlled team, with the player batting at the top of each [[inning (baseball)|inning]]. In a two-player game, each will play independently against the computer, one inning at a time. Standard baseball rules apply, with the player awarded points for various accomplishments such as hitting a pitch, safely reaching any base, pitching a strike, getting a computer player out, or retiring the computer's side to end an inning.

Before play begins, the player can choose which city/state to represent from a list containing [[Los Angeles]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Atlanta]], Pittsburg (probably a typo for [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]), [[Chicago]], [[Montreal]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Boston]], [[Milwaukee]], [[New York City]], [[California]] and [[Texas]] (all of whom had major-league baseball franchises in 1983). The computer then randomly selects from among the remaining cities.

If at any time the computer team has scored more runs than the player, the game immediately ends. The high-scores list ("FAR OUT PLAYERS") can hold the initials of up to six players.

== Reception ==

Sega had sold over 15,000 arcade units in Japan by early June 1983, and were expecting to ship a further 10,000 arcade units within the country by the end of June. It was Japan's highest-grossing arcade game around mid-1983.<ref name="CB">{{cite magazine |title=#1 Game In Japan: Sega Electronics To Bring 'Champion Baseball' Vid to U.S. |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=June 16, 1983 |pages=33–4 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/80s/1983/CB-1983-06-18.pdf#page=33}}</ref>

When Japanese magazine ''[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]'' published their first bi-weekly arcade charts in their June 1, 1983 issue, ''Champion Baseball'' was listed as the most successful [[table arcade cabinet]] of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=213|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 June 1983|page=29|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830601p.pdf#page=15}}</ref> It remained at the top of the ''Game Machine'' table arcade game charts for three months through June<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=214|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 June 1983|page=27|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830615p.pdf#page=14}}</ref> and July<ref name="GM215">{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=215|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 July 1983|pages=29–30|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830701p.pdf#page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=216|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 July 1983|page=37|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830715p.pdf#page=19}}</ref> to August 1983,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=217|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 August 1983|page=29|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830801p.pdf#page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=218|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 August 1983|page=27|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830815p.pdf#page=14}}</ref> before eventually being dethroned by ''[[Elevator Action]]'' in September.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=219|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 September 1983|page=29|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830901p.pdf#page=15}}</ref> ''Champion Baseball'' remained in the top ten for the rest of the year, through December 1983.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=225|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 December 1983|page=33|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19831201p.pdf#page=17}}</ref>

In North America, the game was successful in test locations around mid-1983. Sega were expecting to repeat some of the game's Japanese success in North America, due to baseball being a popular sport in the region.<ref name="CB"/> Upon release in North America, it became one of the best-performing arcade video games distributed by Sega Electronics (formerly [[Gremlin Industries|Sega/Gremlin]]) in 1983. However, the [[golden age of arcade video games]] was coming to an end in North America, with Sega closing down its Sega Electronics division and selling it to [[Bally Manufacturing]] later that year.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Adlum |first=Eddie |title=The Replay Years: Reflections from Eddie Adlum |magazine=RePlay |date=November 1985 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=134-175 (168-70) |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-11-issue-no.-2-november-1985-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2011%2C%20Issue%20No.%202%20-%20November%201985/page/168}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Champion Baseball II'' was released the same year, with identical graphics but allowing two players to compete with each other. ''Game Machine'' listed the sequel on their October 1, 1983 issue as being the top-grossing new table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型新製品 (New Videos-Table Type)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=221|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 October 1983|page=29|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19831001p.pdf#page=15}}</ref> Another sequel, titled ''Super Champion Baseball'', was released in 1989.

===Impact===
Upon release, the sports gameplay of ''Champion Baseball'' was a departure from the "[[Shoot 'em up|space games]]" and "cartoon" [[action games]] that had previously dominated the arcades.<ref name="CB"/> ''Champion Baseball'' went on to serve as the prototype for later [[List of baseball video games|baseball video games]].<ref name="Famitsu"/><ref name="Champion"/> [[Nintendo]], for example, later released their own competing sports game, ''[[Baseball (1983 video game)|Baseball]]'', initially for the [[Famicom]] console in late 1983 and then ported to the arcade [[Nintendo VS. System]] as ''VS. Baseball'' in 1984. While ''VS. Baseball'' lacked certain features of ''Champion Baseball'', it had improved [[multiplayer]] capabilities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=Beyond Donkey Kong: A History of Nintendo Arcade Games |date=6 August 2020 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-1-4766-8420-8 |pages=132–5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3D0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA135}}</ref>
