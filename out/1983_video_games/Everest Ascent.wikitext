'''''Everest Ascent''''' is a text and graphics [[adventure game]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]] computers. It was published by [[Richard Shepherd Software]] in 1983. The goal is to reach the top of [[Mount Everest]] in 20 days. Players must allocate their limited funds to keep their [[Sherpa people|sherpas]] well fed and supplied in order to reach the summit.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |date=May 1984 |title=Spectrum Software Guide |url=https://archive.org/details/crash-magazine-04/page/n67/mode/1up?view=theater |journal=Crash |publisher=Newsfield Limited |issue=4 |pages=68 |quote=You have 20 days to reach the summit of Everest, starting off from limited funds (money comes in from sponsors if you seem to be doing well, but it isn't credited to you if you've forgotten to buy a radio). You must hire Sherpas with homely names and varying strengths and the habit of deserting you if you're not fed properly. Their equipment and supplies are expensive and they eat like horses. Neat graphics and the familiar prompt menu for buying and moving about. It takes some getting into and early expeditions usually last a short time until you realise what's needed most. A good average. |via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Contemporary reviews of ''Everest Ascent'' in computer hobbyist magazines were frequently concerned with the game's difficulty, but considered the game positively overall. [[Your Computer (British magazine)|''Your Computer'']] magazine wrote of the game that it is "more of a strategy game than a straight Adventure [sic]", and joked that the significant difficulty may be due to the sherpas you hire in-game having English names, rather than Nepalese names, and thus, "not what they used to be".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jones |first=Meirion |date=July 1983 |title=ZX SPECTRUM SOFTWARE |url=https://archive.org/details/your-computer-magazine-july-1983/mode/1up?view=theater |journal=Your Computer |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=63 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' called the game "a good average."<ref name=":0" /> ''Home Computing Weekly'' complained that the player's interface offered insufficient information, but still found the game interesting.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=D.T. |date=5 April 1983 |editor-last=Harris |editor-first=Ron |title=To boldly go . . . into the unknown with your micro |url=https://archive.org/details/home-computing-weekly-005/page/n20/mode/1up?view=theater |journal=Home Computing Weekly |publisher=Argus Specialist Publications |publication-place=London, UK |issue=5 |pages=21 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
