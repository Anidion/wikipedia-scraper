[[CRASH (magazine)|''CRASH'']] magazine: "Softekâ€™s version of the noble creepy-crawlie game is just about as good as any. Here the scorpion lends to drop fleas rather as though they were bombs, which makes an interesting variation. Machine Code, nice graphics, nine skill levels. Good".<ref>{{cite magazine |date=February 1984 |title=Living Guide... |magazine=Crash] |issue=1 |pages=53}}</ref>
