The game takes place in Tibet. The player named ''Mac Steele'' is an archaeologist, who tries to find a valuable diamond called "The Serpent's Star". He needs 13 scrolls, which provide advice to the diamond's hideout in the town of ''Kara-Koram''. Therefore, Mac Steele has to travel through Tibet, to solve a lot of puzzles and to meet other [[non-player character]]s, e.g. Buddhist monks.<ref>Michael Ciraclo: ''Serpent's Star'', ''Antic Amiga Magazine'', Vol. 3 Nr.12, 4/1985, p.80; Heinrich Lenhardt: ''Der Drachenstern'', ''Happy Computer'' 4/1985, p.142f.
