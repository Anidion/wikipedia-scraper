'''''Robot Tank''''' is a first-person [[shoot 'em up]] written by [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] for the [[Atari 2600]] and published by [[Activision]] in 1983. It is similar in design to [[Atari, Inc.]]'s ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' tank combat arcade video game and more so to its 2600 port. ''Robot Tank'' adds different systems which can individually be damaged—instead of the vehicle always exploding upon being shot—and weather effects.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Robot Tank Atari 2600.jpg|thumb|left|The first person view from the tank]]
The player remotely controls a robot tank in 2019,<ref name=atarimania>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-2600-vcs-robot-tank_s6928.html|title=Atari 2600 VCS Robot Tank |website=Atarimania.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> using [[radar]] to find and destroy enemy robot tanks intent on reaching downtown [[Santa Clara, California]], United States. The enemy is organized into [[Squadron (army)|squadrons]] of 12 tanks each.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataritimes.com/index.php?ArticleIDX=247|title=Robot Tank - The Atari Times|website=Ataritimes.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>  Defeating an enemy squadron adds a reserve tank to the initial three, to a maximum of 12.<ref name=atarimania/> The game ends when all of a player's tanks are destroyed.

As the player's tank is damaged, firepower and/or visual display capabilities are irreparably worsened.<ref name=atarimania/> Enough damage eventually destroys a tank. Combat can take place at any time of day or night (displayed on-screen), which adds challenge in tracking enemy combatants by radar alone. Weather conditions, announced at the start of each level, can be clear, [[rain]], [[snow]], or [[fog]]. Rain slows the tank's movements. Snow causes the tank to lose traction. Fog impairs the tank's vision.

==Development==
''Robot Tank'' was designed by [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] for [[Activision]].{{sfn|The Video Game Update includes Computer Entertainer|1983|p=34|ref=VGU-Rev}} Miller had previously developed games at [[Atari, Inc.]] such as ''[[Surround (video game)|Surround]]'' (1977), ''[[Hangman (video game)|Hangman]]'' (1978) and ''[[Basketball (1978 video game)|Basketball]]'' (1978).{{sfn|Kunkel|1982|p=13}}{{sfn|Sansweet|1983}}{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=140}}{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=236}} After leaving Atari, Inc. to form Activision with [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]], Miller made the games ''Checkers'' (1980), ''[[Tennis (1981 video game)|Tennis]]'' (1981) and ''[[Ice Hockey (1981 video game)|Ice Hockey]]'' (1981), and his most financially successful game by 1983:''[[Starmaster]]'' (1982).{{sfn|Sansweet|1983}}{{sfn|Donovan|2011}}{{sfn|Fleming|2007}} Prior to developing ''Robot Tank'', Miller began developing a racing game which he halted as he described it as "unworkable".{{sfn|Sansweet|1983}}

''Robot Tank'' started out as a game about a remote-controlled tank battle which would had the development title of ''Robotank''.{{sfn|Sansweet|1983}} Miller spent about two months writing and editing code and producing about 200 pages of hand-written notes of computer print outs. Miller consulted with his fellow designers at Activision and began programming in the games graphics that included mountains, tanks and other visual features and colors. The next two months of development were spent on gameplay making video and audio and gameplay have the appropriate level of challenge. The final two months involved his colleagues playing the game and hundreds of hours debugging the game. Miller recalled that "After I finish a game, I really hate it and I don't want to see it again for months."{{sfn|Sansweet|1983}}

==Release==
The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in January 1983 that ''Robot Tank'' was scheduled for release in mid-1983.{{sfn|Sansweet|1983}} The game was released for the Atari 2600 in June 1983.{{sfn|The Video Game Update includes Computer Entertainer|1983|p=64|ref=VGU-Rel}} ''[[Electronic Games]]'' listed ''Robot Tank'' along with ''[[Megamania]]'' (1982), ''[[Enduro (video game)|Enduro]]'' (1983), ''[[River Raid]]'' (1982) and ''[[Pitfall!]]'' (1982) as among the biggest hits for Activision in 1983.{{sfn|Katz|1983|p=69}} 

''Robot Tank'' was included in the compilation titles ''[[Activision Anthology]]'' (2002) for PC, [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Game Boy Advance]] and in ''Activision Hits Remixed'' (2006) for the [[PlayStation Portable]].{{sfn|Dunham|2002}}{{sfn|Harris|2006|ref=ActAnth}}{{sfn|Harris|2006a|ref=ActRemix}}

From contemporary reviews, critics such as [[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]], juvenile journalist [[Rawson Stovall]] and publication ''[[Computer Entertainer]]'' all praised the game for its visuals. Kunkel said the game's graphics was "non-parallel in the 2600 universe" noting the visual depth.{{sfn|Kunkel|1983|p=88}} Stovall praised small touches to the graphics, such as the visuals becoming screen static when a player's tank is destroyed.{{sfn|Stovall|1984|pp=22-23}} The ''Computer Entertainer'' review specifically praised its unique first-person point of view in its gameplay.{{sfn|The Video Game Update includes Computer Entertainer|1983|p=34|ref=VGU-Rev}}

Critics also complimented the gameplay, Kunkel and Robert J. Sodaro of ''[[Videogaming Illustrated|Videogaming & Computergaming Illustrated]]'' specifically noting how the weather effected the gameplay.{{sfn|Kunkel|1983|p=88}}{{sfn|Sodaro|1983|p=75}} Michael Blanchet of ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' stated that "for every obvious strategy there is another subtle, almost hidden one that must be discovered and implemented. This is a good solid challenge for anyone looking for a different breed of shoot-em-up."{{sfn|Blanchet|1983|p=49}} Sodaro and Blanchet both critiqued the lack of any way to repair the players damaged tanks.{{sfn|Sodaro|1983|p=75}}{{sfn|Blanchet|1983|p=49}} Kunkel went as far to declare the game Miller's "masterpiece" and "perhaps the finest target-arcade program ever developed for the 2600." while ''Computer Entertainer'' stated it was "the best combat game yet for the Atari 2600 system."{{sfn|Kunkel|1983|p=88}}{{sfn|The Video Game Update includes Computer Entertainer|1983|p=34|ref=VGU-Rev}}

Some critics felt the game was unoriginal. Dan persons of ''Video Games'' suggested that developers "should be moving on from this simple sort of shoot 'em-up, but ''Robot Tank'' has been done with such obvious care and so much style that I can't help but love it."{{sfn|Persons|1984|p=65}} Stovall found that it was a hybrid of [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]]'s ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' (1980) and having the gameplay of ''Starmaster'', while Sodaro found that the game was not a knock-off of ''BattleZone'', and only borrowed elements such as being set in a first-person view of a tank.{{sfn|Sodaro|1983|p=75}}{{sfn|Blanchet|1983|pp=48-49}} A representative from Activision responded to the game being derivative of ''Battlezone'', saying "We don't steal any of our ideas. The game idea (''Robot Tank'') is a generic one in the industry."{{sfn|Videogaming & Computergaming Illustrated|1983|p=5|ref=Nybbles}}

''Electronic Fun with Computer & Games'' included ''Robot Tank'' as among the best video games ever in 1984.
{{sfn|Electronic Fun with Computer & Games|1984|p=26|ref=EFCG}}

From retrospective reviews, Brett Alan Weiss of [[AllGame]] referred to ''Robot Tank'' was both "far ahead of its time" and "one of the most sophisticated Atari 2600 games." while stating that most of the weather and time change in the game still game the game a false sense of versatility, as the game will still just about dodging and attacking other tanks which grew repetitive.{{sfn|Weiss}} Jeremy Dunham commented on the game in his review of ''Activision Anthology'' (2002). Dunham stated that along with ''[[Pitfall II: Lost Caverns]]'' (1984) ''Robot Tank'' really stood out for its graphics with its 3D-aesthetic and the formentioned weather and short-circuit effects.{{sfn|Dunham|2002}}
