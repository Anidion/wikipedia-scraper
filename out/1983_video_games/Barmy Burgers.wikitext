==Gameplay==
[[Image:BarmyBurgersScr1.gif|thumb|left|All burgers have been assembled, completing the level]]

The player is a chef attempting to create three larger-than-life-sized [[hamburger]]s on a level made of horizontal platforms and connecting ladders. Walking over an ingredient causes it to drop onto lower platforms until complete sandwiches are formed at the bottom of the screen. Sausages and fried eggs chase the player; if they touch the chef, a life is lost.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Throwing [[black pepper|pepper]] on a pursuer briefly stuns it.

==Reception==
''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' praised the game for its sound and graphics,<ref>{{citation |title=CRASH 3 - Platform Games |magazine=Crash |publication-date=April 1984 |issue=3 |url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/03/lguide07.htm}}</ref> while ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said that "''Barmy Burgers'' is a good game for any Spectrum-owning ''Burgertime'' fan."<ref>{{citation |title=Burger Time for Fast Food Addicts! |magazine=[[World of Spectrum]] |issue=26 |pages=33 |publication-date=December 1983 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue026/Pages/CVG02600033.jpg}}</ref>
