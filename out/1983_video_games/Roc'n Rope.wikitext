{{nihongo foot|'''''Roc'n Rope'''''|ロックンロープ|Rokkun Rōpu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (written as '''''Roc 'N Rope''''' on the American flyer and in ''Konami Arcade Classics'') is a [[platform game]] released in arcades in 1983 by [[Konami]], Kosuka, and Interlogic. It was designed by [[Tokuro Fujiwara]].<ref name="Fujiwara"/> The player controls a flashlight and harpoon-gun equipped archaeologist who must ascend a series of rocky platforms to reach a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] bird.

Coleco released versions of ''Roc'n Rope'' for the [[Atari 2600]]<ref name=mania/> and [[ColecoVision]] in 1984.

==Gameplay==
The player has to avoid ferocious man-sized dinosaurs and red-haired cavemen against which there are no direct means of offense. The only ways to defeat the opponents are to either daze them with the flashlight, or wait for them to be suspended on a harpoon rope and cause them fall down, an element which adds a certain complexity to the game. Bonus items to collect include fallen phoenix feathers and phoenix eggs, which grant the player invulnerability from the prehistoric denizens for a short period of time.

==Reception==
''Roc'n Rope'' was among Konami's early arcade hits,  including ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' (1981), ''[[Frogger]]'' (1981), and ''[[Yie Ar Kung-Fu]]'' (1984).<ref>{{cite magazine |title=A Conversation With...

==Legacy==
''Roc'n Rope'' was the first "wire action" game. It became the basis for [[Capcom]]'s 1987 game ''[[Bionic Commando]]'', which [[Tokuro Fujiwara]] intended to be an expanded version of ''Roc'n Rope''.<ref name="Fujiwara">[http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/tokuro-fujiwara/ The Man Who Made Ghosts’n Goblins: Tokuro Fujiwara Interview], ''Continue'', Vol. 12, 2003</ref>
