''Assault'' was produced by Bomb, a video game developer based out of Asia.<ref>{{cite journal |title=It's Bomb! |journal=Videogaming Illustrated |date=September 1983 |page=38 |url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_and_Computer_Gaming_Illustrated_1983-09_Ion_International_US/page/n37 |accessdate=10 August 2019}}</ref> It received lukewarm reviews from critics upon release, many referring to it as a rip-off of games such as ''[[Galaxian]]'' and ''[[Demon Attack]]'' and criticizing its graphics. Some reviewers did state that despite being unoriginal, was still fun to play, labeling it one of Bomb's better releases for the 2600.
