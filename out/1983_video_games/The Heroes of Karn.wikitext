Music was written by Chris Cox.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1191|title=Lemon64 - Heroes of Karn, the}}</ref> The Spectrum and Amstrad versions were adapted by David M.

==Gameplay==
The player must rescue four heroes who have been magically imprisoned, and thus save the land of Karn from dominion by evil creatures. The heroes are Beren the swordsman, Istar the wizard, Haldir the Elf-lord,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Haldir the Elf-lord |url=https://thetolkien.forum/wiki/Haldir-of-Lothl%C3%B3rien |access-date=20 March 2024 |website=TheTolkien Forum}}</ref> and Khadim the dwarf.

The game's [[parser]] accepts relatively complex sentences for the time (e.g. "attack giant clam with shovel").<ref name=pcg04>{{ citation | url=https://archive.org/stream/personalcomputergames-magazine-04/PersonalComputerGames_04#page/n77/mode/2up | journal=[[Personal Computer Games]] | title = Personal Computer Games Commodore 64 Review | date=March 1984 | issue=4 | pages=74–75 }}</ref> The puzzles are mostly straightforward, involving the use of an object found elsewhere to defeat the creature that is impeding progress.  The creatures and [[NPCs]] in the game, including the heroes themselves, are rather inert and are very limited in their interactions. The game has 65 locations.<ref name=pcg07>{{ citation | url=https://archive.org/stream/personalcomputergames-magazine-07/PersonalComputerGames_07#page/n99/mode/2up | journal=[[Personal Computer Games]] | title = Adventures in Colour | date=June 1984 | issue=7 | pages=107 }}</ref> The game is mostly text, with illustrations for some of the locations.

==Reception==
The Commodore 64 version of the game received criticism for slow loading of graphical scenes,<ref name="zzap64">{{ citation | url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-002/ZZap_64_Issue_002_1985_Jun#page/n59/mode/2up | journal=[[Zzap!64]] | publisher=[[Newsfield Publications Ltd]] | title = My Ten All-time Favorites | date=June 1985 | issue=1 | pages=67–68 }}</ref> which could take as long as several minutes to display completely.  The Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were by a different artist (Terry Greer) and quicker to draw.
