'''''Cube Quest''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade video game|arcade]] [[laserdisc game]] by American company Simutrek released in 1983. It was primarily designed and programmed by Paul Allen Newell, who previously wrote some [[Atari 2600]] games.<ref name=digitpress/> It was introduced at Tokyo's [[Amusement Machine Show]] (AM Show) in September 1983<ref name="JAMMA"/> and then the AMOA show the following month,<ref name="CashMachine"/> before releasing in North America in December 1983.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Akagi |first1=Masumi |title=アーケードTVゲームリスト国内•海外編(1971-2005) |trans-title=Arcade TV Game List: Domestic • Overseas Edition (1971-2005) |date=13 October 2006 |publisher=Amusement News Agency |language=ja |location=Japan |isbn=978-4990251215 |page=133 |url=https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005/page/n134}}</ref>

It combines [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] [[3D computer graphics|3D polygon]] graphics with [[laserdisc]]-streamed, animated backgrounds, making it the first [[arcade video game]] to use real-time [[3D computer graphics]].<ref name=ah/><ref>{{cite web |title=Video Game Flyers: Cube Quest, Simutrek |url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=260 |website=The Arcade Flyer Archive |access-date=22 May 2021}}</ref> At around the same time, [[pre-rendered]] 3D computer graphics were used in [[Funai]]'s arcade laserdisc game ''Interstellar'',<ref name="GM226">{{cite magazine|title=立体CGを駆使したVDゲーム 〜 未来の宇宙戦争 〜 フナイから 『インターステラー』|trans-title=VD Game That Makes Full Use of 3D CG – Future Space War: "Interstellar" from Funai|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|issue=226|date=15 December 1983|page=24|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19831215p.pdf#page=13}}</ref> introduced at the same AM Show in September 1983.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Overseas Readers Column: 21st AM Show Of Tokyo Held Heralding The Age Of The Video Disk|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=223|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 November 1983|page=34|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19831101p.pdf#page=18}}</ref> ''Cube Quest'' was nevertheless the first game to use real-time 3D computer graphics, predating [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]]'s ''[[I, Robot (video game)|I, Robot]]'' (1984).

==Gameplay==
[[file:Cubequest1.png|thumb|left|A game in progress]]

The objective of the game is to guide a spaceship through the Cubic World to reach the Treasure of Mytha located at the opposite extreme of the player's origin. Each cube edge leads to one of 54 uniquely themed corridors where a wave of enemies must be dispatched in a [[shoot 'em up#Tube and rail shooters|tube shooter]] style gameplay sequence. Destroy the Dewellers of the Dark, up to 1000 points, maneuver the spaceship to avoid the obstacle and destroy the Guardian Cubes, up to 5000 points. Finally, after reaching the Treasure of Mytha, receive a reward befitting the Master of the Cube Quest. After that, the game starts over again.

==Development==
The game's developer Simutrek was founded by former [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] and [[Exidy]] executive Noah Anglin.<ref name="JAMMA"/> Paul Allen Newell was responsible for the design and programming.<ref name="digitpress">{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_paul_allen_newell.html|title = DP Interviews}}</ref> The laserdisc backgrounds were produced by [[Robert Abel and Associates]]. [[Ken Nordine]] (uncredited) voiced the introductory narration. The game was planned to be released for the [[Vectrex]], but was cancelled when the console went off the market.<ref>[http://www.the-nextlevel.com/tnl/threads/44412-Cancelled-Games Cancelled Game]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://vectrexmuseum.com/vectrexgamemodules.php |title=Vectrex Games |access-date=2015-10-31 |archive-date=2021-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210706220910/http://vectrexmuseum.com/vectrexgamemodules.php |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Paul Allen Newell was influenced by the [[computer animation]]s of [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]] and [[Jim Blinn]], and [[Golden age of arcade video games|early 1980s arcade game]]s such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]'', ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'' and ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stilphen |first1=Scott |title=Paul Allen Newell (interview) |url=http://www.2600connection.com/interviews/paul_allen_newell/interview_paul_allen_newell.html |access-date=24 May 2021 |work=2600 Connection |date=2008}}</ref> The game's CGI backgrounds were later used in ''[[Beyond the Mind's Eye]]''.

==Reception and legacy==
The game received mixed reviews upon release, with praise for its graphics but criticism over its gameplay. Upon its AM Show debut, the game "was deemed highly complicated for a mainstream electronic diversion" according to ''[[Cash Box]]'' magazine.<ref name="JAMMA">{{cite magazine |title="Somber" JAMMA Show Hosts Five Laser Disc Games |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=October 15, 1983 |pages=32, 34 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/80s/1983/CB-1983-10-15.PDF#page=45}}</ref> Upon its AMOA debut, the game was called "visually stunning" but "hallucinogenic" and "[[neo-psychedelic]]" by ''Cash Box''.<ref name="CashMachine">{{cite magazine |title=Cash Machine |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=November 12, 1983 |pages=30–4 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/80s/1983/CB-1983-11-12.PDF#page=32}}</ref> In ''Computer Games'' magazine, Ben Gold and [[Eugene Jarvis]] praised the graphics, but Jarvis criticized the gameplay, calling it "a poor version of ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]''."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Bloom |first1=Steve |title=The Lasers Have Landed!

=== Possible connection to ''Polybius'' urban legend ===
Various researchers, such as Patrick Kellogg, believe that ''Cube Quest'' may have been an inspiration for the [[Polybius (urban legend)|''Polybius'']] urban legend,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patrickkellogg.com/hobbies/polybius.htm|title=Polybius by Patrick Kellogg|last=Kellogg|first=Patrick|access-date=November 28, 2022}}</ref> due to many similarities between the game and the legend. 

''Polybius'' is frequently described as a [[Tempest (video game)|''Tempest'']]-like shoot-em-up with surreal, often harmful visuals that was frequently visited by "[[men in black]]" before suddenly disappearing forever. ''Cube Quest'', meanwhile, is a ''Tempest''-like game with then-advanced visuals that, due to the unreliable nature of [[interactive movie|LaserDisc-based video games]], was frequently visited for maintenance and often vanished from arcades after a short period of time. 

The name of ''Polybius''{{'}} supposed creator, "Sinneslöchen", even bears a passing resemblance to ''Cube Quest'''s developer Simutrek.
