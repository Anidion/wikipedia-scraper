'''''Pigs in Space''''' is a three-in-one 1983 video game developed and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] for the [[Atari 2600]].

==Gameplay==
The game consists of three different ''[[The Muppets (franchise)|Muppets]]''-themed games accessible from a common menu.

The first game is a ''[[Space Invaders]]'' clone called ''Chickenvaders'' in which Captain Link Hogthrob runs along the bottom of the screen firing sausages at egg-dropping chickens, and at [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] who occasional flies across the top of the screen in a [[flying saucer]]. 

The second is ''Pastaroids'', a ''[[Frogger]]'' clone in which [[Miss Piggy]] must dodge flying pasta and meatballs to cross the screen from bottom to top to reach the ship ''USS Swinetrek''.

The third is ''Escape from the Planet of the Gonzoids'', in which the player is Doctor Strangepork controlling the ''Swinetrek'' as it flies through tunnels shooting robots (called Gonzoids) that throw pizzas.<ref name="Weiss" /><ref name="VGI Oct 83">{{cite news |title=Kidding Around |url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_and_Computer_Gaming_Illustrated_1983-10_Ion_International_US/page/n7/mode/2up?q=pigs |access-date=February 23, 2021 |work=Videogaming and Computer Gaming Illustrated |date=October 1983 |pages=7â€“8}}</ref>

==Reception==
A review in the November 1983 issue of ''Videogaming and Computer Gaming Illustrated'' was broadly positive, especially about the gameplay and graphics, and describing the game as "a very satisfying release" having "something for everyone". The only point of criticism was the simplistic graphics used to depict Gonzo.<ref name="VGI Nov 83">{{cite news |title=Pigs in Space |url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_and_Computer_Gaming_Illustrated_1983-11_Ion_International_US/page/n13/mode/2up?q=pigs |access-date=February 23, 2021 |work=Videogaming and Computer Gaming Illustrated |date=November 1983 |page=15}}</ref> The 1984 Software Encyclopedia published by ''[[Electronic Games magazine|Electronic Games]]'' magazine was broadly positive about the game, giving it an overall rating of 7/10.<ref name="1984 Software Encyclopedia">{{cite news |title=Pigs in Space |url=https://archive.org/details/1984_Software_Encyclopedia_Number_2_1983_Reese_Communications_US/page/n95/mode/2up?q=pigs |access-date=February 23, 2021 |work=1984 Software Encyclopedia |date=1984 |page=97}}</ref>

In a 2009 review written for ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', Michal Mozejko gave a mixed review, criticizing especially the slowness of ''Escape from the Planet of the Gonzoids'' but appreciating the nostalgia value of the game.<ref name="Mozejko">{{cite news |last1=Mozejko |first1=Michal |title=PIGS IN SPACE |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/pigs-in-space/ |access-date=February 23, 2021 |work=Retro Gamer |date=June 10, 2009}}</ref> In the 2011 book ''Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984 A Complete Reference Guide'', Brett Weiss gave a mixed review as "derivative (if nice looking) games" and criticized especially ''Escape from the Planet of the Gonzoids'', which he described as a "dull, repetitious shooter".<ref name="Weiss" />
