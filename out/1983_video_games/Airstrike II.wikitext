'''''Airstrike II''''' (shown on the box cover, but not the title screen, as '''''Airstrike 2''''') is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] written by Steven A. Riding and published by [[English Software]] for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] in 1983.<ref name="atarimania"/> ''Airstrike II'' is a successor to the 1982 ''[[Airstrike_(video_game)|Airstrike]]'' which was also programmed by Riding. Both games have gameplay similar to the ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' arcade game.

The goal of ''Airstrike II'' is to clear all five zones using a fighter ship armed with a laser gun and bombs. The ship's ammo and fuel are limited, but can be replenished by shooting a respective dump (F for fuel and A for ammo). The player's ship must navigate tight caverns and watch for enemy fighters and heat-sensitive missiles. The game is split in five zones, which have identical layout but increasing level of difficulty. Some improvements over the predecessor include addition of a scrolling map and a title screen music.

==Reception==
''Airstrike II'' was met with a mixed response. ''[[Big K (magazine)|Big K]]'' magazine reviewed it twice, with the first reviewer concluding: "It may be very clever, but it's a terrible looking game, and I, for one, spend too much time in front of a VDU to want to have to look at something this ugly."<ref name="bigk1"/> while a second reviewer was more forgiving: "Excellent use has been made of the Atari 800's considerable graphics [...] As it stands, probably English Software's best title".<ref name="bigk2"/>

Bob Chappell writing for ''[[Personal Computer News]]'' also liked it: "The caverns are filled with defence systems, making the game possibly the toughest and most varied version of this classic to date."<ref name="pcn"/> ''Home Computing Weekly'' covered ''Airstrike II'' in issue #054, concluding: "The graphics are nicely detailed and well complemented by colour. If you haven't tired of the idea, Airstrike 2 should satisfy your appetite for quite a while."<ref name="hcw"/>
