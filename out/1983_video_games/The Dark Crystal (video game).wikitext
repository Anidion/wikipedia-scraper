'''''Hi-Res Adventure #6: The Dark Crystal''''' is a [[graphic adventure game]] based on [[Jim Henson]]'s 1982 fantasy film, ''[[The Dark Crystal]]''. The game was designed by [[Roberta Williams]] and was the first ''Hi-Res Adventure'' directly released under the SierraVenture label in 1983.<ref name=gamecoverback/> Versions were published for the [[Apple II]] and [[Atari 8-bit computers]]. An alternate version of the game intended for younger players called '''''Gelfling Adventure''''' was released in 1984.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gelfling Adventure |url=https://www.mocagh.org/loadpage.php?getgame=gelfling |website=Museum of Computer Adventure Game History |access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gelfling Adventure |url=http://www.vintage-sierra.net/childrens/gelflingadv.php |website=Vintage-Sierra.net |access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref>

It took Roberta Williams a little over a month to develop the design for the game, which was then turned over to programmers and artists.<ref name=creativecomputing>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n3/168_The_dark_crystal.php | title=The Dark Crystal | magazine=Creative Computing | date=March 1983 | access-date=September 13, 2008 | author=Anderson, John | pages=168}}</ref>

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' considered the game to be better than the film, stating ''The Dark Crystal''{{'s}} "thin story that failed to serve the movie well is comparatively top-drawer material in the game" and called the graphics "delightful".<ref name="tommervik19830506">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=6&id=11 | title=The Dark Crystal | work=Softline | date=May–Jun 1983 | access-date=July 28, 2014 | author=Tommervik, Margot Comstock | pages=45}}</ref> The game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of "1984 Best Computer Adventure" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |date= February 1984 |title= Arcade Alley: The 1984 Arcade Awards, Part II |journal= Video|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 11|pages= 28–29|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>

In a 1983 review of the Atari 8-bit version for ''Hi-Res'' magazine, Mark S. Murley found the game too clearly linear and disliked having to swap between three disks. He wrote:

{{blockquote|text=If the narrowness of the game and the disk-swapping problem were the only negative aspects of ''The Dark Crystal'', then I might be tempted to at least recommend it, however, to novice Adventurers. The graphics themselves are a little lackluster, and the color is not the best. This is distracting in an Adventure of this scope wherein so much of the player's time is spent looking at dozens of screens.<ref name=hires/>}}
