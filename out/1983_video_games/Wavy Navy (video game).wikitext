'''''Wavy Navy''''' is a video game designed by Rodney McAuley for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Sirius Software]] in 1983.<ref name="giantlist"/> Versions for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and [[Commodore 64]] were released the same year. ''Wavy Navy'' is a nautically themed [[fixed shooter]] with left and right controls to move the player's [[PT boat]], but there is an additional vertical element as the boat moves up and down with the large ocean waves that scroll beneath it.<ref name="faughn"/> The direction and speed of the waves vary per level.<ref name="linzmayer"/> Some reviewers found that the movement of the waves added an interesting twist, while others called it too similar to other fixed shooters like ''[[Galaxian]]''.

Prior to ''Wavy Navy'', McAuley wrote several Apple II games for ''[[Creative Computing]]'' magazine.<ref name="giantlist"/>

==Gameplay==

The core enemies are planes grouped in a formation, similar to ''[[Galaxian]]'', that break off and dive at the player's boat.<ref name="linzmayer"/> Other flying enemies are machine gun-equipped helicopters, [[Exocet]] missiles, and bomb-dropping jets. The helicopters take the place of the flagships in ''Galaxian'', sitting atop the rows of planes. Mines also appear in the water.

Completing a round by destroying all attackers awards 50 points for each PT boat remaining.<ref name=manual/>

==Reception==
Owen Linzmayer, writing for ''Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games'', rated the game "Excellent" and called the graphics "superbly done."<ref name="linzmayer"/> A review of the Atari 8-bit version in ''Videogaming and Computergaming Illustrated'' began, "This one might well be called ''[[Galaga]]'' meets ''[[Moon Patrol]]'' on the high seas."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Papa |first1=Vincent J. |title=Wavy Navy |journal=Videogaming and Computergaming Illustrated |date=November 1983 |page=58 |url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_and_Computer_Gaming_Illustrated_1983-11_Ion_International_US/page/n55}}</ref> Reviewing the Commodore 64 version, ''[[Ahoy!]]'' magazine wrote: "Sirius has succeeded where others have failed in working new wrinkles into the slide-and-shoot format."<ref name="ahoy"/> The ''1984 Software Encyclopedia'', published by ''[[Electronic Games]]'', gave the game a 9 out of 10: "By adding a few novel details to the basic invasion game genre, designer Rodney McAuley has produced something rather special".<ref name=se1984/>

In an ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' review, David Faughn noted the similarities to ''[[Galaxian]]'' and cautioned not buying ''Wavy Navy'' if you already own that game.<ref name="faughn"/> Michael Blanchet, for ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'', asked "How long does Sirius, or any software company for that matter, think the gaming public wants to play silly rehashes of ''[[Space Invaders]]''?" and "are video game designers devoid of imagination?"<ref name="efun"/>
