==Reception==
''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' magazine wrote:
{{quote|This game has wandered off the "Panic" theme to some degree. You play the part of a small, jerk-moving man who is equipped with a pick for digging holes. Six platforms give the game quite a height and these are connected by various lengths of thin ladders. Monsters (vampire types) are tiny, but they do home in on you very quickly — good job you’ve got nine lives! There is no monster bashing in this game (boring) the monsters being killed merely by their falling through a hole (or holes) in the platform — although this doesn’t always kill them....<ref name="Living Guide">{{cite journal |date=February 1984 |title=Living Guide... |journal=[[CRASH (magazine)|Crash]] |issue=1 |pages=52}}</ref>}}

The magazine did not recommend the game, stating it "gives the impression of being out of date" with its "small, jerky character graphics" and  "lack of sound and not much use of colour".<ref name="Living Guide"/>
