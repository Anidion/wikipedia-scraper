'''''Pssst''''' is an [[action game|action]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Ultimate Play the Game]] that was released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in June 1983. In the game, Robbie the Robot has to protect his plant (a ''Thyrgodian Megga Chrisanthodil'') as it is attacked by various insects, each of which needs a different repellent to neutralise it. ''Pssst'' was the second game to be released by Ultimate, after ''[[Jetpac]]''.

The game was written by Chris Stamper and graphics were designed by his brother, Tim Stamper. ''Pssst'' was one of the very few Spectrum games also available in [[read-only memory|ROM]] format for use with the [[ZX Interface 2|Interface 2]], allowing "instantaneous" loading of the game (the normal method of cassette loading could take several minutes).<ref name=interface>{{citation | last=Gilbert |first=John |title=Interface Games are Fast but not Furious |journal=[[Sinclair User]] |issue=24 |pages=54–55 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |date=March 1984 |url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-024/SinclairUser_024_Mar_1984#page/n53/mode/2up }}</ref> The game received positive reviews from two publications upon release, with critics mainly praising its presentation and gameplay. 

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Pssst_gameplay.png|thumb|left|The player has protected the plant from parasites, causing it to flower and end the level.]]

The game is presented from a single, 2D perspective, and revolves around Robbie the Robot's objective to defend his plant from interstellar space [[slug]]s, [[leech]]es and [[midge]]s.<ref name=play>{{citation | title=PSST is this the Ultimate? | journal=[[Personal Computer Games]] | date=June 1983 | issue=1 | page=5 | url=https://archive.org/stream/personalcomputergames-magazine-01/PersonalComputerGames_01#page/n6/mode/1up }}</ref> The plant grows from the bottom centre of the screen, and spray cans containing three different [[pesticide]]s are located on ledges on each side of the screen. Bonus items such as fertiliser and fly swatters appear on unoccupied ledges which will increase both the players score and the plant's growth rate.<ref name="HC" />

There are three types of coloured parasite, and three types of pesticide, which will either kill, stun, or have no effect on the parasites. The player can only carry one type of pesticide at a time; during the early stages of the game the lethal pesticide can be carried at all times, but later stages have more than one type of parasite on screen at once, making the choice of pesticide more tactical.<ref name="play" />

As the plant grows it may sprout leaves; these increase the growth rate but also vulnerability to the parasites. Once the plant reaches a predetermined height it flowers and the player advances to the next level. A life will be deducted whenever the plant dies or the player makes contact with a parasite.

''Pssst'' reached number 10 in the [[Media Research Information Bureau|MRIB]] Top 30 software charts in July 1983 while ''Jetpac'' was still at number 1.<ref name='pcncharts11aug'>{{cite magazine |title=Top Thirty|magazine=Personal Computer News|issue=23|publisher=VNU|date=11 August 1983|page=8|url=https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerNews/PersonalComputerNews023-17Aug1983/page/n11|access-date=15 September 2023}}</ref> In the fourth issue of ''Personal Computer Games'', ''Pssst'' was nominated for a 1983 game of the year list on account of Ultimate's "famous graphics". According to the reviewer, other attributes of the game included its "originality" and "fun" in comparison to other Ultimate titles that were released in 1983.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Search hots up for game of 1983|journal=Personal Computer Games|url=https://archive.org/stream/personalcomputergames-magazine-04/PersonalComputerGames_04#page/n23/mode/2up/search/pssst|date=September 1983|issue=4|page=25|access-date=30 September 2015}}</ref> In a retrospective review, a reviewer of ''Retro Games! Now'' summarised that the game "was not the best" of Ultimate's releases for the ZX Spectrum, despite considering it to be "less lauded" than the others. However, they considered ''Pssst'' to be a "taste of things to come" and a significant improvement over the "clunky" and "jumpy" animation of previous games for the ZX Spectrum.<ref name="spec">{{cite web|title = Pssst – retrospective review|url = http://www.retrogamesnow.co.uk/pssst-for-the-zx-spectrum-an-ultimate-review/|publisher = Retrogameshow|access-date = 30 September 2015|date = 16 August 2011}}</ref>
