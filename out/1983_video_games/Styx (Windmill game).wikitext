'''''Styx''''' is a [[video game]] released by [[Windmill Software]] in 1983 as a [[Copy protection|copy-protected]], bootable 5.25" floppy disk for the [[IBM PC/XT]]. It is a clone of the [[1981 in video gaming|1981]] arcade game ''[[Qix]]''. In September 2004 the [[source code]] of the game became available "for historical interest" (with other Windmill Software games such as ''[[Digger (video game)|Digger]]'').<ref>[https://www.digger.org/styxsrc_orig.zip styxsrc_orig.zip]</ref><ref>[https://www.digger.org/whatsnew.html whatsnew.html] on Digger.org</ref> Also, there is a [[Reverse Engineering|reverse engineered]] variant from Andrew Jenner, called ''Styx Remastered''.<ref>[https://www.digger.org/download.html download] on digger.org</ref>[[Image:Styx_game_screenshot.gif|thumb|upright=2|Screenshot]]

==Development==
{{Original research|section|date=June 2020}}

''Styx'' uses the same game engine as two other Windmill Software games, ''The Exterminator'' and ''Moonbugs'', and these were some of the few programs to make use of the [[Color Graphics Adapter#160Ã—100 16 color mode|16-color quasi-graphics CGA mode]] (normally the CGA could only use 4 or 2 color graphics). However, it was possible to play on a [[monochrome monitor]] as long as the graphics card also supported color graphics (e.g. a Genoa Color Graphics Card).

''Styx'', ''The Exterminator'', and ''Moonbugs'' set CGA 320x200x4 mode on the title screen by directly manipulating the video registers; this causes them to display a screen full of garbage on later video cards. The in-game graphics also will only occupy half the screen due to technical differences between CGA and EGA/VGA, however the games can be [[Patch (software)|patched]] to work correctly on VGA.
