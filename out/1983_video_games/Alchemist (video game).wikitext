'''''Alchemist''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and released by [[Imagine Software]] in 1983. The player controls an [[alchemy|alchemist]] who can shape-shift into a [[golden eagle]].

''Alchemist'' was developed by Ian Weatherburn and Paul Lindale and was Imagine's first action-adventure.<ref name=crash8>{{cite journal|journal=CRASH|date=September 1984|page=67|issue=8|title=Crashback|publisher=Newsfield}}</ref> It was the first piece of software to be released on a gold-coloured [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] and box.<ref name=su/>

== Gameplay ==

The player controls an [[Alchemy|alchemist]] who has been summoned to defeat an evil warlock. The game is set inside the warlock's castle, with the game's primary objective being finding four pieces of a magic scroll. This allows the alchemist to use the "Spell of Destruction" to defeat the warlock.

The alchemist can transform into a [[golden eagle]], requiring the use of [[magic points|spell energy]]. Transforming between the two is essential to completing the game. The alchemist can hurl lightning bolts and other spells, but the eagle form is required to negotiate steep hills or drops.<ref name=crash2>{{cite journal|journal=CRASH|issue=2|page=13|publisher=Newsfield|title=Reviews|date=March 1984}}</ref> The alchemist can only carry one item at a time and must consume food to keep [[hit points|stamina levels]] up. Movement, bumping into objects, or transforming depletes the character's stamina.<ref name=crash2/> Fighting monsters also reduces the character's stamina, although this can be mitigated by carrying an axe or sword.<ref name=crash2/>

==Reception==
''Alchemist'' was released to positive reviews from critics. Reviewers drew comparisons to ''[[Atic Atac]]'' due to the similar atmosphere and play style.<ref name=su>{{cite journal|journal=Sinclair User|title=Soft Centre|issue=24|page=iii|date=March 1984}}</ref><ref name=crash2/> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' highlighted ''Alchemist''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> cartoon graphics and storyline.<ref name=su>{{cite journal|journal=Sinclair User|title=Soft Centre|issue=24|page=iii|date=March 1984}}</ref> ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' praised the game's presentation, graphics and "spooky organ tune". While the exploration of the castle was a drawback for one reviewer, overall opinions about the game's addictiveness was mixed.<ref name=crash2/> In ''CRASH''{{'}}s 1984 retrospective, it was felt that the graphics in ''Alchemist'', whilst detailed, had not aged well. The jerky scrolling, poor keyboard layout, and lack of replayability were also criticised.<ref name=crash8/> ''[[Your Spectrum]]'' highlighted the alchemist character's graphic, and his eagle transformation animation.<ref name=yc>{{cite journal|journal=Your Spectrum|issue=3|volume=4|date=March 1984|page=70|title=ZX Spectrum Software}}</ref>
