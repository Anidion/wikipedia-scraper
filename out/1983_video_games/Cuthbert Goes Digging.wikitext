'''''Cuthbert Goes Digging''''' is a 1983 [[video game]] for the [[Dragon 32]] home computer. Written by [[Steve Bak]] at [[Microdeal]], the game features the hero [[Cuthbert (Microdeal)|Cuthbert]], who also appears in ''[[Cuthbert Goes Walkabout]]'' and ''[[Cuthbert in the Mines]]''. In the game, the player guides Cuthbert through levels of girders, avoiding 'moronians' fatal to the touch.

The gameplay is basically that of ''[[Space Panic]]'':<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cuthbert Goes Digging |url=http://www.lcurtisboyle.com/nitros9/cuthbertgoesdigging.html |access-date=2023-07-17 |website=www.lcurtisboyle.com}}</ref> Cuthbert kills moronians by digging holes and causing them to fall down. On later levels, different-colored moronians are harder to kill and must be knocked through two platforms. Cuthbert also faces a time limit on each level, represented by the amount of oxygen remaining. Cuthbert's ability to dig holes can also be used to quickly drop to a lower platform without the use of a ladder.
