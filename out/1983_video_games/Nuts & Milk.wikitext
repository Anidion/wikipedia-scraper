{{nihongo|'''''Nuts & Milk'''''|ナッツ&ミルク|Nattsu to Miruku}} is a [[puzzle-platform game]] developed and published by [[Japan]]ese [[software]] developer [[Hudson Soft]] in 1983. The game was released for the [[FM-7]], [[MSX]], [[NEC PC-8801]], [[NEC PC-6001]], and later to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in [[Japan]]. Along with ''[[Lode Runner]]'', it was the first [[Video game developer#Third-party developers|third-party]] [[video game]] to be released on a [[Nintendo]] console.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Gameplay==
{{No footnotes|section|date=May 2012}}

Both versions of ''Nuts & Milk'' involve the player moving through various levels while collecting an assortment of [[fruit]] scattered throughout each of them. By gathering all the fruit on a particular screen, the player will gain access to a previously unopened house door containing Milk's [[Engagement|fiancée]], Yogurt. When the player makes contact with the female blob, they are advanced to the next level to start the process anew. Movement through these levels is accomplished by using the directional pad or keyboard to move Milk across the stage while avoiding pitfalls and other obstacles, most notably the character's rival, Nuts. If contact is made at any time during game play with Nuts or other harmful objects such as miniature [[blimp]]s, the player will lose a life and have to restart the current level, with all fruit reset back to their initial positions. Once all three of Milk's lives are lost in this fashion, the game ends.

In the Famicom version, Milk can jump a short distance vertically or horizontally, allowing him to traverse pits or quickly gain access to an adjacent platform. If the player falls from too great a distance, Milk will become momentarily dazed and unable to move until the player joggles him awake with the jump button. Rope bridges are suspended in mid-air on most levels, and by using the directional pad, the player can climb them up or down as well as walk across them once they reach the top. In all, 50 individual levels exist on the Famicom version, and each one can be skipped freely by pressing the select button. Once a player has cycled through all fifty of them, he will return to the first level and restart the sequence until all of Milk's lives are lost.

The Famicom and MSX version also contain a level editor mode where the player can freely edit the first stage of the game by placing objects or enemies on the screen for Milk to interact with. This stage then takes the place of the first level in normal game play until the console is reset.

==Plot==
Set in a [[fantasy]] world, ''Nuts & Milk'' follows the story of a pink male blob named Milk, who must find his fiancée, Yogurt, a similar pink blob with a red hair bow, and rescue her from Nuts, a teal blob who also vies for her affection. The journey will take Milk through several levels where the process of finding and saving his love will repeat itself several times as Nuts mounts an ever-present resistance against his quest for romance.<ref name="manual">''Nuts & Milk'' NES Instruction Manual 1984.</ref>

==Development==
Originally developed by Japanese software company [[Hudson Soft]] for several [[home computer]]s in Japan, ''Nuts & Milk'' became the company's first [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] video game. The game itself borrows elements from ''[[Lode Runner]]'', an earlier Hudson project, and other [[arcade game|arcade]]-styled [[Platform game|platformer]]s such as ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and even emulates the title screen of [[Nintendo]]'s early 1980s releases. While the game retains stylistic similarities to other games published at the time, it is unique in being an arcade-styled game that was never released on an actual arcade system.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Two different versions of the game were created: one for home computers, and one for the Famicom.

===Version differences===
[[Image:nutsmilk.jpg|right|thumb|The [[MSX]] (top) and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] versions]]

''Nuts & Milk'' was released for the home computers and Nintendo's Famicom at roughly the same time, and although both versions are very similar, there are a few differences in presentation. The Famicom version is played from a sideways angle typical of [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Side-scrolling video game|sidescroller]]s with the player walking and jumping from one area to another horizontally. Conversely, the computer version is presented in a top-down fashion with all [[Platform game|platforming]] elements removed, with the player instead moving in four directions. This version also contains a slight degradation in both sound and [[computer graphics|graphics]], due to the comparatively less powerful [[personal computer]]s at the time. Though the Famicom version makes use of its standard 2-button [[Game controller|controller]], the computer releases instead rely on a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]].

===Music===
The music for both versions of ''Nuts & Milk'' was composed internally by Hudson Soft and is made up entirely of [[Synthesizer|synth]]-based [[chiptune]]s, a common audio medium for early video games. Though an exclusive soundtrack for either game was never released, the music from both versions can be found on the 1987 compilation album ''Hudson Game Music'' (catalog number 28XA-87) released in Japan by Alfa and GMO Records.<ref name="gmr">"[http://www.gmronline.com/info.asp?CatNumber=28XA-87 Hudson Game Music]" ''Game Music Revolution''. URL Accessed on November 21, 2006.</ref>

==Ports==
Hudson Soft ported the Famicom version to the Commodore 64. It was released in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1984 as ''Hot Pop'' and was later re-released by Melbourne House.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://retrocollector.org/index.php?page=1&system=1&publisher=857&release=9757|website=Retrocollector|accessdate=16 May 2021 |title=Hot Pop}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebase64.com/game.php?id=3599&d=36&h=0|website=GameBase64|accessdate=18 April 2016 |title=Hot Pop}}</ref>

==Legacy==
A version of ''Nuts & Milk'' resembling the Famicom release has since been ported to [[mobile phone]]s as a download service beginning September 1, 2003 in Japan by KG Telecom as part of their "GameMaster" compilation, which contains other Hudson Soft games from the [[8-bit]] era.<ref name="hudsonsoft">"[http://www.hudson.co.jp/corp/news/bn2003/030901.html Hudson GameMaster] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213214056/http://www.hudson.co.jp/corp/news/bn2003/030901.html |date=2006-12-13 }}" ''Hudson.co.jp''. URL Accessed on November 21, 2006.</ref> The service was later extended to other parts of the world in January 2004 by TF1 i-games.<ref name="jeuxvideo">"[http://mobile.jeuxvideo.com/articles/0000/00000271_test.htm Nuts & Milk Mobile]" ''Jeux Video''. URL Accessed on November 21, 2006.</ref>

On December 22, 2005, Hudson included ''Nuts & Milk'' in ''Hudson Collection Vol. 4: Nazotoki Collection'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]], released exclusively in Japan.
