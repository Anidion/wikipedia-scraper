After the release of [[Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0|''Flight Simulator'' for the IBM PC]], Sublogic backported its improvements to other computers as ''Flight Simulator II''.{{r|hockman198704}} This version, like the Microsoft release, does away with [[Wire-frame model|wireframe]] graphics for solid colors, and uses real-world scenery (although limited to a few areas in the United States). It includes the ability to load additional scenery from [[Floppy disk|floppy disks]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Davidson |first=John |date=February 1990 |title=Surrealism in the Sky |pages=54 |work=New Atari User |issue=42 |url=https://archive.org/details/Page6-42-Feb90/page/54/mode/2up}}</ref>

==Reception==
''[[InfoWorld]]'' in 1984 praised ''Flight Simulator II'' for the Apple as "a complicated but exhilarating game ... Bruce Artwick has really done it all", and stated that it was superior to Microsoft's version.<ref name="mace19840507">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ti4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56 | title=In Praise of Classics | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-05-07 | accessdate=6 February 2015 | author=Mace, Scott | pages=56 | archive-date=2023-08-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230802164511/https://books.google.com/books?id=ti4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Roy Wagner reviewed and compared ''[[Solo Flight (video game)|Solo Flight]]'' and ''Flight Simulator II'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "This program is outstanding and certainly one of the best examples of excellent programming, documentation, and a full use of the capabilities of a microcomputer."<ref name="CGW17">{{cite magazine |last=Wagner |first=Roy |title=Two Flight Simulators |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=August 1984 |volume=1 |issue=17 |pages=28–29, 39}}</ref>
