==Gameplay==
An alien crashed on [[Earth]] and to get back to his planet he must find the four pieces of his spacecraft. Go into the several rooms and press the button. Hopefully, a piece of the ship will show on a corner of the screen. Pick it up and repeat the procedure until you can go back home. Beware of the guardians, though, as they would follow you to trap you.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-2600-vcs-alien-s-return_7818.html | title=Atari 2600 VCS Alien's Return : Scans, dump, download, screenshots, ads, videos, catalog, instructions, roms }}</ref>
