'''''Gateway to Apshai''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[ColecoVision]] and [[Atari 8-bit computers]]. It was developed by The Connelley Group and published by [[Epyx]] in 1983 as a prequel to ''[[Temple of Apshai]]''. It is a more action-oriented version of ''Temple of Apshai'', with smoother and faster graphics, streamlined controls, fewer [[role-playing video game]] elements, and fewer room descriptions.

In ''Gateway to Apshai'' the player assumes the role of an unnamed adventurer, who tries to survive a series of increasingly [[Difficulty level|difficult]] dungeon [[Level (video games)|levels]] filled with both [[treasure]] and [[monster]]s. Each level is played within a freely selectable dungeon. Level 8 of the dungeon perpetually repeats until the player runs out of [[Life (video games)|lives]], ending the game.

==Plot==

The player's character is summoned to the chambers of an old priest called Merlis, who informs him that he is the son of the greatest warrior of Apshai, and that it is written in the prophecy that only he can reclaim the fabled Temple of Apshai and rid the land of its monsters and curses. This game covers the Gateway to Apshai, which they have to clear in order to reach the Temple of Apshai.

==Gameplay==
The player is initially armed with a [[dagger]] and clad in [[leather]] [[armour|armor]]. As play progresses, they obtain new weapons, armor, potions, eyeglasses, and scrolls containing magical spells. Various enemies, ranging from simple [[rat]]s and [[snake]]s to [[giant]]s, inhabit the dungeon. The player must kill them with weapons or magical spells.

The levels become progressively harder to survive as the player descends deeper and deeper into the dungeon. Each dungeon is covered in complete darkness that illuminates as the dungeon rooms and corridors are explored. The Gateway consists of 8 levels, each consisting of 16 dungeons, each consisting of 60 rooms, for a total of 7680 rooms.<ref name="Gateway of Apshai Overview">[http://www.rarityguide.com/articles/articles/46/1/Review-of-one-of-the-earlier-dungeon-crawls-Gateway-to-Apshai-for-the-Commodore-64/Page1.html Gateway to Apshai Review]</ref>

The player gets approximately six and a half minutes to explore each level. Once the time passes, if they are still alive, they advance to the next deeper level.
