'''''Volcanic Dungeon''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] designed by Roy Carnell and Stuart A. Galloway and released by Carnell Software for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Dragon 32/64]] and [[ZX81]] computers in 1983. It is a follow-up to 1982's ''Black Crystal''.

==Plot==
A war between the forces of good and evil has been won by the light and the dark goddess Methzar and the Snow Queen were both defeated. But the witch Magra has managed to escape with some of her army into the titular volcanic dungeon, taking with her a captive elfin princess named Edora. The task of a hero known as the Knight of Star Jewel is to hunt down and kill Magra, and to rescue Edora from her glass coffin.

==Reception==
According to a ''[[Sinclair User]]'' [[ZX-81]] retrospective in 1985, "''Volcanic'' deserves recognition as the first graphics adventure for the ZX-81, and therefore one of the first of all adventures. Unfortunately, the game mechanics are rather crude and it is frequently a matter of good fortune."<ref>''Sinclair User'' Annual 1985, page 54.</ref>  In a "Favourites of Yesteryear" article that same year, ''Sinclair User'' rated it 5/10, complaining of the game's slowness and how "death is always too swift. It is as if the computer is playing  the player and not the other way around."<ref>''Sinclair User'' 27 (June 1984), page 38.</ref>

==Legacy==
''Volcanic Dungeon'' was the second part of the 'Third Continent Trilogy';<ref>{{cite web |title=Third Continent Trilogy |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/third-continent-trilogy |website=Moby Games}}</ref> See also ''[[Black Crystal]]'', 1982 and, ''[[The Wrath of Magra]]'', 1984.
