''Big Top'' features a circus "big top" theme. The user plays the part of a clown with the job of gathering all the hats on each ladder-filled level&mdash;where, in keeping with the theme, levels are called ''rings''. Each ring spans across at least two screens and has an upper and lower level. Obstacles include evil clowns, cannons, and rolling barrels.
