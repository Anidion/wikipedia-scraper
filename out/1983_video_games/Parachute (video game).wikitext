'''''Parachute''''' (aka '''''Von Himmel durch die Hoelle''''') is a [[video game]] released in 1983 by Homevision for the [[Atari 2600]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Parachute , Atari 2600 cart. by HomeVision(1983) |url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=parachute-model-vcs-83123&page=detail&id=50774 |access-date=2024-02-11 |website=www.arcade-history.com}}</ref> The game puts the player in the role of parachutist who is falling gently from the sky.

In order to land safely, the player must evade aeroplanes, helicopters, birds and [[hot-air balloon]]s. After successfully navigating several screens that progressively increase in speed, the parachutist finally emerges near ground level. In order to achieve a safe landing, the player must simultaneously avoid touching the pacing guard at the bottom while positioning the parachuter on the ground. A higher point bonus is awarded if the parachuter lands near the center of the screen. After landing, the game begins again at an increased difficulty level.

''Parachute'' is one of a few Atari 2600 games to employ in-game [[background music]]. The main theme loops throughout the game while occasionally changing [[Pitch (music)|pitch]].
