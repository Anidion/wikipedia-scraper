{{Nihongo foot|'''''Baseball'''''|ベースボール|Bēsubōru|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[video game]] from [[Nintendo]]. It was released December 7, 1983, after the July 15 [[launch game|launch]] of the [[Famicom]] in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cornelius|first=Dylan|date=April 21, 2020|title=Baseball (Famicom, 1983)|url=https://retrogamingarchive.org/2020/04/21/nintendo-is-great-baseball-famicom-1983/|access-date=March 7, 2021|website=Retro Gaming Archive|language=en-US}}{{Dead link|date=September 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1984, it was ported to the [[Nintendo VS. System|VS. System]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] as '''''VS. Baseball''''' with additional graphics and speech, becoming a number one hit in Japan and North America that year. It was localized as a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] launch game in North America in 1985,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Matt|date=March 28, 2020|title=All 30 Black Box Nes Games Guide (Including Pricing)|url=https://www.mcmrose.com/the-ultimate-black-box-nes-games-guide/|access-date=March 7, 2021|website=MCMROSE|language=en-US}}</ref> and in Europe in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NES Game List (Europe) {{!}} NinDB|url=https://nindb.net/nes/games-eu.html|access-date=March 7, 2021|website=nindb.net}}</ref> ''IGN'' said the universal appeal of the American sport made ''Baseball'' a key to the NES's successful test market introduction, and an important piece of Nintendo history.<ref name="NES Baseball at IGN"/> The game was also competing with [[Sega]]'s arcade hit ''[[Champion Baseball]]'', released earlier in 1983.

==Gameplay==
As in real [[baseball]], the object of the game is to score the most runs. The game supports one player versus a computer opponent, or two players. Each player can select from one of six teams.

Though lacking a license of official team names,<ref name="NES Baseball at IGN"/> their initials in the game correspond to the Japanese [[Central League]] or the American [[Major League Baseball]] teams in their respective regions. The only gameplay difference between teams is the uniform colors.<ref name="NES Baseball at GameSpot"/>

==Development and release==
[[Shigeru Miyamoto]] recalled that in 1983, he "personally really wanted there to be a ''Baseball'' game" for the [[Famicom]], and was "directly in charge of the character design and the game design". The Famicom had only three [[launch games|launch day games]] on July 15, 1983, and ''Baseball'' was released on December 7{{mdash}}totaling seven games by 1984.<ref name="Miyamoto Spills"/>

At the [[History of the Nintendo Entertainment System#North American launch (1985–1986)|1985 launch]] of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in the [[Manhattan]] initial test market, the game was featured prominently among 17 total games. It was demonstrated on a large projector screen, by real [[Major League Baseball]] athletes who played the video game and signed autographs for fans. Because the video game industry was so young and had [[Video game crash of 1983|crashed in America in 1983]], and because some other NES launch games like ''[[Clu Clu Land]]'' have abstract fantasy themes that are not instantly recognizable by a new audience, the presence of a traditional American pastime was said to be an instantly relatable aid to the system's introduction.<ref name="NES Baseball at IGN"/>

It was ported to the arcade [[Nintendo VS. System|VS. System]] as ''VS. Baseball'' in 1984, competing with [[Sega]]'s popular ''[[Champion Baseball]]'' (1983).<ref name="BDK">{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=Beyond Donkey Kong: A History of Nintendo Arcade Games |date=August 6, 2020 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-8420-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3D0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA132}}</ref>{{rp|132–5}}

In 2007, ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Baseball'' a 5.5 out of 10, noting its depth of pitching, its two-player support, "its still-intact sense of fun", and its important place in Nintendo's history. The review said that the [[History of the Nintendo Entertainment System#North American launch|1985 test market launch]] of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] had "heavily relied upon" ''Baseball'', due to the globally recognizable status of the sport. The review summarized that "the NES came out a winner—thanks, in part, to ''Baseball''".<ref name="NES Baseball at IGN">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/17/baseball-vc-review|first=Lucas M.|last=Thomas|title=Baseball VC Review |publisher=[[IGN]]|date=January 16, 2007|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}</ref>

In 2006, ''[[GameSpot]]'' gave ''Baseball'' a 4.2 out of 10, stating that while it was easy to play, the "bare-bones" replica of the sport "hasn't withstood the test of time".<ref name="NES Baseball at GameSpot">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baseball-review/1900-6163754/|first=Aaron|last=Thomas|title=Baseball Review|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=January 4, 2007|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 2020, historian Ken Horowitz said ''VS. Baseball'' (1984) lacks certain features of the competing Sega's ''Champion Baseball'' (1983), but has superior [[multiplayer]] capabilities.<ref name="BDK"/>

''Baseball'' was a significant source of inspiration for [[Namco]]'s ''[[Pro Baseball: Family Stadium]]'' (1986) for Famicom, which became the ''[[R.B.I. Baseball]]'' series.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Szczepaniak |first1=John |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |date=August 11, 2014 |isbn=978-0992926007 |pages=363 |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |edition=First}}</ref>
