'''''Super Rider''''' is a [[racing game|racing]] [[arcade game]] developed by Daiei Seisakusho and released by [[Taito]] in 1983. The game was licensed to Venture Line for [[United States|U.S.]] distribution.

==Gameplay==
The player takes the role of a biker boy who must cross a road with obstacles and a very blocky background in order to buy a present for his girlfriend. The bike is able to jump to avoid the obstacles (cans, logs, police cars, etc.) and gaps in the road.

Sixty seconds are given to finish the course. After buying the present, the player is given 30 seconds plus the remaining time to cross the course again and go back home.

After this, the player will have a chance of crossing a bonus course with many money bags. Finishing the course without crashing any vehicle will be awarded with extra points. If the player manages to score 200.000 points, a credit is added.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Super Rider'' on their June 15, 1983 issue as being the fifth most-successful new table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型新製品 (New Videos-Table Type)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=214|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 June 1983|page=27|lang=ja}}</ref>
