'''''Broadsides''''' is a video game that simulates naval combat in the [[Age of Sail]]. It was published by [[Strategic Simulations]] in 1983 for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Apple II]], and [[Commodore 64]].

==Gameplay==

Giant warships circle each other, waiting for the best time to unleash a [[Broadside (naval)|broadside]] upon the enemy. Cannons can be loaded with various types of [[ammunition|ordnance]]; [[Round shot|cannonballs]] to destroy the hull, [[chain shot]] to destroy the [[sail]]s, and [[grapeshot]] to kill the enemy crew.

The player can also close with the enemy ship and attempt [[boarding (assault)|boarding]]. This aspect of the game plays a lot like [[rock-paper-scissors]], where the player controls one crew member and which sort of attack he makes with his sword. This is compared against the enemy attack, and the results are used to decrease the crew count on one side. Once one side's crew is all dead, the other side is the victor.

The game also offers a simplified, arcade-combat mode in which the player fights an endless number of enemy ships.{{r|long198312}}
