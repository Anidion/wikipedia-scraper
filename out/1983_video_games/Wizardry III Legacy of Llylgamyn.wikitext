'''''Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn''''' (originally known as '''''Wizardry: Legacy of Llylgamyn - The Third Scenario''''') is the third scenario in the ''[[Wizardry]]'' series of [[role-playing video game]]s. It was published in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]] by [[Sir-Tech]].

==Plot==
The City of Llylgamyn is threatened by the violent forces of nature. Earthquakes and volcanic rumblings endanger everyone. Only by seeking the dragon L'Kbreth can the city be saved.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wizardry III - Legacy of Llylgamyn |url=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Wizardry_III_-_Legacy_of_Llylgamyn_1983}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}

''Legacy of Llylgamyn'' is another six-level [[dungeon crawl]], although the dungeon is a volcano so the party journeys upwards rather than downwards.  The gameplay and the spells are identical to the first two scenarios.  Parties of up to six characters can adventure at one time.

Characters have to be imported from either ''[[Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord]]'' or ''[[Wizardry II: The Knight of Diamonds]]''. However, since the game is set years later, the characters are actually the descendants of the original characters. They keep the same name and class, can select a new [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]] (class permitting), and are reset to level one.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn - Guides and FAQs |url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/msx/918219-wizardry-iii-legacy-of-llylgamyn/faqs}}</ref>

==Development==
''Wizardry III'' is the first adventure game with a [[window manager]], released before the first [[Mac gaming|games on the Macintosh]].<ref name="mace19840402">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56 | title=Games with windows | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-04-02 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | author=Mace, Scott | pages=56}}</ref> The game was delayed by a year for using the technology.<ref name="mattchat1">{{cite web |last1=Barton |first1=Matt |title=Matt Chat 246: Robert Sirotek on Wizardry 1-5 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKQgDCbcJ1o  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/kKQgDCbcJ1o |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=[[Google]] |access-date=18 September 2021 |date=23 June 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Llylgamyn was originally a typo, it was supposed to be spelled with only one L.<ref name="mattchat1"/>

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' in 1983 praised ''Llylgamyn'', stating that it "wasn't written; it was composed ... The dungeon feels like a living, breathing entity", and concluding that the game "is the best ''Wizardry'' yet".<ref name="tommervik19830708">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=6&id=12 | title=Legacy of Llylgamyn | work=Softline | date=Jul–Aug 1983 | accessdate=28 July 2014 | author=Tommervik, Margot Comstock | pages=23}}</ref>

Robert Reams reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The Legacy of Llylgamyn is an example of the maturing and improvement of an already excellent product. This new adventure will challenge all who accept this quest and will leave you looking for the two sequels which follow in its path."<ref name="CGW13">{{cite magazine |last=Reams |first=Robert |title=Legacy of Llylgamyn: An Introduction to Wizardry's Third Scenario |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=December 1983 |volume=1 |issue=13 |pages=28–29}}</ref>

Philip L.

It has a solid story, with riddles, appropriate to the scenario. This game is recommended for those who have the original, but characters with solid stats from the first two games are required."<ref name="SG"/>

In 1984 ''Softline'' readers named the game the second most-popular Apple program of 1983, behind ''[[Lode Runner]]''.<ref name="stgame19840304">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&pub=6&id=16 | title=The Best and the Rest | work=St.Game | date=Mar–Apr 1984 | accessdate=28 July 2014 | pages=49}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] in 1991 and 1993 called the game "''Wizardry I'' all over again, with a few bells and whistles added". She stated that other than the novelty of playing two separate groups of adventurers, one good and one evil, "there is little to distinguish it from the previous two games".{{r|scorpia199110}}<ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | accessdate=25 March 2016 | author=Scorpia | pages=34–50}}</ref>
