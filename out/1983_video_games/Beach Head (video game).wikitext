'''''Beach-Head''''' is a [[video game]] developed and published in 1983 by [[Access Software]] for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and [[Commodore 64]] in the US. Versions for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[Acorn Electron]] (as well as the Atari and C64 versions) were published in Europe by [[U.S. Gold]] in 1984, followed by versions for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 16]] and [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]] in 1985.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Beach Head A800 ingame.png|left|thumb|Tank on the run to the enemy gun.]]
The game's setting is the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Ocean theater]] of [[World War II]].<ref name="zzap64.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=006&amp;page=062&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap|title=Beach Head|publisher=Newsfield|work=[[Zzap64]]|page=62|year=1985|issue=6}}</ref> Gameplay consists of several varying stages in which the player must control various vehicles including warships and tanks in order to defeat an enemy fleet, break through enemy beach defences and destroy an enormous gun-emplacement to win the game. The gun emplacement requires multiple hits to be destroyed, but traverses faster than tanks can aim and fire, so it cannot be destroyed in a single attempt. In order to complete the game multiple tanks must make it through to the final level.

==Reception==
''Beach-Head'' was Access' best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987.<ref name="ferrell198712">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-12-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_54_1987_Dec#page/n17/mode/2up | title=The Commodore Games That Live On And On | work=Compute's Gazette | date=December 1987 | accessdate=24 January 2015 | author=Ferrell, Keith | pages=18–22}}</ref> It was the first U.S. Gold release to sell 250,000 copies.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=History in the Making: The First Three Years | magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] | date=16 August 1988 | issue=83 (September 1988) | page=51 | url=https://archive.org/details/computer-video-games-magazine-083/page/n50/mode/1up}}</ref>

''[[Ahoy!]]'' stated "This game is a blast". It praised the graphics and concluded: "It is a remarkable programming achievement".<ref name="peterson198404">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_04_1984-04_Ion_International_US#page/n61/mode/2up | title=Beach-Head | work=Ahoy! | date=April 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Peterson, Cheryl | pages=63}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' listed the game in May 1988 as one of "Our Favorite Games", stating that it was superior to its "many imitators".{{r|compute198805}}

''Zzap!64'' reviewed the game in a retrospective feature in October 1985. They argued that although it was considered impressive at the time of release it had already become dated, and was rated 70% overall.<ref name="zzap64.co.uk"/>

In 1996, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' declared ''Beach Head'' the 117th-best computer game ever released.<ref name=cgw150>{{cite magazine | author=Staff | title=150 Best (and 50 Worst) Games of All Time | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=November 1996 | issue=148 | pages=63–65, 68, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 94, 98}}</ref>

==Legacy==
A sequel, ''[[Beach Head II: The Dictator Strikes Back]]'', was released in 1985.
