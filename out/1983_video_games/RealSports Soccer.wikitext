==Development==
The game was part of [[RealSports|a series of games released under the ''RealSports'' title]] for the Atari 2600, including ''[[RealSports Football]]'', ''[[RealSports Volleyball]]'', and ''[[RealSports Baseball]]''.<ref name="Best 2600 Sports">{{cite news |title=Best 2600 Sports |url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_Illustrated_1983-04_Ion_International_US/page/n59/mode/2up?q=%22Realsports%22 |access-date=February 24, 2021 |work=Videogaming Illustrated |date=April 1983 |page=60}}</ref><ref name="Stanton et al" /> With the launch of the Atari 5200 a new version of the game was also developed for it, originally known simply as ''Soccer''.  The game was Atari's second association football-themed game after ''[[Pelé's Soccer]]''.<ref name="Lapetino" />

The 2600 version was programmed by Michael Sierchio,<ref name="Retro Gamer" /> with the computer-graphics being designed by Jerome Domurat.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} The 5200 version was programmed by John Seghers.<ref name="Retro Gamer" /> The game was written in [[machine code]].<ref name="Stanton et al" /> The original cover for the 2600 version was designed by Warren Chang,<ref name="Moby">{{cite web |title=RealSports Soccer Credits (Atari 2600) |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/realsports-soccer/credits |website=Moby Games |access-date=February 25, 2021}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|sure=y|reason=[[WP:VG/RS]]|date=September 2021}} whilst the cover for the 5200 version was designed by Steve Hendricks.<ref name="Lapetino" /> A version for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was also in development, but was it was cancelled in hope that it would sell more 5200 systems.<ref name="Retro Gamer">{{cite journal |last=Jainschigg |first=John |title=The History of RealSports |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=183 |date=August 2018 |pages=44–49 }}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The game includes only three players a side, with no human-controlled goal keeper. The gameplay scrolls horizontally over a play-area roughly three screens wide.<ref name="Stanton et al" /> During play the human player controls the [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] with the ball, whilst the computer AI controls the sprites of the players that are off the ball. To switch player the player selects the player nearest to the ball by pressing a joystick button, though the player is selected automatically by a successful pass.<ref name="Telematch" /> The Atari 5200 version featured computer-controlled goal-keepers.<ref name="Kunkel">{{cite book |editor1-last=Kunkel |editor1-first=Bill |editor1-link=Bill Kunkel (journalist) |title=1984 Software Encyclopedia |date=1984 |publisher=Reese Communications Inc. |pages=105 |url=https://archive.org/details/1984_Software_Encyclopedia_Number_2_1983_Reese_Communications_US/page/n103/mode/2up?q=Soccer |access-date=February 25, 2021}}</ref>

==Reception==
A review of ''RealSports Soccer'' in the March 1983 issue of the UK magazine ''TV Gamer'' criticised the high price of the game (nearly £30, or roughly £100 at 2020 prices),<ref>{{cite web |title=Bank of England Inflation Calculator |url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator |website=bankofengland.co.uk |access-date=February 25, 2021}}</ref> and summed up their impression of the game by saying "it's just football".<ref name="TV Gamer">{{cite news |title=RealSports Soccer: New! |url=https://archive.org/details/tv-gamer-magazine-1983-02/page/n33/mode/2up?q=realsports |access-date=February 25, 2021 |work=TV Gamer |date=February 1983 |page=32}}</ref> The German magazine ''Telematch'', in an April 1983 review criticised the lack of goalkeepers, the small play-area, and the general lack of realism in the game, ultimately giving the game a score of 4/6.<ref name="Telematch">{{cite news |title=RealSports Soccer: Ansatsweise Mini-Fussball |url=https://www.kultpower.de/archiv/heft_telematch_1983-04_seite19 |access-date=February 25, 2021 |work=Telematch |date=April 1983 |page=18 |language=German}}</ref> A May 1983 review in the French gaming magazine ''Tilt'' also criticised the lack-lustre gameplay, though it praised the improved graphics over Atari's previous game, ''Pelé's Soccer''. ''Tilt'' gave the game 4/5 for graphics but only 2/5 for its ability to hold interest.<ref name="Tilt">{{cite news |title=Football |url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Tilt/tilt_numero005/Tilt%20005%20-%20Page%20017%20(1983-05-06).jpg |access-date=February 25, 2021 |work=Tilt |issue=5 |date=May 1983 |page=17 |language=French |quote=Nb. the title is "Football", but from the picture and the description this is clearly RealSports Soccer}}</ref> The 1984 ''Book of Atari Software'' criticised the lack of realism in ''RealSports Soccer'' for the 2600 platform, saying that it "lack[ed] the complexity and players to hold anyone's interest", and gave the game an overall score of "D".<ref name="Stanton et al">{{cite book |last1=Stanton |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Wells |first2=Robert P. |last3=Rochowansky |first3=Sandra |last4=Mellin |first4=Michael |title=The Book of Atari Software 1984 |date=1984 |publisher=The Book Company |isbn=0912003049 |page=383 |url=https://archive.org/details/the-book-of-atari-software-1984/page/n383/mode/2up |access-date=February 20, 2021}}</ref> A review in the ''1984 Software Encyclopedia'' was broadly positive about the game, particularly in head-to-head mode, giving it 7/10 overall.<ref name="Kunkel" />

An article in the November/December 1992 edition of ''Digital Press'' listed the game as one of the worst ever made for the Atari 2600, criticising especially the poor graphics, sound, gameplay, and controls.<ref name="Oleniacz">{{cite news |last1=Oleniacz |first1=Kevin |title=The worst of the Atari 2600, part 2 of 3 |url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/newsletters/digitalpress/dp2.pdf |access-date=February 25, 2021 |work=Digital Press |date=November–December 1992 |page=4}}</ref> A review of the Atari 5200 version of the game in the November/December 1997 edition of ''Digital Press'' was mildly more positive, praising the improved graphics over the Atari 2600 version, and the impressive (for its day) analog controls, though also criticising the ease of scoring against the computer in the one-player version of the game, and gave it 5/10 overall.<ref name="Cooper">{{cite news |last1=Cooper |first1=Jeff |title=RealSports Soccer |url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/newsletters/digitalpress/dp34.pdf |access-date=February 25, 2021 |work=Digital Press |issue=34 |date=November–December 1997 |page=18}}</ref>
