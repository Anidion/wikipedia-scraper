{{nihongo foot|'''''10-Yard Fight'''''|10ヤードファイト|Ten Yādo Faito|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[List of American football video games|American football]] [[sports video game]] that was developed and published in Japan by [[Irem (company)|Irem]] for [[arcade game|arcades]] in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]]. It was published overseas by [[Taito]] in the [[Americas]], by Electrocoin in Europe, and by ADP Automaten [[GmbH]] in [[West Germany]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Overseas Readers Column|magazine=Game Machine|issue=230|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 February 1984|pages=29–30|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840215p.pdf#page=15}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Arcade 10 Yard Fight.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of ''10-Yard Fight'' (arcade version)]]
''10-Yard Fight'' is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either [[offense (sports)|offense]] or [[defense (sports)|defense]]. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempts to run with the [[quarterback]], toss the ball to a [[running back]], or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver – basically the [[option offense]]. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]ed or a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] can be attempted.

The game has five levels of increasing difficulty: [[High school football|high school]], [[College football|college]], [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional]], [[National Football League playoffs|playoff]], and [[Super Bowl]]. If the player wins both halves of an "accelerated real time" 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advances to the next level of difficulty, like a [[career mode]].

A player scores 20,000 points for any kickoff that is returned for a touchdown.

==Ports==
The arcade game was later ported to the [[Famicom]] by Irem first in Japan, and later published in North America and [[Europe]] by [[Nintendo]] in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). The arcade game was also ported to the [[MSX]] home computer also by Irem, but exclusively in Japan.

While graphically similar, there are some fundamental differences between the arcade and NES versions of the game. The arcade version only seeks to simulate the offense, with the team attempting to score a touchdown, which ultimately leads the player to the next level. The NES version was developed to allow both defense and offense, as well as a simultaneous 2-player mode.

''10-Yard Fight'' was, along with ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung Fu]]'', one of only two NES launch titles not originally developed by Nintendo. Both games were developed initially for arcades by Irem. Although Nintendo developed the NES port of ''Kung Fu'', Irem handled the system's port of ''10-Yard Fight''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How NES launch negotiations, Tetris, and Lode Runner inspired boutique game publisher Tozai|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/2/4/18201436/tozai-games-history-r-type-lode-runner-spelunker|access-date=2021-07-03|website=www.polygon.com|date=4 February 2019|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-12-13|title=IGN: 10-Yard Fight|url=http://cheats.ign.com/objects/489/489907.html|access-date=2021-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213225604/http://cheats.ign.com/objects/489/489907.html|archive-date=2010-12-13}}</ref>
