'''''Cassette 50''''' (released in Spain as '''''Galaxy 50 - 50 Excitantes Juegos''''') is a compilation of games published by Cascade Games  in 1983 for multiple 8-bit home computers. It was promoted based on the quantity of games included, all of which were programmed in [[BASIC]] and were of poor quality. According to the instructions, "the games will provide many hours of entertainment for all the family at a fraction of the cost of other computer games".<ref>[ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/c/Cassette50.txt Cassette 50 inlay text]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The compilation was heavily advertised in home computer magazines. Buyers received a [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] digital [[calculator watch]] with each purchase.

In an interview, Matthew Lewis, the author of ''Galaxy Defence'', said he wrote the game when he was 14 and submitted it in response to a small, anonymous ad in a local newspaper. He was paid Â£10 for his game, but he had to give up all [[copyright|rights]] to it. ''Galaxy Defence'' took 12 hours to code and the graphics were done by his father, Ernest Lewis.<ref>[http://pixelatron.com/blog/cassette-50-the-interview/ Cassette 50: the interview | pixeltron]</ref>

==Content==
The games featured differed depending on the platform, all of which were written in [[BASIC]]. Some like ''Star Trek'' and ''Maze Eater'' appeared on all versions. Others like ''[[Lunar Lander (video game genre)|Lunar Lander]]'' were ports or clones of very early or popular games, while others were sourced from independent developers. Some games that had the same title were entirely different depending on which version. Some games also had playability issues.

The games ''Exchange'' and ''The Force'', although listed on the inlay, are missing from the Acorn Electron version, meaning only 48 games actually appeared on the cassette. There was a second release of the Dragon 32 version which had different versions of some of the games. ''Tunnel Escape'' on the C64 version is credited as such in the game's inlay but is credited as "''Escape or Bust''" in the actual game.

''Star Trek'' is shown in the cassette booklet as ''Startrek'' and ''Jet Mobile'' as ''Jetmobile''.

==Reception==
The games, almost without exception written in [[BASIC]], were deemed to be of poor quality. They have been described as "so bad it caused physical discomfort",<ref>[http://www.rewindmag.co.uk/issue1/features/cassette50_1.php Rewind Issue 1: Cassette 50 III] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206181152/http://www.rewindmag.co.uk/issue1/features/cassette50_1.php |date=February 6, 2007 }}</ref> "beyond awful",<ref>[http://www.peejays-remakes.co.uk/blitz50/blitz50.html Blitz 50] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401024933/http://www.peejays-remakes.co.uk/blitz50/blitz50.html |date=April 1, 2007 }}</ref> and "a piece of crap collection".<ref>[http://www.tigsource.com/articles/2006/08/10/somewhere-beyond-cassette-50 TIGSource: Somewhere Beyond Cassette 50]</ref> The poor quality of the games inspired the annual Crap Games Competitions<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/06/people-competing-to-make-the-worst-computer-games-possible | title = 'It's fun to cook up the stupidest idea': the people competing to make the worst computer games possible | first = Rich | last = Pelley | date =  July 6, 2023 | accessdate = January 12, 2024 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref> (for example the comp.sys.sinclair Crap Games Competition<ref>[http://lofi-gaming.org.uk/speccy/csscgc/ The CSS Crap Games Competition]</ref> and the C64 Crap Game Compo<ref>[http://www.pouet.net/party.php?which=1144&when=2005 C64 Crap Game Compo 2005]</ref>) and a now-defunct site reviewing bad games.<ref>[http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/2980 Collection of links to Internet Archive] for now-defunct site [http://www.halloftwats.co.uk/ Somewhere beyond Cassette 50] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210330044123/http://www.halloftwats.co.uk/ |date=2021-03-30 }}</ref>
