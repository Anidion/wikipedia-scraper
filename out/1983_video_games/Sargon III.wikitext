'''''Sargon III''''' is a [[computer chess]] program. It is a sequel to ''[[Sargon II (video game)|Sargon II]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Sargon III'' allots a time budget based on which level of play is chosen.<ref name="softalk"/> It has nine levels, each of which can be played in hard or easy mode.<ref name="analog"/> It has an average response time of five seconds per move on the lowest level, and an unlimited amount of time on the highest level.<ref name="gazette"/> Players can take back moves, ask for help, or force the computer's move.<ref name="commodore"/> It features a 2-D display.<ref name="ace"/> It recreates 107 great chess matches for players to study.<ref name="family"/>

==Development==
''Sargon III'' was a complete rewrite from scratch. Instead of an ''[[Exchange (chess)|exchange]] evaluator'', this version used a ''capture search'' [[algorithm]]. Also included was a [[chess opening]] repertoire. This third version was written originally for the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] assembler and was commercially published by [[Hayden Software]] in 1983. Apple contacted the Spracklens and, after a port for [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[assembly language|assembly]], ''Sargon III'' was the first third-party executable software for the [[Macintosh]].<ref name='CHM Interview'>
