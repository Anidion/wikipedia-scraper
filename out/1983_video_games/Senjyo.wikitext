{{nihongo|'''''Senjyo'''''|センジョー|'Battlefield'|stylized in all capital letters as "SENJYO"}} is an [[arcade game|arcade]] [[shooter game]] developed and released in 1983 by Tehkan (now known as [[Tecmo]]). The title, the Japanese word for "battlefield", is written in the [[kunrei-shiki]] romanization style. In the [[Hepburn Romanization|Hepburn]] style, it would be written as "Senjō".

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay involves the player controlling a fixed turret on a tank shooting oncoming alien enemies through a [[Reticle|cross-hair]] target. A certain number of enemies must be destroyed to progress to the next stage. The original arcade cabinet was a cocktail table.

The game employs the use of [[pseudo-3D]] graphical effects to give the illusion of a three-dimensional landscape. However, the player's tank is fixed in a single location, whereas the enemies can move across the landscape.<ref name="VG"/>

== Release ==
The arcade game was released in Japan in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |title=Video Game Flyers: Senjyo, Tehkan (Japan) |url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2986&image=2 |website=The Arcade Flyer Archive |access-date=11 May 2021}}</ref> In North America, it was demonstrated at AMOA 1984.<ref name="VG"/> The game was ported and published by [[Sony|Sony Corporation]] in 1984 for [[MSX]] computers. In 2005, Senjyo was re-released exclusively on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], as part of the [[Tecmo Classic Arcade]] collection.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Senjyo'' on their January 1, 1984 issue as being the second most-successful new table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型新製品 (New Videos-Table Type)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=227|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 January 1984|page=37|lang=ja}}</ref>

Zelmo of ''Video Games'' magazine reviewed the arcade game following its AMOA 1984 demonstration, comparing the gameplay favorably with the 1983 [[Atari 2600]] games ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' and ''[[Robot Tank]]'' while praising the "very nice" graphics, effects and "three-dimensional" landscape. However, the reviewer said the player's "restricted movement" compared to "the maneuverability of the various enemies" made it "frustrating" and could limit the game's arcade audience, concluding that, for "the home this effort would have some promise, but as an arcade game it might be just a little off base."<ref name="VG">{{cite magazine |author1=Zelmo |title=Design Trends On View for '84 |magazine=Video Games |date=February 1984 |volume=2 |issue=5 |publisher=Pumpkin Press |location=United States |pages=48–51 |url=https://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Volume_2_Number_05_1984-02_Pumpkin_Press_US/page/n47/mode/2up}}</ref>
