'''Henhouse''' is a 1983 [[video game]] produced by Funware for the [[TI-99/4A]] home computer.

In 1983, there were three companies interested in buying out Funware: [[Activision]], [[Epyx]], and [[Creative Software]]. Funware was eventually sold to Creative Software. However, both Epyx and Activision would later market TI-99/4A games independently near the end of 1983.<ref name=vgh>{{cite web |title=Henhouse |url=https://www.videogamehouse.net/gamemain/cartsfh/henhouse/ |website=Video Game Warehouse |access-date=October 26, 2021}}</ref> According to Michael Brouthers, it only cost Funware {{USD|4}} to make each game cartridge.<ref name=vgh/>

== Gameplay ==
The object is to collect the eggs as they drop from the henhouse and carry them to the truck while you shoot the two- and four-legged predators that stalk the henhouse.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Tyle |first1=Sherrie |title=Fun and Games with the TI-99/4A |journal=Creative Computing |date=September 1983 |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=135 |url=https://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n9/135_Fun_and_games_with_the_TI.php}}</ref>
