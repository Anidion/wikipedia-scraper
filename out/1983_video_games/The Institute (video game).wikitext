'''''The Institute''''' is a [[graphic adventure game]] published in 1983 by Screenplay for the [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Atari 8-bit computers]].

==Gameplay==
The user navigates their character through a [[Graph theory|graph]] of rooms by entering commands with the keyboard: "N", "W", "S", and "E" are used to move respectively north, west, south, and east; simple text commands to interact and investigate objects within the rooms such as "open door" are also used.

The game's protagonist is a mental patient trying to escape from the institute (hence the title). A good deal of the game takes place in drug-induced hallucinations, though in some versions the drug is a "strange powder" that sends you into "dreams".
