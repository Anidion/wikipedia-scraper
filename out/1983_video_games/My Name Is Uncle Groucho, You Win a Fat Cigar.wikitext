'''''My Name Is Uncle Groucho, You Win a Fat Cigar''''' is a [[computer game]] developed and published by [[Automata UK]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1983. ''Groucho'' was designed by [[Mel Croucher]] who was better known for his later works ''[[Deus Ex Machina (video game)|Deus Ex Machina]]'' and ''[[ID (video game)|ID]]''.

The game takes the form of a text (augmented by primitive "graphics") adventure where the player seeks out Groucho (based on [[Groucho Marx]]), who gives the player a series of clues as to the identity of a famous film star. If the player guesses correctly another clue to a further star is provided. The name of this additional star could be mailed to [[Automata UK]] for entry into a [[sweepstakes|prize draw]] to take place on 1 June 1984. The first prize was a trip to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] on [[Concorde]] to meet the actor identified, with a return trip on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2|QE2]]''.

The competition was won by Phil Daley, who correctly identified [[Mickey Mouse]] and provided the winning [[pun]] slogan "There's no blood in our games, it's [[automata|all tomata]] sauce".<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Sinclair User|issue=30|url=http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/030/news.htm|title=Daley goes to Hollywood|date=September 1984|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813054836/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/030/news.htm|archivedate=2012-08-13}}</ref>
