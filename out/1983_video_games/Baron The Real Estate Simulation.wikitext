==Reception==
Johnny Wilson reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "I question whether it is probable that the housing market would be down at the same time as interest rates are down, yet Baron afforded me that frustrating environment. I would certainly like to see some of the figures on the data collection for the correlation between interest rates and the market."<ref name="CGW16">{{cite magazine |last=Wilson |first=Johnny |title=To Market, To Market, To Buy a Fat Pig |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=June 1984 |volume=1 |issue=16 |pages=21, 38}}</ref>
