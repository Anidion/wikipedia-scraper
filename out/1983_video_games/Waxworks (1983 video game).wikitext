'''''Waxworks''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] game by [[Brian Howarth]] and Cliff J. Ogden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=7174|title = Waxworks at Spectrum Computing - Sinclair ZX Spectrum games, software and hardware}}</ref> It was published by [[Digital Fantasia]] in [[1983 in video games|1983]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[BBC Micro]].<ref>{{WoS game|name=Waxworks|id=0007174}}</ref>  It was the 11th game in the Mysterious Adventures series.<ref name=cuser03>{{cite journal|title=Waxworks review|url=https://archive.org/stream/03-your-commodore-magazine/Your_Commodore_Issue_03_1984_Dec#page/n47/mode/2up|journal=Commodore User|pages=48|issue=3|date=December 1984}}</ref>

The story is about a [[Wax museum|waxworks]] in which the protagonist is trapped. Escaping involves finding statues of famous people (like [[Edmund Hillary|Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay|Tenzing]]).

Whilst some of the statues are exceptionally easy to identify, others are not so simple without acquiring the necessary clues earlier in the game. For example, identifying the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] is exceptionally problematic without first finding a clue to his whereabouts.

==Reception==
''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' magazine reviewed ''Waxworks'' in the July 1984 issue. The text parser was described as "eccentric" but with "some noteworthy flexibility", being a modified verb/noun form that also allows adverbs and conjunctions ("QUICKLY GET THE LAMP, SWORD, CLOAK AND STAFF", for example). The graphical display was also highlighted, making up for the absence of long room descriptions.<ref>"Waxworks" review; CRASH issue 6, pp77; July 1984</ref>

''[[Your Commodore]]'' thought the game was not as good as the ''[[Zork]]'' series and with inferior graphics to rival title ''[[Dallas Quest]]''.  Overall it was considered to be "a standard adventure with standard graphics."<ref name=cuser03/>

''Personal Computer Games'' said the game had good graphics, but they took a while to draw so the option to skip them was useful. They also noticed that the response to commands was "nice and fast." The reviewer thought it likely that the game would become as much of a favourite as the other titles in the series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/personalcomputergames-magazine-08/PersonalComputerGames_08#page/n91/mode/2up|title = Personal Computer Games Magazine Issue 08}}</ref>
