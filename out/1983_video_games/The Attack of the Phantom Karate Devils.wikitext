'''''The Attack of the Phantom Karate Devils''''' is a video game developed by John Orthel for the [[Commodore 64]]  and published by Phantom Software in 1983. It is a single-player game, with a side view similar to modern fighting games. Using a joystick the player can move and perform various attacks fighting their way through four stages. It is one of the first martial arts games to include projectiles.<ref>{{cite web |author=Dargenio |first=Angelo |date=2014-01-14 |title=The History of Fighting Games: Part 1 |url=http://arcadesushi.com/the-history-of-fighting-games-part-1/ |website=Arcade Sushi}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

The player uses the joystick to move and perform various attacks<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=Winter 1983 |title=Arcade & Action Games |url=https://archive.org/details/Info-64_Issue_2_Winter_83-84_1983_Cybertech_US/page/n6/mode/1up |magazine=[[INFO=64]] |issue=2 |page=44 |via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> against ninjas and projectiles.  Each time the character is hit they will lose some of their health, but they will also lose some health for every kick or punch they perform.  The health can be restored by gaining enough points to earn a new promotion (Dan), or by making it to the next stage. There are four stages (temple, caverns, bridge and control room) the player can reach by earning enough points on the previous one.  Jumping through the door at the end of each stage will earn bonus points.

The final stage appears broken, but is in fact how the designer intended it to look.<ref name=":0" />
