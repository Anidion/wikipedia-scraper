==Reception==
"Compared to similar adventures, The Island is dull stuff with nothing out of the ordinary to recommend it.". ''[[Sinclair User]]''<ref>{{cite journal |date=March 1984 |title=Review... |journal=[[Sinclair User]] |issue=24 |pages=9}}</ref>

"It seems unlikely that any Spectrum owner will find it fun for more than a few minutes to play this repetitive, text-only adventure, which is filled with the programmer's inane humour". ''[[Sinclair Programs]]''<ref>{{cite journal |date=July 1984 |title=Review... |journal=[[Sinclair Programs]] |issue=8407 |pages=33}}</ref>
