{{nihongo|'''''Gyruss'''''|ジャイラス|Jairasu}} is [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade video game]] designed by [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] and released by [[Konami]] in 1983.<ref name="giantlist"/> ''Gyruss'' was initially licensed to [[Centuri]] in the [[United States]] for dedicated machines, before Konami released their own self-distributed conversion kits for the game. [[Parker Brothers]] released contemporary ports for home systems. An enhanced version for the [[Family Computer Disk System]] was released in 1988, which was released to the North American [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in early 1989.

The gameplay is similar to that of ''[[Galaga]]'' in a [[tube shooter]] format, with the player's ship facing into the screen and able to move around the perimeter of an implicit circle. Stars come into view at the centre of the screen and fly outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving through space.

''Gyruss'' is the second and last game [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] designed for [[Konami]], after ''[[Time Pilot]]''. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game, and he soon joined [[Capcom]], where he wrote ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'' and produced ''[[Street Fighter II]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Gyruss Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Commodore 64 version]]
The graphics are displayed using [[Perspective (graphical)#One-point perspective|one-point perspective]], with the vanishing point in the center of the screen. The player's ship is restricted to a circumference around the edge of the screen and may move in either direction along this path. All shots from the player converge at the vanishing point.

The majority of enemies are spaceships, which must be destroyed to complete a level. They appear either from the centre of the screen or from one of the edges, and move in swirling patterns. They can shoot the player's ship or destroy it by contact. They hover near the centre of the screen after completing their deployment pattern, and occasionally fly outwards and shoot at the player. If not destroyed by the player, the enemy ships gradually fly away one by one.

There are also several other types of enemies: [[satellite]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and [[laser]] beam generators. These appear intermittently and soon disappear of their own accord if not destroyed by the player.

Satellites materialise in a group of three just in front of the player after the ordinary enemy ships have finished deployment. They gyrate in small circles and shoot at the player. If the player has the basic weapon when the satellites appear the middle one will be a sun-like object. If destroyed, the player's ship gets a better weapon. If the better weapon has already been gained then all satellites are identical.

Asteroids fly straight outwards from the centre of the screen at regular intervals. They cannot be destroyed, but a small points bonus is given for shooting at them.

Laser beam generators occasionally fly straight outwards from the centre of the screen. They consist of two generator segments with a laser beam between them; destroying either generator deactivates the beam. The player's ship is destroyed by contact with either the generators or the beam.

The player begins the game "2 WARPS TO [[Neptune|NEPTUNE]]". After completing each level, the player is one warp closer to a planet. Each time a planet is reached, the player's ship is seen flying towards it and then a short [[bonus stage|bonus round]] is played, where the player can shoot enemy ships for bonus points without worrying about being destroyed by them. Each enemy destroyed in the bonus stage scores 100 or 10,000 for all 40. After reaching Neptune, the player is then three warps from [[Uranus]], and progresses through [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]], and finally [[Earth]], taking three warps to reach each planet, then repeats thereafter. At stage 1 and every 10th stage thereafter, the enemies do not fire on the player when entering the screen.

After completing Earth's bonus stage, the player must travel through the very fast "3 WARPS TO NEPTUNE" level before he/she can return to the start of the game.

Extra lives will be given at certain point thresholds, varying from one machine to another; but when the player's score is higher than 999,990 points, he/she can no longer obtain score-based extra lives.

==Music==
The game's background music is an electronic, uptempo arrangement of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s ''[[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565]]''; this particular track is similar to "Toccata", a [[rock and roll|rock]] arrangement by the UK-based instrumentalist group [[Sky (English/Australian band)|Sky]]. ''Gyruss'' uses [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] sound, which according to the bonus material for ''[[Konami 80's Arcade Gallery|Konami Arcade Classics]]'', was achieved by utilizing discrete audio circuits.

The audio system consists of five 3-voice [[General_Instrument_AY-3-8910|General Instrument AY-3-8910A]] sound chips.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gyruss |url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?page=detail&id=1063 |website=Arcade History}}</ref>

==Ports==
[[Parker Brothers]] released contemporary ports for the [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[ColecoVision]], and [[Commodore 64]]. A version for the [[ZX Spectrum]] was coded but never released.

''Gyruss'' was remade for the [[Family Computer Disk System]] in Japan, and later the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America, released by Konami's subsidiary [[Ultra Games]]. These versions include several major revisions:

# The player can use a super phaser attack in addition to the normal guns, which cost energy.
# There are additional enemies, including boss fights when the player reaches each planet.
# Bonus stages after each planet's boss is defeated, for a chance to gain additional powerups.
# There is a definite ending to the game. In the NES version, it's a brief text about the Universe being at peace. In the FDS version, there is a full ending sequence with credits.
# In addition to the satellites providing the usual double guns and bonus points, they can also provide extra phasers, a smart bomb, and even an extra life.
# Instead of the arcade's 24 stages, there are 39, including [[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and the [[Sun]].
# The player can enter the [[Konami code]] at the title screen for extra lives, but it must be entered in reverse (A-B-A-B-right-left-right-left-down-down-up-up).
