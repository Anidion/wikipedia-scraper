'''''Harrier Attack''''' (stylized as '''''Harrier Attack!''''') is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] released for the [[Oric 1]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1983 by [[Durell Software]]. Ports for the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Commodore 64]] were published in 1984.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]] fighter, looking sideways onto a right-to-left scrolling seascape and landscape. The aim of the game is to take off from a carrier, attack ships and land targets, avoid the occasional missile and enemy fighter, then land back on the carrier again. Although the game was a work of fiction, it was inspired by the 1982 [[Falklands War]], in which the Sea Harrier had played a major role.
