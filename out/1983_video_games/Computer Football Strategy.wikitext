'''''Computer Football Strategy''''' (also known as '''''Football Strategy'''''<ref name="gb64"/>) is a 1983 [[sports video game]] that simulates the [[National Football League]] from a strategic point of view. It was developed for the [[Commodore 64]]<ref name="gb64"/> and the [[Atari 8-bit computers]].<ref name="atarimania"/> Many retired professional football players have been noted to be content while recapturing their former heroics on this computer game.<ref name="elitomlinson">{{cite web | url = http://elitomlinson.com/index.php?title=Sports_Illustrated_Computer_Football_Strategy_(C64,_5_1/4%22_Disk)_Avalon_Hill_-_1983_USA,_Canada_Release| title = Advanced overview | publisher = Eli Tomlinson| access-date = 2011-03-26}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:FootballStrategyScreenshotC64.jpg|thumb]]
The basic choice of teams span from the [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|1966 Green Bay Packers]] (the winners of [[Super Bowl I]]) to the [[1982 Washington Redskins season|1982 Washington Redskins]] (the winners of [[Super Bowl XVII]] - the most recent [[Super Bowl]] as of the game's release). The game uses a top-down perspective in order to properly simulate the football field. The game shows the football field as a small, thin strip divided into ten-yard lines.<ref name="compute"/> Four basic graphics (the blue players playing the role as the defense and the black players playing the role as the offense) are considered to be "simulated American football players.<ref name="compute"/>" A notable criticism of the game is that having [[X]]'s and [[O]]'s would have been more realistic (because coaches use these in real-life football to write [[football playbook|playbook]]s for the team players).<ref name="compute"/>

Twenty different plays can be called from the [[line of scrimmage]] with ten different outcomes depending on the defensive alignment.<ref name="compute"/> The display shows a minimal coverage of the action; with no movement by either the [[quarterback]] or the [[wide receiver]]s.<ref name="compute"/> A complete lack of "hurry-up" offences means that each pass takes 15 seconds of game time to complete.<ref name="compute"/>

==Reception==
''Football Strategy'' was a runner up in the category of "Best Computer Sports Game" at the 4th annual [[Arkie Awards]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= March 1983 |title= Arcade Alley: The Best Computer Games |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 12|pages= 32â€“33|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|33}}
