'''''High Way Race''''' is a [[racing game]] released as an [[arcade video game]] by [[Taito]] in April 1983.<ref name="Moby">{{cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/high-way-race|title=High Way Race|work=MobyGames.com|publisher=Blue Flame Labs|accessdate=February 24, 2022}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The player is taking part in a cross country auto race. The player car will accelerate automatically, up to its maximum speed of {{convert|218|kph|mph}}, but it can be slowed by a brake button.<ref name="Moby"/> Other cars on the track will attempt to crash into the player car, but if they cannot be dodged, the player car has the ability to jump to avoid them.<ref name="Moby"/> The player has unlimited lives, but each collision—either with opponent cars or other obstacles—will deplete the car's fuel supply, and the game will end if the car runs out of fuel.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web|url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8113|title=High Way Race|work=arcade-museum.com|publisher=WebMagic Ventures, LLC|date=February 24, 2022}}</ref>

Around the race's halfway mark, a fuel truck appears with fueling arms to its left and right. The player car can refuel by contacting either of the arms, as long as it does not collide with the truck itself.<ref name="KLOV"/>

As the player reaches the end of the race course, signs on the track will count down to the finish line. The player vehicle must jump prior to the finish, otherwise it will crash into the water below, ending the game.<ref name="KLOV"/> A successful jump does not mean the race is completed, as the player must, upon landing, use the brakes to safely bring the car to a stop.<ref name="Moby"/> Points are awarded for remaining fuel at the end of the race, and the player will advance to the next race course.<ref name="Moby"/>
