'''''Knights of the Desert''''' is a 1983 [[computer wargame]] developed by Tactical Design Group and published by [[Strategic Simulations]] for the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[TRS-80]]. It is based on the 1940-43 [[North African campaign]].

Players have the option to play set pieces of the campaign or the entire campaign as a theatre commander. For example, players can play as either the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] or [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1941 when [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] bypassed [[Tobruk]] or again in 1942 when he had captured it or on the eve of [[El Alamein]].

Limited in scope and playability (the map only stretched from western Libya to Alexandria), the game did not involve the forces of [[Operation Torch]] (United States and allied French) in 1943.
