==Reception==
In a review for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', J. Robert Beck stated that adults would consider the game "engaging, if unsophisticated compared to the best prose adventures", adding, "Its shortcomings as an adventure program are well offset by its attention to anatomic detail and informative approach to a score of real medical problems." Beck criticized the "sketchy" documentation of the game.<ref name="CGW29">{{cite magazine |last=Beck |first=J.
