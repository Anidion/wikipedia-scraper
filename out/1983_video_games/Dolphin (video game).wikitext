'''''Dolphin''''' is a [[side-scrolling video game]] created by Matthew Hubbard for the [[Atari 2600]] and released by [[Activision]] in 1983. ''Dolphin'' requires the player to use audio cues in order to survive.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a dolphin attempting to flee from a giant squid. It must avoid colliding with packs of seahorses while navigating both forward- and backward-moving currents (indicated by arrows pointed with or against the dolphin's direction, respectively) which accelerate or decelerate its speed. Occasionally a seagull appears above the water's surface which, if touched, permits the player a short period of invincibility. During this time, the dolphin is able to touch the squid and drive it away.

The dolphin's sonar sounds to indicate how to avoid seahorses:  a high pitch indicates an opening near the water's surface, and a lower resonance indicates a seafloor passage.

==Development==
''Dolphin'' was designed by Matthew Hubbard. Hubbard started in the video game industry working for Atari in 1980 and joined Activision in 1982.<ref name="ActPack2" /> As a child, Hubbard was fascinated by animals, particularly whales and dolphins. He recalled that when he first started at Activision, he began animating a dolphin and asked staff if they could recognize what it was.<ref name="ActPack2">{{cite video game | title =Activision's Atari 2600 Action Pack 2 | developer =Activision | publisher = Activision | date=1995 | platform =Macintosh |level=Help > History > Matthew Hubbard on "Dolphin"}}</ref>

Hubbard wanted to use a dolphin's ability of [[Animal echolocation]] to give clues on where the player had to go next through audio clues. Hubbard also had the game feature much larger characters than the usual Atari 2600 game. This achieve this effect in game, Hubbard was assisted by [[Bob Whitehead]].<ref name="ActPack2" /> 

==Release==
''Dolphin'' was announced in January 1983 and was set to be shipped in April and be available in retail stores in May 1983.<ref name="news">{{cite magazine|magazine=Activision News Release|title=Activision Announces Dolphin|date=January 6, 1983}}</ref>

==Reception==
''[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]'' gave the game a positive review, stating that the graphics of the game were up to Activision's high standards noting the realistic dolphin swimming movements while finding the seagull unimpressive. The review concluded that ''Dolphin'' was "fascinating, although fans of heavy video action may find it a bit too cerebral. There is plenty of action - and suspense - in this game, but the aquatic setting gives it something of a languid feeling at the same time."{{sfn|The Video Game Update|1983|ref=VGU-ACom-Rev}} Dan Persons of ''Video Games'' magazine made similar statements, describing the game as "graphically stunning" and that "instead of creating another aquatic rehash of ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]'', Activision has created a chase game that cleverly incorporates sound as an active element of play."

''Dolphin'' won the "Best Videogame Audio/Visual Effects (Less than 16K ROM)" category in the ''[[Electronic Games]]'' 1984 Arcade Awards.{{sfn|Electronic Games|1984|ref=EG1984Awards}} From retrospective reviews, Brett Weiss in this book ''Classic Home Video Games 1972-1984'' (2007) found that fans of games like ''[[Seaquest (video game)|Seaquest]]'' might miss shooting action, but overall described the game as innovative and that most players will find it to be a satisfying experience.{{sfn|Weiss|2007|pp=53-54}}
