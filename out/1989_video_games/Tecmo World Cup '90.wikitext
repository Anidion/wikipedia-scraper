'''''Tecmo World Cup '90''''' is an [[List of association football video games|association football video game]] released by [[Tecmo]] as an [[arcade video game]] in 1989. It was a successor to Tecmo's ''[[Tehkan World Cup]]'' (1985) and is based on the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].

An unofficial bootleg of the game named '''''Euro League''''' featuring European club teams was also released. An unfaithful home version was developed by [[SIMS Co., Ltd.|SIMS]] for the [[Mega Drive]] renamed simply '''''Tecmo World Cup''''' (in Japan, the game was called ''Tecmo World Cup '92''), and ported to the [[Master System]] as ''[[Tecmo World Cup '93]]''.

==Gameplay==
The player can select one from eight available national teams in ''Tecmo World Cup '90''. Japan were included despite them failing to qualify for the World Cup in 1990. The game was an unofficial release, giving them the chance to include the team to appease Japanese players.

* {{fb|USA}}
* {{fb|England}}
* {{fb|Argentina}}
* {{fb|Brazil}}
* {{fb|West Germany}}
* {{fb|Soviet Union}}
