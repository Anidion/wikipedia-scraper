{{nihongo foot|'''''Holy Diver'''''|ホーリー・ダイヴァー|Hōrī Daivā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1989 Japanese [[video game]] for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Famicom]] home console developed and published by [[Irem]].

==Story==
It is the 666th year for the world of magic, and the Crimson Kingdom is facing destruction at the hands of the Black Slayer, Demon King of the Underground Dark Empire. Realizing that his days are numbered, the 16th Crimson Emperor, Ronnie IV, decides to entrust his two infant sons, Randy and Zakk, to his faithful servant, Ozzy. With Slayer's forces closing in, Ozzy, Randy and Zakk escape to another dimension, with the hope of eventually bringing light back into the world.

Over the following 17 years, Randy, Zakk, and Ozzy devote and train themselves to the cause of Magic Justice, becoming [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] [[king]]s. Meanwhile, Black Slayer has increased his empire over the countryside, making his interdimensional forces even stronger. In order to defeat Black Slayer and his army, Randy must retrieve the Five Crimson Emblem Seals. Making matters worse, Randy now must wage his war against Black Slayer alone, for Zakk suddenly goes missing and Ozzy passes away.

==Gameplay==
The game consists of six stages in total.<ref name=":5" /> After defeating the boss at the end of each level, the player can learn magic spells such as a spell that can freeze lava.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":0" />

It is similar to the game ''[[Getsu Fūma Den]]''. In fact, one of the stages has [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and graphics similar to those found in Konami's other game, ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]'' (the final boss is also very similar to ''Contra''{{'}}s). The [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] is like the one used in Nintendo's ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]''.

The player has an infinite supply of fireballs to attack enemies. These enemies include [[gargoyle]]s and flying eyeballs.<ref name=":2" />

In order to find and defeat Black Slayer, the player must travel through six stages, which primarily consist of [[forest]]s, castles, and caverns, all while seeking the Five Crimson Family Seals. The seals are powerful [[magic spell]]s, which are Twin Fire, Blizzard, Rock Breaker, Overdrive and Thunder. In addition to acquiring the seals, the player must also seek out the Bracelet, Jump Boots, Wizard's Staff, and the Cape of Protection, all of which assist physical strength and endurance.

== Development ==
Developed by Japanese video game company [[Irem]],<ref name=":8" /> the game is based on the 1983 album ''[[Holy Diver (song)|Holy Diver]]'' by the band [[Dio (band)|Dio]], but the game was not officially licensed from the band.<ref name=":2">{{Cite magazine|last=Rampton|first=Mike|date=July 23, 2016|title=Rock's Greatest Video Games|magazine=Kerrang!|page=23}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/13-times-video-games-went-metal/|title=13 Times Video Games Went Metal|website=Kerrang!|date=22 October 2018 |access-date=2019-01-05|archive-date=2019-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627141352/https://www.kerrang.com/features/13-times-video-games-went-metal/|url-status=live}}</ref> The game has four main characters, named after musicians [[Ronnie James Dio]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Zakk Wylde]], and [[Randy Rhoads]].<ref name=":2" /> Other characters and locations in the game are references to rock music such as the [[King Crimson|Crimson Kingdom]] and [[Slayer|Black Slayer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/classic-rock-video-games/|title=Rock Stars in Video Games: The Complete History|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|date=15 December 2018 |language=en|access-date=2019-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216125926/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/classic-rock-video-games/|archive-date=2018-12-16|url-status=live}}</ref>
