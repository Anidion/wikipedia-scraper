'''''Stunt Car Racer''''' (published as '''''Stunt Track Racer''''' in the [[United States]]) is a [[racing video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Geoff Crammond]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=July 2013 |title=The making of... Stunt Car Racer |url=https://archive.org/details/edgeuk125 |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/edgeuk125/page/n93 114]–117 |access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> It was [[video game publisher|published]] in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] by [[MicroProse]], under their MicroStyle and MicroPlay labels in the [[United Kingdom]] and in the United States, respectively. The game pits two racers on an elevated track on which they race in a head-to-head competition, with ramps they must correctly drive off as the main obstacle.

The game was released to critical acclaim. The Commodore 64 version's use of 3D [[vector graphics]] was met with critical enthusiasm, which was unusual for a game for that platform. It is considered one of the better racing games and games for Amiga, with many calling it one of the best such games.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ST Stunt Car Racer.png|thumb|left|250px|Atari ST screenshot of the gameplay. (The Amiga version is graphically identical.)]]

The game differs from other racing games in that the races take place on an elevated [[race track]], with nothing to stop the player from accidentally driving off the side. Most race tracks in the game have gaps in them, which players can fall into. If this occurs then the player's vehicle is hoisted back onto the track (by a nearby [[crane (machine)|crane]]), costing valuable time. [[Turbo]] can be used to make a car go faster, but it can only be used for a limited amount of time in each race.<ref name="amstrad_arcade" /><ref name="your_sinclair" /><ref name="crash" />

The single-player game consists of a [[league table]] which is split into four divisions of three drivers each, making a total of twelve racers including the human player. There are two racing tracks in each division making it a total of eight tracks in the game. The tracks in division four (the first division) are easy, but the tracks get progressively more difficult and dangerous with each division. The player's objective is to reach, and subsequently win, division one. There are four races in a season, and each driver will race the other two drivers in both of the tracks in the division. Each race is run over three laps. Two points are awarded to the winner of each race and one point is awarded to the racer with the fastest lap time. At the end of each [[season (sport)|season]], the top racer of each division is promoted to the next higher division while the driver in last place will be relegated.<ref name="amstrad_arcade" /><ref name="your_sinclair" /><ref name="crash" />

Damage to the player's car occurs when the player lands too hard on the track after driving over a crest too fast, crashes into a wall, falls into a gap in the track, or hits the opponent's car. If the damage, which is indicated by a crack in the frame at the top of the screen, reaches a certain level, the vehicle is deemed to be wrecked and the driver loses the race instantly. A particularly hard crash will also make holes representing structural damage appear in the frame above the [[windshield]]. Holes remain on the car for the rest of the season and increase the rate at which the crack in the frame advances.<ref name="amstrad_arcade" /><ref name="crash" /><ref name="your_sinclair" />

The player can compete against computer opponents or, at least on the Atari ST and Amiga versions, with another player using two computers connected via a [[null modem cable]], each with their own TV or monitor. Such direct head-to-head racing between players is also made possible by [[cross-platform play|pairing]] an Amiga computer with an Atari ST computer via the cable.<ref name=RetroGamer/>

==Development and release==
British developer Geoff Crammond spent three years developing ''Stunt Car Racer'', his second car-based title after ''[[Revs (video game)|Revs]]'' in 1984. The project started off as a land-roving simulator for Commodore 64 where one drives on randomly undulating terrain. The physics were then programmed for the car's suspension, and after testing the game himself, Crammond found driving off ramps the most enjoyable. He then added in more ramps on an even stretch of the landscape, but had difficulty locating them. He therefore placed the ramps on a track, which he then elevated to avoid driving onto the field. The track's corners were banked to emphasize the game's speed and the ramps as its main challenge. It was suggested after a magazine interview with Crammond that he was inspired by the arcade game ''[[Hard Drivin']]'', but he said that he had seen it only in the final months of his game's development and that it had no impact on its outcome.<ref name=RetroGamer>{{cite magazine|title=In the chair with Geoff Crammond|last=McFerran|first=Damien|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=6 October 2009|issue=69|pages=83–86}}</ref><ref name=GamesTM>{{cite book|chapter=Retro Interview: Geoff Crammond|title=Retro|publisher=[[GamesTM]]|date=2006|volume=2|pages=114–116|isbn=0-9553032-3-0}}</ref>

Visually, the difference between the early 8-bit and later Amiga and Atari ST releases{{Citation needed|reason=ACE magazine issue 27 of December 1989 suggests on p100 that 16-bit versions came first, with other contemporary magazines listing the Amiga as the lead platform|date=February 2023}} is that the latter use a system for plotting polygons instead of a solid fill technique. Another key difference is that besides racing head-to-head on two linked computers, an Amiga can be connected to an Atari ST computer via the same [[RS-232]] serial port on both machines for cross-platform play, owing to Crammond's experience with outputting data for his other game, ''[[Aviator (video game)|Aviator]]'', on the [[BBC Micro]].<ref name=RetroGamer/> MicroProse considered adding up to eight concurrent racers and an editor for creating tracks, but ruled in favor of head-to-head racing and against the latter because doing either would have caused the gameplay to suffer severe stutters.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Ace_Magazine_Issue_33a/page/13|title=Games Lack Atmosphere?|department=Prize Letter|magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]|date=June 1990|access-date=16 August 2022|issue=33|page=13}}</ref> The ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC ports of ''Stunt Car Racer'' were programmed by [[Pete Cooke]], and the [[DOS]] version was programmed by Tim Ansell.<ref name=GamesTM/> The Commodore 64 version was later modified for use without a keyboard. This version was in the Power Play cartridge together with ''[[Rick Dangerous]]'' and ''[[MicroProse Soccer]]'', released for the [[Commodore 64 Games System|C64 Games System]]. The last platforms to be ported to were the Amiga and the Atari ST, both programmed by Crammond.<ref name=GamesTM/> A port of ''Stunt Car Racer'' for the [[Atari Jaguar]] was rumored to be in development, but it was never released.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=February 1994 |title=Europa! |url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_03#page/n122/mode/1up |url-status=live |magazine=[[GameFan]] |publisher=Shinno Media |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=123 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104222106/https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_03#page/n122/mode/1up |archive-date=4 January 2019 |access-date=4 January 2019}}</ref><ref name="ToadCompuCatalog1994">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/ToadComputersCatalog1994/page/n6/mode/1up|title=Jaguar Games and Accessories: New Jaguar Titles! — Many Others Are Coming soon!|magazine=Toad Computers Product Catalog|type=catalog|publisher=Toad Computers|date=1994|page=5}}</ref>

A long-awaited sequel, ''Stunt Car Racer Pro'', was announced in April 2003, but it never came to fruition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/driving/stuntcarracerpro/news.html?sid=6024666 |title=Stunt Car Racer Pro announced |last=Calvert |first=Justin |date=7 April 2003 |website=[[GameSpot]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930100926/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/driving/stuntcarracerpro/news.html?sid=6024666 |archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref>

The Commodore 64, Amstrad, Amiga, and Atari ST versions of the game received critical acclaim.<ref name=CVG-Amstrad/><ref name=TGM-C64/> ''[[Zzap!64]]'' was particularly enthusiastic about the Commodore 64 version. In its review, it lauded the game's concept and the quality of its 3D vector graphics. One of its reviewers, though preferring to race against more than a single opponent directly, called it the most remarkable Commodore 64 program.<ref name=Z64/> ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' magazine, who was equally enthusiastic, also extolled the version's vector graphics and the speed at which they are loaded as unparalleled in Commodore 64 gaming.<ref name=ACE-C64/> ''[[Commodore Computing International]]'' also praised the use of vector graphics on a brand of computer not well recognised for its library of decent 3D games, as well as the controls and the difficulty, and described the game as a hybrid of ''Hard Drivin''{{'}} and ''[[Power Drift]]'', with a few ideas of its own.<ref name=CCI/> ''[[Amstrad Action]]'' defined it as a "truly stunning racing sim" and one of the best ever on [[Amstrad CPC]].<ref name="amstrad_arcade" /> ''[[The Games Machine]]'' felt the color selection used for the Amstrad port was gaudy and that with the tracks being of the same colour as the ground and their banked corners lacking shading, distinguishing the road from the ground could be troublesome, but praised its addictive, "hair-raising" gameplay.<ref name=TGM-Amstrad/>

In comparison, reviews for the Spectrum and DOS ports were generally favorable. ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' praised the graphics and the entertainment, but criticised the limiting number of tracks.<ref name="crash" /> On the DOS side, ''Zero'' lamented the port's lack of track detail and limited color palette, but otherwise found that it still had the pace and gameplay that was as exhilarating as the Amiga and ST versions.<ref name=Zero-PC/> ''[[Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]'' praised the animation, but thought that the landscape was bland.<ref name=JS-DOS/>

Editors of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' voted ''Stunt Car Racer'' as the 1989 game of the year.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Your_Sinclair_053/page/49|title=''YS'' Games of the Year '89|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|date=May 1990|access-date=16 August 2022|issue=53|pages=49–51}}</ref> ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' listed it as one of the five greatest racing games of all time<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Ace_Magazine_Issue_41a/page/65|title=The ACE guide to the greatest games of all-time – Part 1|magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]|date=February 1991|access-date=16 August 2022|issue=41|page=65}}</ref> and ''[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]]'' the 45th best racing game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/gaming/these-are-the-top-50-best-ever-driving-games-50-41|title=The top 50 best ever driving games: 50-41|work=[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]]|date=28 March 2017|access-date=16 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220816062508/https://www.topgear.com/car-news/gaming/these-are-the-top-50-best-ever-driving-games-50-41|archive-date=16 August 2022|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Amiga Power]]'', ''[[CU Amiga]]'', and ''Your Sinclair'' ranked it respectively the 10th, the 11th, and the 85th best game of all time for the platforms they covered,<ref name="amiga_power">{{Cite magazine |date=May 1991 |title=All-time top 100 games |url=https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Power_Issue_00_1991-05_Future_Publishing_GB |url-status=live |magazine=[[Amiga Power]] |page=6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315024435/https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Power_Issue_00_1991-05_Future_Publishing_GB |archive-date=15 March 2017 |access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/cuamiga-magazine-086/page/n24|title=The Best 50 Amiga Games Ever|magazine=[[CU Amiga]]|date=April 1997|access-date=16 August 2022|issue=86|page=25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html |title=The official game top 100 of all time |website=World of Spectrum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030232331/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html |archive-date=30 October 2015 |access-date=24 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> and ''[[Amiga Format]]'' likewise named it one of the 15 best Amiga games.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/AmigaFormatMagazine_201902/Amiga_Format_Issue_019_1991_02_Future_Publishing_GB/page/n109|title=The 15 Best Games of All Time|magazine=[[Amiga Format]]|date=February 1991|access-date=16 August 2022|issue=19|page=110}}</ref> Several publications consider it to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' listed it as the 54th best game in 2000,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Edge_Gaming/Edge%20Gaming%20Magazine%20080/page/n46|title=The 100 best games of all time|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|date=January 2000|access-date=16 August 2022|issue=80|page=60}}</ref> ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' the 77th in 2008,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=100 Greatest Games|magazine=[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]|date=October 2008|pages=116–126}}</ref> and ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' the 355th in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/28/16689522/polygon-500-best-games-of-all-time-400-301|title=The 500 best games of all time: 400-301|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=28 November 2017|access-date=16 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220815221819/https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/28/16689522/polygon-500-best-games-of-all-time-400-301|archive-date=15 August 2022|url-status=live}}</ref>
