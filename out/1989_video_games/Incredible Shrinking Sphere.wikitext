On the planet Sangfalmadore, the player is recruited to the Sphere Training Corps. An earthquake has trapped the STC's Colonel Matt Ridley, leaving it up to the player to rescue him.

==Gameplay==
The game consists of eight levels, each divided into four maze sections. The player must direct the ball to the exit of the maze. Each maze has traps and assassin enemies. Assassins can be countered with collectable shields or ammo. Traps can be tackled by shrinking or enlarging the ball.
