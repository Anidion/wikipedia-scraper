'''''Ricochet''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] for the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] home computers, published by [[Superior Software]] in 1989. It was written by Neil Davidson and David Williams with some graphics work and level design by Nik Weston and [[Guy Burt]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ricochet (1989) |url=https://videogamegeek.com/videogame/143867/ricochet-1989 |access-date=2024-03-14 |website=VideoGameGeek |language=en-US}}</ref>

The object of the game is to retrieve five [[hourglass]]es from diverse scenarios to restore the flow of time. It features elements of both [[Platform game|platform]] and [[Puzzle game|puzzle]] games. The puzzles are mostly [[logic]]al (keys unlock doors, gold placates a burglar), though there are exceptions.

While the game shares many elements made popular in earlier Superior arcade adventures such as ''[[Citadel (video game)|Citadel]]'', it has a unique feel due to the movement of the main character. The player controls a creature named "SPRAT" (Small Partially Robotic Alien Time-traveller), depicted as a red sphere wearing sunglasses. SPRAT moves by rolling but can only do so along level ground or down slopes. There are ladders to climb but many platforms require a special movement to be reached. By holding 'down' (SPRAT squashes himself) to build up potential energy, then releasing, SPRAT can bounce at either a 45- or 90-degree angle.

==Legacy==
''Ricochet'' is one of a range of 1980s Superior games that was re-released for [[Microsoft Windows]] by [[Superior Software|Superior Interactive]], with new graphics and added levels.
