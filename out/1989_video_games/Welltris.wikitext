'''''Welltris''''' is a [[puzzle video game]], developed by [[Doca (video game developer)|Doca]] and licensed to [[Bullet-Proof Software]]. It is an official game in the ''[[Tetris]]'' series. Adaptations were made by Sphere, Inc., for [[Spectrum HoloByte]], and by [[Infogrames]]. It was released for [[MS-DOS]] compatible operating systems in 1989. Ports for [[Macintosh]], [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Atari ST]] followed 1990, then [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]] 1991.

==Gameplay==
''Welltris'' was the first ''[[Tetris]]'' sequel designed by original designer [[Alexey Pajitnov]], with Andrei Sgenov. It retains that game's falling-block puzzle gameplay but extends the pit into three dimensions while the blocks remain two-dimensional, with the board viewed from above.

As blocks descend into the well, they can be rotated or moved left or right along the walls, from one wall to another if desired. Once a block reaches the floor, it will slide as far as possible until stopped by an edge or another piece. Whenever the player completes a solid horizontal or vertical line, it disappears and the remaining squares slide to fill the open space.<ref name=st_action>{{cite journal|first=Nick|last=Clarkson|journal=[[ST Action]]|issue=34|date=February 1991|title=Welltris|url=http://www.atarimania.com/mags/pdf/atari_st_action_34.pdf|page=90}}</ref>

If a falling block comes to rest with any part of itself still on a wall, that wall is temporarily frozen; no blocks can be moved onto it during this time. Freezing all four walls ends the game.<ref name=st_action />

==Reception==
<!--DOS, Mac, Amiga and Atari ST review scores to go here (being the earlier releases)-->In 1990, ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave the [[Macintosh IIx]] version of the game 5 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon159">{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk |journal=Dragon |issue=159 |date=July 1990 |pages=47–53}}</ref> ''[[MacUser]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''Welltris'', praising the new playstyle as compared to its predecessor, and stating that "''Welltris'' is both thoughtful and highly addictive."<ref>{{cite magazine|last = Breen|first = Christopher|title = Welltris Review|date = October 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/MacUser9010October1990/page/n81|magazine = MacUser|publisher = Dennis Publishing Ltd.|pages = 80–81}}</ref> ''[[Macworld]]'' also reviewed the Mac version, praising its gameplay, music and graphics, summarizing their thoughts by stating "[''Welltris''] successfully extends the ''Tetris'' metaphor; cheery folk music and captivating scenes; very challenging." ''Macworld'' criticizes the steep learning curve and a point in the game where the speed of the falling pieces become unmanagable, referring to the latter as the "one annoying habit" that it shares with ''Tetris''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last = O'Meara|first = Felicity|title = Game Hall of Fame|date = September 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_9009_September_1990/page/n269|magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|page = 263}}</ref>

The ZX Spectrum version had mixed reviews, with ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' awarding 79%,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=CRASH |issue=87 |date=April 1991 |title=Welltris |page=40 |url=https://archive.org/details/crash-magazine-87}}</ref> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' awarding 45%<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Sinclair User |issue=110 |title=Welltris |page=28 |date=April 1991 |url=https://archive.org/details/sinclair-user-magazine-110}}</ref> and ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' giving 79%.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Your Sinclair |issue=64 |date=April 1991 |title=Welltris |page=64 |url=https://archive.org/details/your-sinclair-64}}</ref> The actual gameplay and addictiveness were highlighted as good areas, but criticisms included the fiddly controls and minimal sound and looks.

The Commodore 64 version, with its more colourful graphics, received 80% from ''[[Zzap!64]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=071&page=017&magazine=zzap|title=Zzap!Test!|journal=Zzap!64|issue=71|date=March 1991}} at the Def Guide to Zzap!64</ref>
