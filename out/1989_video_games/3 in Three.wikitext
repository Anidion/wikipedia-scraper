}}'''''3 in Three''''' is a 1989 [[metapuzzle]] [[video game]] designed by [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]] and published by [[Cinemaware]] and Inline Design.

While bearing some similarities to his previous game, ''[[The Fool's Errand]]'', ''3 in Three'' took place inside a [[computer]].  The game is about a [[number]] [[3 (number)|3]], lost in the innards of the computer by a [[Voltage spike|power surge]].  The 3 attempts to repair the damage caused by the power surge and make her way back to the [[spreadsheet]], providing the background story for the game.

== Gameplay==
The game consists of many separate sections, each of which contains one puzzle.  However, unlike Fool's Errand, each section may need to be visited multiple times, as it may carry along part of the story at times when it does not contain a puzzle.  Each puzzle (upon completion) places one [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] in the Letter [[Legislature]].  When the entire legislature is in place, a logic puzzle (see below) is used to properly order them, at which point the endgame begins; the hints found in previous puzzles are used to complete the [[meta-puzzle]] and finish the game.

Unlike ''The Fool's Errand'', the puzzles in 3 in Three are rarely traditional puzzles like [[cryptogram]]s or [[word search]]es; instead, the puzzles tend to take advantage of the possibilities of computer games.<ref name="moss" />  Some of the prominent puzzle types include:

* Lift puzzles - the 3 must navigate across a field of lifts by putting her lift and the lift to her right at the same level.
* Mesh puzzles - the 3 must change a mesh (of sizes ranging from 3x3 to 9x9) to match a given pattern.
* Missing vowels - the 3 must add missing [[vowel]]s to common [[proverb]]s or [[homophone]]s.
* Trapdoor puzzles - the 3 must open or close all of a set of doors; clicking on one door will toggle the open state of several others, with the exact set of doors, toggled depending on the state of the door clicked.  (Thus clicking on door 3 may open or close doors 1, 3, and 9 if it is open, but 3, 4, and 5 if it is closed.)
* Reordered word puzzles - the 3 must rearrange a word to spell another word in 3 clicks.  Each click switches two letters; the letters switched depend on which letter is clicked and its position in the word.
* Logic puzzles - A grid of items must be rearranged to meet specific rules.  (For example, a set of [[Roman numerals]] may include a rule like 'XVI is north of XIV'.)

== Release ==
Unlike the developer's earlier games, ''3 in Three'' was never ported but was released only for the [[Macintosh]].  It was initially released by [[Cinemaware]], which went out of business in 1991; the license was then picked up by Inline Design, which went out of business in 1995.<ref name="moss" /> It is now [[freeware]] and can be found on the author's website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefoolserrand.com/07-DL/index.htm|title=Downloads|publisher= [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]] |website=thefoolserrand.com}}</ref> It includes information which allows the game to be played on Windows PCs.

==Reception==
''3 in Three'' was reviewed positively in ''[[Macworld]]'', which described it as "an ultramodern ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''" with an "obsessively good set" of puzzles. ''Macworld'' noted occasional issues with puzzles that were too easy or frustrating, but overall praised the game as mostly "creative, fun, entertaining, and best of all, challenging."<ref>{{cite journal
