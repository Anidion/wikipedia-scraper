M. Evan Brooks reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Sadly, ''Tank'' has no infantry; both sides are armor heavy. This could well occur in rare instances, but the absence of infantry is sorely missed in what purports to be a simulation of the contemporary battlefield."<ref name="CGW68">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M.

Paul Rigby for ''[[The Games Machine]]'' said that "''Tank'' is an enjoyable simulation which benefits from a great deal of detailed research – the operation of the [[M1 Abrams]] is well portrayed, while the option of being able to control 16 tanks is exciting (and exhausting!)."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/NH2021_TheGamesMachine_Issue31.pdf/mode/2up | title=NH2021_TheGamesMachine_Issue31.PDF }}</ref>

Steven Anzovin for ''[[Compute!]]'' said that "If you sigh wistfully for the great tank battles that may never be, ''Tank'' is definitely your game."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1990-03-compute-magazine/page/n153/mode/2up|title = Compute!
