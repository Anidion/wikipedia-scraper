''Antic's Amiga Plus'' gave the Amiga version of ''Planet of Lust'' an overall score of 2 out of five stars, criticizing the game's graphics as "[looking] like they were imported from an [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] machine" as well as the 'underwhelming' amount of sexual content, expressing that "while there is supposed to be an erotic feeling to the game it is nothing to get excited about. The graphics of naked women and softcore nature might titillate only the sexually desperate". ''Amiga Plus'' expressed that they were underwhelmed by ''Planet of Lust's'' 'almost interesting' gameplay, stating that it might have at best "a few interesting puzzles and a chuckle or two."<ref name=antics>{{cite magazine|title = Quick Shots: Planet of Lust Amiga Review|date = February 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/Antics_AMIGA_Plus_Volume_1_Number_6_1990-02_Antic_Publishing_US/page/n89/mode/2up|magazine = Antic's Amiga Plus|publisher = Antic Publishing|first = Guy|last = Wright|page = 91|volume = 1|issue = 6}}</ref>

German gaming magazine ''Amiga Joker'' gave the Amiga version of ''Planet of Lust'' an overall score of 31%, beginning their review by expressing that "It's hard to believe, but ''Planet of Lust'' manages to undercut [[Sex Vixens from Space|its predecessor]]: the confusingly similar packaging once more contains two disks, and the quality of the graphics is certainly inconsistent - and they're good for almost nothing!" ''Amiga Joker'' compared ''Planet of Lust's'' controls to that of adventure games by [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]], but criticized the game's parser, music, and 'monotonous' gameplay, stating that "[the] parser understands maybe ten words. You go from room to room, you try not to let the music put you to sleep, and other than that you wait for a naked woman to eventually appear onscreen." ''Amiga Joker'' criticized ''Planet of Lust's'' 'underwhelming' sexual content, expressing that "If you manage to get that far, you'll be disappointed: a glimpse of the actual [[Playboy]] title screen is the only excitement you'll get. The game promises sexual intrigue, but then it offers nothing - it's one to forget!"<ref name=joker>{{cite magazine|title = Planet of Lust Amiga Review|date = January 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Joker_1990-01_Joker_Verlag_DE/page/n23/mode/2up|magazine = Amiga Joker|publisher = Joker Verlag|first = Werner|last = Hiersekorn|page = 24}}</ref>

''[[.info (magazine)|.info]]'' gave the Amiga version of ''Planet of Lust'' an overall score of 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it an improvement over its predecessor ''Sex Vixens from Space'', and praised the game's "colorful cartoonesque" graphics and "smutty" & "humorous" text.
