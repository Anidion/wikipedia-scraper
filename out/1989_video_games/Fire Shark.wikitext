'''''Fire Shark'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''Same! Same! Same!'''''|{{ruby|鮫! 鮫! 鮫!|サメ! サメ! サメ!}}|| ''"Shark! Shark! Shark!"''|lead=yes}} in Japan.}} is a 1989 [[vertically scrolling shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Toaplan]] in Japan and Europe, and by [[Romstar]] in North America. It is the sequel to ''[[Flying Shark]]'', a game released in 1987 on multiple platforms. Set in the year 1991, the game focuses on a mysterious armada launching a worldwide attack from a small island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Players take control of the titular [[biplane]] to counterattack the enemy forces.

Though first launched for the arcades, ''Fire Shark'' was [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] in-house to the [[Mega Drive/Genesis]] and published worldwide by DreamWorks, Toaplan and [[Sega]] between 1990 and 1991. The console launch featured various changes compared with the original release. A [[Video game conversion|conversion]] for the [[Sharp X68000]] was developed but never released. The game was well received in arcades across Western regions where reviewers commended its graphics, sound and gameplay, but it proved to be less popular in Japan due to the high difficulty level. The Mega Drive/Genesis version was also met with mostly positive reviews from critics across multiple regions.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Fire Shark (Same! Same! Same!).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]
''Fire Shark'' is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game reminiscent of ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'', where players take control of the titular biplane through ten increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of enemy forces like [[tank]]s, [[battleship]]s, [[kamikaze]] [[monoplanes]] and [[artillery]] from the mysterious Strange Fleet armada. This is the main objective of the game.<ref name="MBASICM91">{{cite magazine|last=Satomi|first=Yasuyuki|url=https://archive.org/stream/micomBASIC_1990-01#page/n243/mode/2up|title=Super Soft Corner - Video Game: 鮫! 鮫! 鮫!|magazine=[[:ja:マイコンBASICマガジン|Micom BASIC Magazine]]|issue=91|publisher=[[:ja:電波新聞社|The Dempa Shimbunsha Corporation]]|date=January 1990|pages=288–290|lang=ja}}</ref><ref name="FSGENmanual">''Fire Shark'' instruction manual (Sega Genesis, US)</ref><ref name="FShg101">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/fire-shark/|title=Fire Shark|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=1 February 2011|access-date=2019-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521075844/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/fire-shark/|archive-date=21 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="FSss">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/same3.html|title=鮫！鮫！|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2019-11-30|language=ja|archive-date=17 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017222150/http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/same3.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The game plays similarly like its predecessor, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until an airport is reached. Players have two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of half the screen's height and bombs capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius.<ref name="MBASICM91"/><ref name="FSss"/>

There are three types of weapons to pick up that appear as colored icons by destroying zeppelins: a wide shot, a laser beam and a flamethrower.<ref name="MBASICM91"/><ref name="FSGENmanual"/><ref name="FSss"/> There are also other [[Item (gaming)|item]]s like "S" icons that increases the overall speed, "B" icons that acts as extra bomb stocks, "P" icons and [[1UP]]s on rare occasions.<ref name="MBASICM91"/><ref name="FSGENmanual"/><ref name="FSss"/> By acquiring three "P" icons in a row, players increase their plane's firepower to one level, with the third power level being the highest.<ref name="MBASICM91"/><ref name="FSGENmanual"/><ref name="FSss"/> Once the plane is fully powered up, grabbing additional icons grants extra points instead. Reaching high-scores is also crucial to obtain extra lives, which are obtained at certain score values.<ref name="FSGENmanual"/> Players can grab lightning-shaped medals for points by destroying containers on the playfield.<ref name="FSGENmanual"/><ref name="MBASICM91"/>

Depending on the settings in the arcade version, the title uses either a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying, or a [[respawn]] system where their ship immediately starts at the location they died at.<ref name="FShg101"/> Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's firepower and speed to his original state and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to [[Glossary of video game terms#Continue|continue]] playing. Once all ten stages are complete, the game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous titles from Toaplan, with each one increasing the difficulty and enemies fire denser bullet patterns.

== Plot ==
The plot summary of ''Fire Shark'' varies between each region and version.<ref name="FSACjp">''Fire Shark'' arcade flyer (Toaplan, JP)</ref><ref name="FSACeu">''Fire Shark'' arcade flyer (Toaplan, EU)</ref> In the original arcade version, a mysterious enemy fleet known as the Strange Fleet arrived at a small island of the Mediterranean Sea during summer night in 1991, with few people noticing its sudden arrival. In the span of two years, the Strange Fleet grew larger and larger, culminating in a worldwide attack as a result. As the Strange Fleet continues their assault, those who oppose them cried "Fire Shark! Fire Shark! It's time to take-off!! Beat them for our sake. Go! Go! Fire Shark!".<ref name="FSACjp"/><ref name="FSACeu"/> In the Sega Genesis port, the game takes place in the year 19X9 on an alternate Earth instead, where a global superpower known as the S Corps, which specializes in a heavy industrial army begins invading various countries, with all seemingly lost when a phantom pilot flying a super-powered biplane called the Fire Shark flies in to save the world from domination.<ref name="FSGENmanual"/>

''Fire Shark''{{'}}s development process and history was recounted between 1989 and 2012 through Japanese publications such as ''Shooting Gameside'' by former Toaplan [[Video game composer|composer]] Masahiro Yuge. Yuge acted as the game's composer, with Shintarō Nakaoka serving as [[Video game artist|artist]], while both Sanae Nitō and Yuko Tataka were also involved in the production as [[Video game designer|designer]]s, though none of the members in the development team were credited as such in neither version of the game.<ref name="PSGv10">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=東亜プランインタビュー|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=F.S.G Club|date=September 1989|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name="VGMDB">{{cite web|url=https://vgmdb.net/album/596|title=PCCB-00007 &#124; Same!

The team wanted to convey "the same strengths" as its predecessor, ''Flying Shark'', by adding elements like the flamethrower as a way to promote the game, with Yuge stating that the weapon acted as a successor to the blue laser in 1989's ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]''.<ref name="TSCb"/><ref name="STGv4b">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Yūsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=東亜プラン特集 - 元・東亜プラン 開発者インタビュー: 弓削雅稔|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=41–48|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023744/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref> However, Yuge later stated regrets in recent years for not balancing the game's difficulty for both arcade owners and players.<ref name="STGv4b"/> The development team settled on using the word "same" when coming up for the project's title, which translates to "shark" in Japanese to convey a strong animal sound.<ref name="TSCa">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=14 November 2011|access-date=2019-11-30|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030143/https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711134859/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/|date=2018-07-11}}).</ref> Nakaoka was also responsible for drawing the crowd during the takeoff sequence at the beginning of the game that was, according to Yuge, later animated during their leisure for diversion.<ref name="TSCb"/><ref name="STGv4b"/>
