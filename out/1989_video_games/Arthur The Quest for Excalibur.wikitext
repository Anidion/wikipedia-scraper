'''''Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur''''' is an illustrated [[interactive fiction]] [[video game]] written by [[Bob Bates]] and published by [[Infocom]] in 1989. It was released for the [[Apple II]], [[Amiga]], [[Macintosh]], and [[IBM PC compatible]]s. Atypically for an Infocom product, it shows illustrations of locations, characters and objects within the game. It is Infocom's thirty-fourth game and is the second of two Infocom games developed by Challenge using Infocom's development tools.<ref name="developer"/>

==Plot==
[[File:Arthur_The_Quest_for_Excalibur_Gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An example of gameplay in the Amiga version. The player has inputted the letter "s" for "south", indicating that they intend to move into the southward tavern described in the text.]]
The player assumes the role of a young [[King Arthur|Arthur]], before the legendary days of [[Camelot]]. The "sword in the stone" (which in the legends was not [[Excalibur]], but is often confused with Excalibur by people unfamiliar with the legends) that would signify Arthur's destiny to rule, has been stolen by the evil [[Lot (Arthurian legend)|King Lot]]. In the quest to regain the sword, the player must prove to [[Merlin]] that he has the qualities needed to be a great king: [[chivalry]], experience, and [[wisdom]]. Merlin assists Arthur by giving him periodic advice as well as the power to transform into animals, but also tells Arthur that unless Excalibur is recovered within three days, Lot will usurp his destiny as a king of legendary stature.

==Feelies==
Although ''Arthur'' was one of the last interactive fiction games Infocom released before closing, the packaging still included a modest attempt at the extra objects, or [[feelies]], that had been a long-standing tradition for the company. The package for ''Arthur'' contained a copy of a ''Book of Hours'', which explains the [[Canonical hours]] such as [[Matins]], [[Lauds]] and [[Vespers]]. The book also contains a poem, lines of which are used as passwords in the game as a form of [[copy protection]].

==Production==
''Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur'' was the second Infocom game to be developed by another company, Challenge Inc, published by Infocom in their "Immortal Legends" genre.<ref name="developer"/> The only other game published in this line was the 1987 release ''[[Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown Jewels]]'', also written by Bates. By the time of ''Arthur'''s release, Infocom had stopped rating their games in terms of difficulty. Arthur roughly corresponds to the level of their previous "Standard" games.

==Reception==
The Amiga version of ''Arthur'' was met with critical acclaim. ''Zzap!'' praised the game's puzzles, graphics, vocabulary and parser, and noted the "odd touch of humour".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-054/page/n29 |title=''Arthur'' |publisher=Zzap! |date=October 1989 |access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref> Paul Rigby of ''The Games Machine'' also commended the parser and text, and stated that the ability to transform into animals aided the inventiveness of the puzzles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amr.abime.net/review_5095 |title=''Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur'' |author=Paul Rigby |date=October 1989 |publisher=The Games Machine |page=72 |access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref> Keith Campbell of ''Computer & Video Games'' personally ranked the game as among the best from Infocom, and cited the added intrigue lent to the game's puzzles by the transformation feature.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-095/CVG_095_Oct_1989#page/n96/mode/1up |title=''Arthur'' |author=Keith Campbell |date=October 1989 |publisher=Computer & Video Games |page=97 |access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref> Nick Walkland of ''Amiga Format'' was impressed by the game's graphics and felt that they made the game "atmospherically supreme".

[[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' deemed the Apple II version "Infocom's most poorly produced game ever", criticizing the high number of disk swaps (sometimes to print a single sentence or to redraw the [[automap]]) and the "mediocre" Apple II graphics.{{r|scorpia198909}}
