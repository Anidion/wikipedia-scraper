According to the game's instruction manual, the player controls a [[boomerang]]-wielding hero whose mission is to destroy the [[robot]]ic [[demon]] army of the evil king Kull.<ref name="mobygames"/> There are seven levels in Robodemons, which are titled the "levels of" Bone, Flesh, Fire, Condemned Souls, Demon's Quarters, Robodemon Factory and Kull's Palace.<ref name="mobygames"/>

Unlike most Color Dreams games which featured heavy religious/Christian themes, Robodemons contains very [[Satanism|Satanic]] and [[occult]] themes. It contains allusions/references to [[Limbo]], [[Hell]], [[Death]], [[Hades]] and [[Satan]]. The level structure is similar to passages found in the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.
