'''''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure''''' is a [[graphic adventure game]], released in 1989 by  [[Lucasfilm Games]], coinciding with the release of [[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|the film of the same name]]. It was the third game to use the [[SCUMM]] engine.

==Gameplay==

''Last Crusade'' expanded on Lucasfilm Games' traditional adventure game structure by including a flexible point system—the IQ score, or "Indy Quotient"—and by allowing the game to be completed in several different ways.<ref name="beyond-game-design_pg227-228">{{cite book |title=Beyond Game Design: Nine Steps Towards Creating Better Videogames |last=Bateman |first=Chris |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |year=2009 |pages=227–228 |isbn=978-0495926894 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aREEAAAAQBAJ&q=%22Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade%22%20game%20quotient&pg=PA227 |access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref><ref name="pcmag_Dec-12-1989">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[PC Magazine]] |date=December 12, 1989 |page=454 |last=Losee |first=Stephanie |author-link=Stephanie Losee |title=Indiana Jones Takes His Crusade to Your Desktop |volume=8 |number=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CmkZ3THZtwC&q=%22Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade%22%20game%20quotient&pg=PT457 |access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref> The point system was similar to that of [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]]'s adventure games, however when the game was restarted or restored, the total IQ of the previous game was retained. The only way to reach the maximum IQ of 800 was by finding alternative solutions to puzzles, such as fighting a guard instead of avoiding him.<ref name="beyond-game-design_pg227-228"/> This countered one common criticism of adventures games, whereby since there is only one way to finish the game, they have no replay value.<ref name="beyond-game-design_pg227-228"/><ref name="pcmag_Dec-12-1989"/> Also, the point system helped the game to appeal to a variety of player types. Some of the alternative fights, such as the one with the [[Zeppelin]] attendant, were very difficult to pass, so the maximum IQ was very difficult to achieve.

A replica of [[Henry Jones, Sr.|Henry Jones]]' Grail diary was included with earlier versions of the game.<ref name="pcmag_Dec-12-1989"/><ref>{{cite book |title=A Bibliography of Modern Arthuriana (1500-200) |publisher=[[Boydell & Brewer]] |year=2006 |pages=597–598 |isbn=9781843840688 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3C_hGEGdqcIC&q=%22Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade%22%20game%20diary&pg=PA597 |access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref> While very different from the film's version, it provided a collection of background information of Indy's youth and Henry's life. The diary was also necessary to solve puzzles near the end of the game, most notably to identify the real Grail. Later versions of the game came with a shortened version of the Grail diary.

==Plot==
The plot closely follows, and expands upon, the film of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. As the game begins, Indiana Jones has returned to his college, after reclaiming the [[Cross of Coronado]]. He is approached by businessman Walter Donovan, who tells him about the [[Holy Grail]], and of the disappearance of Indy's father.

Indy then travels to some of the places seen in the movie, such as [[Venice]] and the catacombs, after meeting fellow archeologist Elsa Schneider. In the process he finds his father held captive in the Brunwald Castle, after passing through the mazelike corridors, fighting and avoiding guards. Then Elsa's double role is revealed when she steals the Grail Diary from Indy. After escaping, father and son pass through Berlin to reclaim the Diary and have a brief meeting with [[Adolf Hitler]]. Then they reach an airport, from where they intend to seek the Valley of the Crescent Moon, by [[Zeppelin]] or [[biplane]]. There are many action scenes, involving punching, and the biplane sequence above [[Europe]], pursued by [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] planes.

Several key elements of the film - such as the Brotherhood of the Grail, Indy's friend [[Sallah]], and the Venice water chase and the desert battle scenes (except for small hidden references) - were not included in the game.

==Development==
The game was released in May 1989 simultaneously with the movie. It was available for [[DOS]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[Mac OS]]. A [[CD-ROM]] version was later released for the [[FM Towns]], with 256-color graphics and a CD Audio soundtrack, as well as a [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] PC version. Many of the scenes unique to the game were conceived by [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] during the creation of the movie.<ref name="CGW">{{Cite news | date = November 1989 | last = Ardai | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Ardai | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Travels with Indy: ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure'' | pages = 72, 74 | issue = 65}}</ref> ''Last Crusade'' was also the first Lucasfilm game to include the verbs ''Look'' and ''Talk''. In several situations, the latter would begin a primitive dialogue system in which the player could choose one of several lines to say. The system was fully evolved in ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'' and remained in all later LucasArts adventures, with the exception of ''[[Loom (video game)|Loom]]''.

==Reception==
UK magazine ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the PC version a score of 91%, praising the graphics, sound and playability and calling it "a brilliant film tie-in and a superlative game in its own right".<ref>{{Cite news | last = Rignall | first = Julian | author-link = Julian Rignall | title = Indy Adventure | newspaper = [[Computer and Video Games (magazine)|Computer and Video Games]] | pages = 62–63 | date = September 1989 | issue = 94}}</ref> In 1989, ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon152">{{cite journal

''The Last Crusade'' became a "sizeable hit", according to [[Hal Barwood]].<ref name="retrogamer">{{cite journal |author=Bevan, Mike |year=2008 |title=The Making of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis |journal=[[Retro Gamer Magazine]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing Ltd.]] |issue=51 |pages=44–49}}</ref> It was Lucasfilm's best-selling game at the time of its release, with sales of over 250,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theinspiracy.com/past-projects.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170325044157/http://www.theinspiracy.com/past-projects.html|archive-date = 2017-03-25|title = Past Projects}}</ref>

In 1991, ''[[PC Format]]'' placed ''The Last Crusade'' on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time. The editors wrote that Indy was recreated on the monitor screen impressively as on the big screen.<ref name=pcformat50>{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[PC Format]] | title=The 50 best games EVER! | date=October 1991 | issue=1 | pages=109–111}}</ref>

==Legacy==
A second ''Indiana Jones'' graphic adventure, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]'', was released in 1992.

Two supposed successors to ''Fate of Atlantis'', ''Iron Phoenix'' and ''The Spear of Destiny'', were canceled.<ref name="adventuretreff">{{cite web|url=http://www.adventure-treff.de/artikel/interviews.php?id=49&lang=eng|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718194949/http://www.adventure-treff.de/artikel/interviews.php?id=49&lang=eng|archive-date=July 18, 2011|title=Interview: Hal Barwood|author=Frank, Hans|date=July 18, 2007|publisher=Adventure-Treff|access-date=March 18, 2012}}</ref>
