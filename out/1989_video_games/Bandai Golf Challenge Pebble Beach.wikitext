'''''Bandai Golf Challenge Pebble Beach''''' is a [[golf]] video game released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was developed and released by [[Bandai]]. The game is named after [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach]], a [[golf course]] on [[California]]'s Pacific Coast.

The game implements real world physics in addition to the traditional rules of golf, and consistently places players against the notoriously harsh winds of Pebble Beach. As with the game's real life counterpart, the [[Pacific Ocean]] plays a prominent role on the course and adds to the difficulty of play.<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/bandai-golf-challenge-pebble-beach ''Bandai Golf: Challenge Pebble Beach''] at [[MobyGames]]</ref>
