'''''Nuclear War''''' is a single player [[turn-based strategy]] game developed by [[New World Computing]] and released for the [[Amiga]] in 1989 and later for [[MS-DOS]]. It presents a [[Satire|satirical]], cartoonish nuclear battle between five world powers, in which the winner is whoever retains some population when everyone else on earth is dead.

==Gameplay==
The game's introduction includes an homage to ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''. Each player - one human, four computer-controlled - is represented by a caricature of a national leader (the MS-DOS version allowed more than one human player). If there is a computer-controlled winner at the end of the game, that leader is depicted jumping for joy in the middle of a blasted wasteland, crowing "I won! I won!". If the player wins only the high score board is shown. Once a player (computer or human) loses, all of their stockpiled weapons are automatically launched. It is possible for a game to have no winner because of this. If this happens, a cut scene of the earth shattering and exploding is shown, and the high score table appears (though without any new entries).

==Characters==
The following characters are available in the game; the public figure being satirized is listed in parentheses.
*Ronnie Raygun ([[Ronald Reagan]])
*P.M. Satcher ([[Margaret Thatcher]])
*Infidel Castro ([[Fidel Castro]])

*Mao the Pun ([[Mao Zedong]])
*Jimi Farmer ([[Jimmy Carter]])
*Tricky Dick ([[Richard Nixon]])
*Mikhail Gorabachef ([[Mikhail Gorbachev]])
*Ghanji ([[Mahatma Gandhi]])

==Reception==
In the July 1990 edition of ''[[Games International]]'' (Issue 16), Brian Walker didn't think this was a particularly challenging game, commenting, "All good clean fun with nothing to stretch the brain cells."  He concluded by giving the game a rating of 7 out of 10 for gameplay and 8 out of 10 for graphics, saying, "What lifts the game above average is the omnipresent humour."<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine| last=Walker| first=Brian| date=July 1990 |title=Computer Games|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=16|pages=40}}</ref>

In the July 1990 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue #159), Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser characterized the game as "challenging", despite its tongue in cheek humour. However, they were disappointed that only one player could play the game at a time. Nevertheless, they gave the game an above-average rating of 4{{frac|1|2}} out of 5.<ref name="Dragon159">{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk |journal=Dragon |issue=159 |date=July 1990 |pages=47–53}}</ref>

In the October 1990 edition of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', [[Chuck Moss]] favorably reviewed the game's graphics, fast and brief game play, and humorous computer opponents.<ref name="moss199010">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 | title=Itsy-Bitsy Teeny-Weeny 20-Megaton Bikini | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1990 | accessdate=16 November 2013 | last=Moss |first=Chuck |authorlink=Chuck Moss | pages=36 |issue=75}}</ref>
