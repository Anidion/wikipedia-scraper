}}

'''''Prince of Persia''''' is a [[cinematic platform game]] developed and published by [[Broderbund]] for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] in 1989. It was designed and implemented by [[Jordan Mechner]]. Taking place in medieval [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], players control [[Prince (Prince of Persia)|an unnamed protagonist]] who must venture through a series of dungeons to defeat the evil [[Grand Vizier]] Jaffar and save an [[Damsel in distress#In video games|imprisoned princess]].

Much like ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]'', Mechner's first [[video game]], ''Prince of Persia'' used [[rotoscoping]] for its fluid and realistic animation. For this process, Mechner used as reference for the characters' movements videos of his brother doing acrobatic stunts in white clothes<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-04-01 |title=Prince of Persia's Groundbreaking Character Animations Started Life in a High School Parking Lot |url=https://gizmodo.com/prince-of-persias-groundbreaking-character-animations-s-1842613683 |access-date=2023-10-31 |website=Gizmodo |language=en}}</ref> and [[swashbuckler film]]s such as ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]''.

The game was critically acclaimed and, while not an immediate commercial success, sold many copies as it was ported to a wide range of platforms after the original Apple II release. It is believed to have been the first cinematic platformer and inspired many games in this subgenre, such as ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]''.<ref name=Rybicki08>{{cite web|last=Rybicki |first=Joe |title=Prince of Persia Retrospective |url=http://www.gametap.com/articles/gamefeatures/prince_of_persia_retrospective-05052008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509013828/http://www.gametap.com/articles/gamefeatures/prince_of_persia_retrospective-05052008 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 9, 2008 |work=GameTap |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System |access-date=March 7, 2014 |date=May 5, 2008}}</ref> Its success launched the [[Prince of Persia|''Prince of Persia'' franchise]], consisting of two sequels, ''[[Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame]]'' (1993) and ''[[Prince of Persia 3D]]'' (1999), and two [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]]: ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'' (2003), which was followed by three sequels of its own, and ''[[Prince of Persia (2008 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' (2008).

==Gameplay==
[[File:Prince of Persia 1 - MS-DOS - Gameplay.gif|frame|alt=IBM PC version of Prince of Persia|Mechner used videos of his brother as a reference for the original animation of the game (pictured: [[IBM PC compatible]] version).]]
The main objective of the player is to lead the unnamed protagonist out of dungeons and into a fortress tower before time runs out. This cannot be done without bypassing traps and fighting hostile swordsmen. The game consists of twelve levels (though some console versions have more). However, a game session may be [[Saved game|saved]] and resumed at a later time only after level 2.

The player has a health indicator that consists of a series of small red triangles. The player starts with three. Each time the protagonist is damaged (cut by sword, fallen from two floors of heights or hit by a falling rock), the player loses one of these indicators. There are small jars containing potions of several colours and sizes. The red potions scattered throughout the game restore one health indicator. The blue potions are poisonous, and they take one life indicator as damage. There are also large jars of red potion that increase the maximum number of health indicators by one, and large jars of green potion that grants a temporarily ability to hover. If the player's health is reduced to zero, the protagonist dies. Subsequently, the game is restarted from the beginning of the stage in which the protagonist died but the timer will not reset to that point, effectively constituting a time penalty. There is no counter for the number of [[Life (gaming)|lives]], but if time runs out, the princess will be gone and the game will be over, subject to variations per console versions:{{Overly detailed inline|date=December 2022}}
* The DOS version allows the player already in the very late part of Level 12 to continue after time is out with no extra life, so:
# Restarting the level by pressing appropriate buttons is not death, thus not failing the game yet.
# Any player's death, including having killed Jaffar then falling from excessive floors of heights, also fails the game in which case the Princess is also gone.
# Only defeating Jaffar and exiting Level 12 alive will still save the Princess, with a negative time score in the hall of fame.
* The Macintosh port will not give the player a game over once they reach the final area of Level 12 (stored in data as Level 13), provided they make it there on time. The player must cross the magic bridge and make a screen-transition to a room with falling tiles to be 'safe'; once there, they will always be allowed to continue, regardless of deaths or time expiration. Running out of time at any point before the screen-transition, including the bridge, will result in game over as usual.
* The Super NES remake allows the players to save themselves after time is out, to get the [[game over]] at the end without the princess saved.

There are three types of traps that the player must bypass: spike traps, deep pits (three or more levels deep) and guillotines. Getting caught or falling into each results in the instant death of the protagonist. In addition, there are gates that can be raised for a short period of time by having the protagonist stand on the activation trigger. The player must pass through the gates while they are still open, avoiding locking triggers. Sometimes, there are various traps between an unlock trigger and a gate.

Hostile swordsmen (Jaffar and his guards) are yet another obstacle. The player obtains a sword in the first stage, which they can use to fight these adversaries. The protagonist's sword maneuvers are as follows: advance, back off, slash, parry, or a combined parry-then-slash attack. Enemy swordsmen also have a health indicator similar to that of the protagonist. Killing them involves slashing them until their health indicator is depleted or by pushing them into traps while fighting.

In stage three a skeletal swordsman comes to life and does battle with the protagonist. The skeleton cannot be killed with the sword, but it can be defeated by being dropped into one of the pits.

A unique trap encountered in stage four, which serves as a plot device, is a magic mirror, whose appearance is followed by an ominous [[leitmotif]]. The protagonist is forced to jump through this mirror upon which his [[doppelganger]] emerges from the other side, draining the protagonist's health to one. This apparition later hinders the protagonist by stealing a potion and throwing him into a dungeon. The protagonist cannot kill this apparition as they share lives; any damage inflicted upon one also hurts the other. Therefore, the protagonist must merge with his doppelganger.

In stage eight, the protagonist becomes trapped behind a gate before he can reach the exit. In this stage the Princess sends a white mouse to trigger the gate open again, allowing him to proceed to the next level.

In stage twelve protagonist faces his shadow doppelg√§nger. Once they have merged, the player can run across an invisible bridge to a new area, where they battle Jaffar (once the final checkpoint is reached, the player will no longer get a game over screen even if time runs out, except if the player dies after the timeout). Once Jaffar is defeated, his spell is broken and the Princess can be saved. In addition, the in-game timer is stopped at the moment of Jaffar's death, and the time remaining will appear on the high scores.

==Plot==
The game is set in [[History of Iran|medieval Persia]]. While the [[sultan]] is fighting a war in a foreign land, his [[vizier]] Jaffar, a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]], seizes power. His only obstacle to the throne is the Sultan's daughter. Jaffar locks her in a tower and orders her to become his wife, or she would die within 60 minutes (extended to 120 minutes in the Super NES version, which has longer and harder [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]). The game's [[Prince (Prince of Persia)|unnamed protagonist]], whom the Princess loves, is thrown prisoner into the palace dungeons. In order to free her, he must escape the dungeons, get to the palace tower and defeat Jaffar before time runs out. In addition to guards, various traps and dungeons, the protagonist is further hindered by his own [[doppelg√§nger]], conjured out of a magic mirror.

==Development==
[[File:Prince of Persia 1 - Sketches by Jordan Mechner.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mechner used hand-drawn storyboards such as this to lay out the game's level design and character movements.]]
Development for the game began in 1985, the year [[Jordan Mechner]] graduated from [[Yale University]]. At that time, Mechner had already developed one game, ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]'', for distributor [[Broderbund]]. Despite expecting a sequel to ''Karateka'', the distributor gave Mechner creative freedom to create an original game.<ref name=POPEdge>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/the-making-of-prince-of-persia/ |title=The Making Of: Prince Of Persia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710190803/http://www.edge-online.com/features/the-making-of-prince-of-persia/ |archive-date=July 10, 2013 |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |access-date=October 11, 2015 |url-status=unfit}}</ref> The game drew from sources of inspiration including video games such as ''[[The Castles of Dr. Creep]]'' and ''[[Lode Runner]]'',<ref name=NGen41int>{{cite magazine |title=An Interview with Jordan Mechner|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=41 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=May 1998|pages=75-76}}</ref> literature such as the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' stories,<ref name="PoPhistory1">{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/05/18/ign-presents-the-history-of-prince-of-persia |title=IGN Presents: The History of Prince of Persia (page 1) |author1=Rus McLaughlin |author2=Scott Collura |author3=Levi Buchanan |name-list-style=amp |website=[[IGN]] |date=May 18, 2010 |access-date=June 28, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203230043/http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/18/ign-presents-the-history-of-prince-of-persia |archive-date=December 3, 2014}}</ref> and films such as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''<ref>[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2180/game_design_theory__practice_.php Gamasutra - Features - Game Design: Theory & Practice Second Edition: 'Interview with Jordan Mechner'<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219101314/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2180/game_design_theory__practice_.php |date=December 19, 2014}}</ref> and ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]''.<ref name="GDC2011">{{cite speech|title=Classic Game Postmortem: PRINCE OF PERSIA |first=Jordan |last=Mechner |author-link=Jordan Mechner |event=Game Developers Conference |location=San Francisco, California |date=2011 |url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014634/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PRINCE-OF |access-date=May 30, 2013 |time=38:35 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601195358/http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014634/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PRINCE-OF |archive-date=June 1, 2013}}</ref>

''Prince of Persia'' was programmed in [[Assembly language|6502 assembly]], a low-level programming language.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Caoili|first=Eric|date=April 17, 2012|title=Prince of Persia 's once-lost source code released|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/168709/Prince_of_Persias_oncelost_source_code_released.php|access-date=August 29, 2020|website=Gamasutra|language=en}}</ref> Mechner used an animation technique called [[rotoscoping]], with which he used footage to animate the characters' sprites and movements. To create the protagonist's platforming motions, Mechner traced video footage of his younger brother running and jumping in white clothes.<ref>[http://jordanmechner.com/old-journals/1985/10/october-20-1985/ October 20, 1985 | jordanmechner.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805211658/http://jordanmechner.com/old-journals/1985/10/october-20-1985/ |date=August 5, 2013}}</ref> To create the game's sword fighting sprites, Mechner rotoscoped the final duel scene between [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Basil Rathbone]] in ''The Adventures of Robin Hood''.<ref name="GDC2011"/> Though the use of rotoscoping was regarded as a pioneering move, Mechner later recalled that "when we made that decision with ''Prince of Persia'', I wasn't thinking about being cutting edge ‚Äî we did it essentially because I'm not that good at drawing or animation, and it was the only way I could think of to get lifelike movement."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=An Interview with Jordan Mechner|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|page=108}}</ref> Also unusual was the method of combat: protagonist and enemies fought with [[sword]]s, not projectile weapons, as was the case in most contemporary games. Mechner has said that when he started programming, the first ten minutes of the film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' had been one of the main inspirations for the character's acrobatic responses in a dangerous environment.<ref>[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2180/game_design_theory__practice_.php Gamasutra - Features - Game Design: Theory & Practice Second Edition: 'Interview with Jordan Mechner'<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219101314/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2180/game_design_theory__practice_.php |date=December 19, 2014}}</ref>

During development, the Prince was meant to be a nonviolent character, so the game did not initially include combat.<ref name=NGen41/> However, due to finding the gameplay to be dull and after incessant demand from Tomi Pierce, a colleague of his, Mechner added sword fighting to the game and created Shadow Man, the Prince's doppelg√§nger. Guards were later added when Mechner managed to make use of an additional 12K of the Apple II's memory.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mechner|first=Jordan|date=March 17, 2020|title=How Prince of Persia Defeated Apple II's Memory Limitations {{!}} War Stories {{!}} Ars Technica|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw0VfmXKq54|access-date=October 25, 2020|website=[[YouTube]]|minutes=10}}</ref>

Mechner was offended by the cover art for the [[Sega Genesis]] version, which depicts the prince as a [[Luke Skywalker]] lookalike about to cut down a helpless black guard, but by the time he made his objections it was already being printed.<ref name=NGen41>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Prince of Persia 3D|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=41 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=May 1998|pages=73-74}}</ref>

For the Japanese computer ports, [[Arsys Software]]<ref name=moby/> and [[Riverhillsoft]]<ref name="hg101_pop"/> [[Video game remake|enhanced]] the visuals and redesigned the Prince's appearance, introducing the classic [[turban]] and [[vest]] look.

''Prince of Persia'' received a positive critical reception, but was initially a commercial failure in North America, where it had sold only 7,000 units each on the Apple II and IBM PC by July 1990. It was when the game was released in Japan and Europe that year that it became a commercial success. In July 1990, the NEC PC-9801 version sold 10,000 units as soon as it was released in Japan. It was then ported to various different home computers and [[video game console]]s, eventually selling 2 million units worldwide by the time its sequel ''[[Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame]]'' (1993) was in production.<ref name="hg101_pop">{{cite web|title=Prince of Persia |url=http://hardcoregaming101.net/princeofpersia/princeofpersia.htm |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=June 22, 2012 |author=Kurt Kalata |author2=Sam Derboo |date=August 12, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072416/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/princeofpersia/princeofpersia.htm |archive-date=May 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=pczone>{{cite journal | title=''Prince of Persia 3D'' | author=Pullin, Keith | journal=[[PC Zone]] | date=December 1999 | issue=83 | pages=91}}</ref><ref name=sages>{{cite book | author=Saltzman, Marc | title=Game Design: Secrets of the Sages, Second Edition | date=May 18, 2000 | publisher=[[Brady Games]] | isbn=1566869870 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/gamedesign00marc/page/410 410, 411] | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/gamedesign00marc/page/410}}</ref>

[[Charles Ardai]] of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' wrote that the game package's claim that it "breaks new ground with animation so uncannily human it must be seen to be believed" was true. He wrote that ''Prince of Persia'' "succeeds at being more than a running-jumping game (in other words, a gussied-up [[Nintendo]] game)" because it "captures the ''feel'' of those great old adventure films", citing ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|Thief of Baghdad]]'', ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', and ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]''. Ardai concluded that it was "a tremendous achievement" in games comparable to that of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' in film.<ref name="ardai198912">{{cite magazine | title=Good Knight, Sweet Prince | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=December 1989 | access-date=November 4, 2013 | last=Ardai | first=Charles | authorlink=Charles Ardai | pages=48 & 64 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1989&pub=2&id=66 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510165414/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1989&pub=2&id=66 | archive-date=May 10, 2013 | issue = 66}}</ref>
