L.R.

Mark Alan Willett of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' criticized the game's long installation time, and wrote that the game "attempts a lot but fails at most of it". Willett praised the appearance of the blackjack and baccarat tables, but was disappointed by the "rough-drawn" graphics of gaming chips and the "oddly-cartoonish" shuffling of cards. Willett also criticized the various slot machine games for their lack of modern design and their similar appearances to each other, and noted that their reels spin up rather than down. Willett further wrote that there "is no way to intelligently" determine which slot machines pay more, "So, playing them is an even worse risk than in a real casino." Willett criticized the poker games as well, stating that the computer players "are unable to present a truly human face," whereas real poker requires evaluation of other players' facial expressions.<ref name=Willett>{{cite magazine |last=Willett |first=Mark Alan |title=Place Your Bets: Capstone Bets A Bundle–And Loses–While Konami Makes Their Point |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_107/page/n105 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=June 1993 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |pages=106–108}}</ref>

Dennis Lynch of the ''Chicago Tribune'' praised the graphics and the multiplayer option, considering them to be the game's "big draws".<ref name=Lynch2>{{cite web |last=Lynch |first=Dennis |title=Games for the Bettor |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1993-06-04-9306040083-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |date=June 4, 1991 |access-date=March 12, 2019}}</ref> Paul C.
