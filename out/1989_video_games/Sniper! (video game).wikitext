In the January 1993 issue of ''[[Compute!]]'' (Issue 148), Paul C. Schuytema reviewed the ''Sniper!'' computer game, and suggested players pay for the graphical version rather than try to decipher images composed of ASCII characters, which he found "far too cryptic for my tastes." He noted that although "the game's control logistics seem a little obtuse at first, you can enter a modified boot camp where you explore all of the various commands."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Schuytema |first=Paul C. |date=January 1993| journal=Compute! |issue=148|title= Review of ''Sniper!''}}</ref>
