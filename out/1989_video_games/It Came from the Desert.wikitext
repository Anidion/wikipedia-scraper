'''''It Came from the Desert''''' is a 1989 [[action-adventure game]] by [[Cinemaware]]. It was originally released for the [[Amiga]], but later ported to [[MS-DOS]], as well as released in distinctly different forms to consoles. The [[TurboGrafx-16]] release is distinctly different from the computer versions, in terms of gameplay and presentation. An expansion set '''''Antheads: It Came from the Desert II''''' was released in 1990.

The game is inspired by dozens of 1950s monster movies especially the 1954 mutant-ant classic ''[[Them!]]'', with the title referencing the 1953 horror film, ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]''. The game is a non-linear combination of dialogue boxes and several types of action scenes, typical of contemporary Cinemaware releases.

==Gameplay==
It Came From the Desert on Amiga/DOS is a Point & Click Action/Adventure game with FPS and overhead sections. It is mostly based around detective work, with less puzzle based mechanics and more of a time based exploration mechanic. The Sega Genesis version is an overhead shooter similar to ''[[Ikari Warriors]]''.

==Plot==
The player assumes the role of Dr. Greg Bradley who comes to remote Lizard Breath, California on June 1, 1951. As a [[geologist]], he wants to study a [[meteor]] crash site somewhere in the desert south-west of the small town. Early in the game he learns that the radiation of the meteor has enlarged a local [[ant]] population to an enormous size, however few take his observations seriously. Worried that the ants will soon multiply and spread, he must work against a ticking clock and devise a plan to stop the ants from terrorizing the world. In order to succeed the player must visit many locations ranging from mines, farms, a pub, an airfield, a local radio station and others to find evidence of the ants, then convince townsfolk and authorities of impending doom. At the same time the player must contain the ant infestation.

Only in using every resource available, from workers to the tanks and fighter jets of the National Guard, will the player be able to take the fight to the giant ants.

Mechanically, ''It Came From the Desert'' can be considered [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time]]. Waiting, sleeping (at home or in a hospital bed) and driving around consumes time. As it turns out, the player has a fixed amount of in-game days (15 days, ending with June 15) to succeed. If Bradley fails by this date, the ants will spread, which results in a gloomy ending. To reach a good ending, the player must locate the [[ant colony]] and kill the [[queen ant]].

==Release==
''It Came From the Desert'' was originally released for the [[Amiga]] in 1989 and then was [[porting|ported]] to several other popular systems of the era. In early 1991, Cinemaware released a version for [[MS-DOS]] (ported by [[Level 9 Computing]] in a final attempt to stay in business before they ceased operations in June of that year). This version was, apart from minor palette differences, identical to the original.

A [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]] version was to be released in 1990,<ref name="MM17a1">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Mean_Machines_Issue_17_1992-02_EMAP_Images_GB/page/n11/mode/1up|title=News Special - CES Show: Games List - Megadrive|magazine=[[Mean Machines]]|issue=17|publisher=[[EMAP]]|date=February 1992|page=12}}</ref> but was cancelled. It is an overhead shooter with the main protagonist running around on foot, although it features more free roaming gameplay than traditional [[scrolling shooter]]s. Among the differences in play mechanics, the Sega version allowed the player to create powerups that were fashioned by collecting machinery pieces and joining them together in different combinations. The storyline also differs from the game, instead casting the player not as the scientist from the original but as a teenage pest control worker known as Buzz who makes a variety of improvisational weapons with various materials combined with his pest control equipment. Prior to cancellation, former Black Pearl Software programmer Matt Harmon stated that the Genesis/Mega Drive version was 99% complete.<ref name="GDRI0">{{cite web|author=CRV|url=http://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Interview:Matt_Harmon|title=Interview:Matt Harmon|work=Game Developer Research Institute|date=August 2007|access-date=2020-12-12}}</ref> Although the Sega version was never actually offered for sale, it was distributed as a [[ROM image]] (for use with [[console emulator]]s) from the Cinemaware website after the turn of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web |date=December 17, 2001 |title=It Came from the Desert |url=http://www.cinemaware.com/clsgame_itcame.asp?sel=genrom |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603211756/http://www.cinemaware.com/clsgame_itcame.asp?sel=genrom |archive-date=2004-06-03 |access-date=2020-12-06 |publisher=[[Cinemaware]]}}</ref> Despite the similarity of camera perspective, the Sega version did not appear to reuse any of the graphical elements created for use in the computer-based versions. In 2014, Cinemaware teamed up with ''[[Pier Solar]]'' developer WaterMelon to develop a cartridge version called ''Extended Cut'' with new cutscenes, endings, a new intro sequence and "additional gameplay elements".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-12-01-it-came-from-the-desert-is-getting-an-extended-cut-on-sega-mage-drive|title=It Came From the Desert is getting an Extended Cut... on Sega Mega Drive|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|date=1 December 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|access-date=2 December 2014}}</ref> As of April 2016, the game still has not been released.

The game and its expansion were released on Steam as part of a Cinemaware Anthology collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/326590/|title=Cinemaware Anthology: 1986-1991 on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref>

===TurboGrafx-CD===
The [[TurboGrafx-CD]] version, designed and directed by David Riordan, was released in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/turbocd/916051-it-came-from-the-desert |title=It Came From The Desert for Turbo CD - GameFAQs |website=[[GameFAQs]] |access-date=1 Jun 2013}}</ref> It is a CD-ROM based game that makes use of [[full motion video]] with recorded sequences of live actors. There are also action sequences that use drawn graphical elements (not captured, as seen in games such as ''[[Mean Streets (computer game)|Mean Streets]]'' by [[Access Software]]). The side-scrolling action sequence consists of the player battling ants in tunnels. The TurboGrafx-CD version did reuse the graphical elements from the computer version for the overhead battle sequences, but not for any of the character conversation segments. The storyline and characters were dramatically changed; the player character is no longer a spry scientist from the city visiting the countryside, but a local teenage biker punk named Buzz Lincoln who is somehow immune to the ant queen's mind control and begins a nearly hopeless counterattack against her hordes.

==Reception==
In the July 1990 edition of ''[[Games International]]'' (Issue 16), John Scott commented: "Right from the opening sequence you know that this is something special." He noted the replayability of the game, noting: "There is no way that you will be able to discover all the subplots in one game, and this adds to the lasting appeal of the game." And he also lauded the technical aspects of the game, calling the graphics "first rate", and the sound "the best I've ever come across in ''any'' game." He concluded by rating both gameplay and graphics an excellent nine out of ten.<ref name="gi">{{cite magazine| last=Walker| first=Brian | date=July 1990 |title=Computer Games|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=16|pages=41â€“42}}</ref> Scott also reviewed the sequel ''Antheads'', and found that it was too similar to the original game, noting: "More varied graphics and a complete new soundtrack would have been nice." However, Scott admitted that the low purchase price for what was essentially an add-on chapter made it a worthwhile purchase.<ref name="gi" /> 

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called ''It Came from the Desert'' "one of the most enjoyable programs yet to emerge from Cinemaware ... a very playable and compelling game with many enjoyable hours to be experienced".<ref name="greenberg199004">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=70 | title=It Came from Out of the Disk Drive / Cinemaware's "It Came From The Desert" | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=April 1990 | access-date=15 November 2013 | author=Greenberg, Allen L. | pages=10 |issue=70}}</ref> ''Antheads'' won game of the year honors from ''[[Computer & Video Games]]'' magazine.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 1991, ''[[PC Format]]'' declared ''It Came from the Desert'' one of the 50 best computer games ever. The editors wrote that "a classic '50s B-movie plot combined with some lovely graphics make this a fun game".<ref name=pcformat50>{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[PC Format]] | title=The 50 best games EVER! |date=October 1991 | issue=1 | pages=109â€“111 }}</ref>

==Expansion pack==
[[File:Antheads.jpg|thumb|right|''Antheads'' cover art]]
''It Came from the Desert'' was followed by a 1990 expansion pack called ''Antheads: It Came from the Desert II'' (known in North America as ''It Came from the Desert II'') that required the player to already own the main game. The sequel was directed and designed by David Riordan and was available on store shelves in Europe and via [[mail order]] in North America.

===Plot summary===
The game takes place five years after ''It Came from the Desert'' in January 1956 and expands on the possible second Ant Queen mentioned in the first game's ending. The [[player character]] is Brick Nash, a war veteran and now working as a truck driver who has stolen a detonator for an atomic bomb because his younger brother Andy is a tester for the weapon. Nash fears that the Army's then-ignorance of radiation will cause his brother and other testers to die. Nash must find evidence that will prove radiation is fatal, as well as help the town fend off the new ant army.<ref name="gi2" />

Brick Nash is an ex-fighter pilot who has recently returned from the [[Korean War]], responding to a warning of thousands of potential deaths due to atomic testing in the desert outside the town of Lizard Breath.<ref name="One"/>

Whereas the protagonist of the first game â€“ Dr. Greg Bradley â€“ was known to the people of Lizard Breath who were willing to help him, Nash is a stranger to them.<ref name="CU"/> Townspeople also transform into ants in front of Nash.<ref name="ACE"/>

Mark Patterson from ''[[CU Amiga]]'' (May, 1990) rated the game at 95% and recommended ''Antheads'' to anyone who owned ''It Came from the Desert'', calling it "One of the best sequels to date."<ref name="CU">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cuamiga-magazine-003/page/n25/mode/2up|title=CU Amiga Magazine Issue 003|date=May 1990}}</ref>

Gary Whitta from ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' (Jun, 1990) rated the game at 91% and noted that "''Antheads'' doesn't radically change ''It Came from the Desert''. What you get is the next episode in the story â€“ effectively the same game built around a new mystery, with new puzzles to solve and the odd gameplay tweak. But this is no bad thing, as it's precisely what Desert needed â€“ there's no need to change the core gameplay drastically, as it works brilliantly already."<ref name="One">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-21/page/n71/mode/2up|title = TheOne Magazine Issue 21|date = June 1990}}</ref>

Phil South form ''[[ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment)]]'' (Jun, 1990) declared that ''Antheads'' is "a better game than the original in my view, if only for the scary ant transformation sequence", and felt that people who had not even played the original game would enjoy it: "If anything it's an incentive to buy the original, just to play this version as well."<ref name="ACE">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ace-magazine-33/page/n37/mode/2up|title = ACE Magazine Issue 33|date = June 1990}}</ref>
