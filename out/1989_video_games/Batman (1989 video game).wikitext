'''''Batman''''' (also known as '''''Batman: The Movie''''')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/c64/data/930776.html|title = Batman: The Movie for Commodore 64 - GameFAQs}}</ref> is an [[action video game]] developed and published by [[Ocean Software]] based on the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 film of the same name]]. It was released on 11 September 1989<ref name='ace25diary'>{{cite magazine |title=ACE Diary|magazine=ACE|issue=25|publisher=Future Publishing|date=October 1989|page=120|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=1751&page=120|access-date=7 November 2022}}</ref> for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] with [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[MS-DOS]] and [[MSX]] versions following soon after.<ref>{{WoS game|name=Batman: The Movie|id=0000434}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The game consists of five levels based on events from the film. Each stage has a time limit and a health gauge (represented by Batman's face turning into the Joker's), with Batman losing a life if he runs out of either. The levels have varying gameplay:

# In the first level, styled as side-scrolling gameplay, [[Batman]] fights his way through the Axis Chemical Plant to confront Jack Napier, knocking him into a vat of chemicals and turning him into [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]. Batman can use his Batarangs and grapple gun to defeat enemies. The grapple gun can also be used to climb to higher platforms and swing across gaps.
# In the second level, Batman drives his [[Batmobile]] across Gotham City, dodging traffic and using a grapple to turn corners at high speed. Missing three consecutive turns causes Batman to run into a police roadblock and costs the player one life, regardless of the timer and health gauge.
# The third level is a ''[[Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]]''-like puzzle set in the [[Batcave]], in which Batman is presented with eight consumer products and must identify the three that the Joker has tainted with the deadly chemical Smilex. The player chooses three items at a time and is told how many are correct; a health penalty is incurred for selecting any incorrect items.
# The fourth level takes place during the Joker's parade, in which Batman must fly the [[Batplane|Batwing]] and cut away balloons filled with Smilex gas without crashing into them or the floats to which they are tethered.
# In the fifth and final level, styled similarly to the first, Batman climbs to the top of Gotham City Cathedral and must stop the Joker from escaping on a helicopter.
