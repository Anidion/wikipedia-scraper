{{nihongo foot|'''''Four Trax'''''|フォートラックス|Fō Torakkusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1989 [[racing video game|racing]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Namco]]. It was released in North America by [[Atari Games]], and was ported to the [[Mega Drive/Genesis]] in 1991 as ''Quad Challenge''. 

== Gameplay ==
Players take control of four quad bikes (red for Player 1, white for Player 2, yellow for Player 3, and green for Player 4), which are competing in an "off-road" race. They all have a preset amount of time in which to complete a full lap of the track, but for each lap of the track that is successfully completed, the players' time is extended. However, if one of the players cannot manage to successfully complete the current lap of the track before the time runs out, that player's game will instantly be over and the race will continue without them. The players must complete between three and six full laps of the track in order to win (the number is dependent on how both of the cabinets are set, as with Namco's own ''[[Final Lap]]''). The players can also encounter between four and seven blue CPU-controlled bikes on the track, as the number is dependent on how many people are playing (seven for one player, six for two players, five for three, and four for four).

In North America, the arcade version was the top-grossing new video game on the ''RePlay'' arcade charts in April 1990.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=RePlay: The Players' Choice |magazine=RePlay |date=April 1990 |volume=15 |issue=7 |page=4 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-14-issue-no.-7-april-1990-600dpi/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2014%2C%20Issue%20No.%207%20-%20April%201990/page/n3}}</ref> The Sega Genesis version was released with little commercial fanfare, and it never made major sales figures.<ref name="sega-16">{{cite web | url = http://www.sega-16.com/2011/10/quad-challenge/ | title = Advanced game summary | publisher = Sega-16 | access-date = 2012-01-27}}</ref>

''Four Trax'' is considered to be one of the first [[off-road racing]] games for a console system. It was released more than 10 years before ''[[ATV Offroad Fury]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] brought the genre into the 21st century, but it has become a niche genre again since [[THQ]] discontinued their ''[[MX vs. ATV]]'' series.<ref name="sega-16"/> Even prior to the cancellation of the ''MX vs. ATV'' series, driving an ATV around closed-circuit tracks never appealed much to the mainstream audience of gamers.<ref name="sega-16"/>
