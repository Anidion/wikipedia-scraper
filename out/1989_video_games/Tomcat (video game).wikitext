==Plot==
[[Image:Tomcat in-game screenshot (ZX Spectrum).png|thumb|left|ZX Spectrum screenshot]]

The game is set in the future, some time after the first half of the 21st century. [[Materials science]] has progressed such that human civilisation has found a way to cheaply build many artificial islands. The game is set on one such island, called ''ARTROCK 6'' which is a completely automated defence installation. Due to a freak storm damaging the controlling software, the island has turned against its own side and has started attacking local shipping. The player's task is to fly in and completely destroy the rogue island.<ref name="inlay-1"/><ref name="worldofspectrum-2"/>

==Reception==
Reviews are generally negative, citing a slow running speed, an overly high difficulty level and a lack of originality. Reviewers independently agree that the game has a major flaw in that the enemy bullets are incredibly difficult to see, being the same colour as the background graphics in many versions. The game has also been criticised for having a weak aeroplane theme as it is simply a fixed-speed vertical scroller which could just as easily have a spaceship or any such sprite in its place.

The game scored 24% in ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' magazine.<ref name="Crash-1"/><ref name="YS-3"/><ref name="SU-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue084/Pages/SinclairUser08400045.jpg|title=TOMCAT|publisher=[[Sinclair User]] (issue 84 page 45)|access-date=2010-10-12|first=Jim|last=Douglas|quote=First appearances imply that Tomcat is a rather special vertical shoot-out.}}</ref><ref name="YS-4">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue58/Pages/YourSinclair5800030.jpg|title=The Cheapo Side of Things|publisher=[[Your Sinclair]] (issue 58 page 30)|access-date=2010-10-12|first=Jonathan|last=Davies|quote=The aeroplane theme is a bit weak too, as you could easily replace it with a spaceship or something and not notice the difference.}}</ref><ref name="ready64-1">
