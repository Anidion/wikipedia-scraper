'''''Cratermaze''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Doraemon: Meikyū Daisakusen'''''|ドラえもん {{ruby|迷宮大作戦|めいきゅうだいさくせん}}}}, is a [[video game]] released in 1989 for the [[TurboGrafx-16]] [[video game console]]. The game was re-released by [[Hudson Soft]] for the [[Virtual Console]] on August 13, 2007 in North America, and on August 17, 2007 in Europe and Australia.

''Cratermaze'' is a variation of the Japanese games ''[[Booby Kids]]'' (released for [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]]) and ''Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen'' (1987), an [[arcade game]] released by [[Nihon Bussan]]. A number of contemporary reviews compare the maze-like [[gameplay]] to Hudson's ''[[Bomberman]]'' series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/wii/action/doraemonmeikyuudaisakusen/review.html?sid=6176690|title=Cratermaze review|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|last=Provo|first=Frank|date=2007-08-15|accessdate=2007-12-23}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/813/813102p1.html|title=Cratermaze Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|last=Thomas|first=Lucas M.|date=2007-08-15|accessdate=2007-12-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027160616/http://wii.ign.com/articles/813/813102p1.html|archive-date=2007-10-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Overview==
In the game, the hero Opi ([[Doraemon]] in the Japanese version) is [[Time travel|traveling through time]] with four of his friends when they are captured by the villain Zenzombie. He travels through various eras in time (modern, [[samurai]], future, [[World War II]] and prehistory), collecting treasure to open doors to the next era, and kills enemies by digging holes and burying the enemies. Every 15 of the game's 60 levels, Opi rescues one of his friends. Levels 30 and 60 are [[boss (video games)|boss]] levels where an enormous enemy floats around the screen and can kill Opi with a single touch.

In the Japanese version, [[Doraemon]] replaces the titular character Opi, while Opi's friends are replaced with other ''Doraemon'' characters.
