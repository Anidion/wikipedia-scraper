==Gameplay==
''The Battle of Austerlitz'' is a game in which the 1805 [[Battle of Austerlitz]] between [[Napoleon I]] (France) against Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] (Russia) and [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] (Austria) is simulated.<ref name="CGW70"/>

==Reception==
M. Evan Brooks reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''BOA'' is a Napoleonic simulation of introductory/medium complexity. Its mechanics are dated (and it shows) and it lacks a Napoleonic panache. Given the current state-of-the-art, ''BOA'' is not "art"! However, for the true Napoleonic buff, ''BOA'' may be of some entertainment value."<ref name="CGW70">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M.
