'''''Red Lightning''''' is a [[wargame]] created by Norm Koger and published by [[Strategic Simulations]] for the [[Atari ST]] and [[MS-DOS]] in 1989. An [[Amiga]] conversion followed a year later. The game is set in Europe and hypothesizes a Soviet invasion of [[Western Europe]].

The Box Art for ''Red Lightning'' was created by illustrator Marc Ericksen,{{cn|date=September 2016}} and features Soviet T-80 tanks, with Mig-29s flying air cover, advancing under heavy weather.

==Reception==
In the November 1989 edition of ''[[Games International]]'' (Issue 10), John Inglis noted that the menu driven system "can be a little tedious, as it takes you many keystrokes to move you from one part to the next." However, he concluded by giving the game above average ratings of 4 out of 5 for both game play and graphics, saying, "I would [...] recommend it to traditional wargamers."<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine|last=Inglis|first=John| date=November 1989 |title=Red Lightning|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=10|pages=51–52}}</ref>  

In the January 1994 edition of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', M. Evan Brooks stated that ''Red Lightning''{{'}}s user interface had "serious flaws". While the Atari ST version's mouse-driven user interface was not as flawed, Brooks concluded that "the overall ease of use is sorely lacking in what is supposed to be computer entertainment", and gave the game a poor rating of only 2 out of 5.{{r|brooks198909}}<ref name="brooks199206">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
