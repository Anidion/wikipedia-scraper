'''''TV Sports: Basketball''''' is a 1989 computer [[basketball]] game for the home computers. It was developed by [[Cinemaware]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Mirrorsoft]] for the [[Amiga]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[TurboGrafx-16]]. It is part of the ''TV Sports'' series that included ''[[TV Sports: Baseball]]'' as well as other games based on hockey and [[American football]].

Cinemaware later re-released the game as [[List of commercial video games released as freeware|freeware]].<ref>[http://liberatedgames.org/game.php?game_id=67 TV Sports: Basketball free download] at liberatedgames.org</ref>

==Gameplay==
The game features five-a-side [[basketball]] matches. Players can either play against computer (controlling the players or a coach) or with another person (in versus or cooperative mode). When playing the human could choose to control the same player during the whole match or the one currently in possession of the ball.<ref>[http://www.angusm.demon.co.uk/AGDB/DBM1/TVSBkt.html TV Sports Basketball] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514140750/http://www.angusm.demon.co.uk/AGDB/DBM1/TVSBkt.html |date=2011-05-14 }} at angusm.demon.co.uk</ref>

The game shows a vertical view and has no [[NBA]] license.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The in-game perspective is from half-court. When the ball crosses half-court, a short [[cutscene]] plays showing the players running to the other side of the court as the game transitions to the opposing basket.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' said that ''TV Sports Basketball'' had good sound and graphics, and favorably noted its four-player option.{{r|cgw199109}}

In the May 1990 edition of ''[[Games International]]'', Mike Siggins complimented the "slick" graphics and arcade/strategy options, but found the manual "inexplicably vague". He concluded by giving the game an above average rating of 8 out of 10 for game play, and an excellent rating of 9 out of 10 for graphics, saying that "it doesn't quite recreate the speed and excitement of a real game. However, there is sufficient variety and structure to make this game worth persevering with. Just don't expect a classic".<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine|last=Siggins|first=Mike| date=May 1990 |title=TV Sports Basketball|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=14|pages=52}}</ref>
