'''''Street Rod''''' is a [[racing]] [[video game]] developed by P.Z.Karen Co. Development Group and [[Logical Design Works]], based on an original concept by [[Magic Partners]] and published by [[California Dreams (publishing label)|California Dreams]] for [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[DOS]]. ''Street Rod'' exclusively featured [[Hot rod|Hot Rods]], and early American [[Muscle car|Muscle Cars]], specifically those from [[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler]]. In December 2012, MK Consultancy, from the Netherlands, acquired the copyright ownership of the ''Street Rod'' games{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} and re-released ''Street Rod'' as [[freeware]] in 2014.<ref>[http://streetrodonline.com/2013/01/14/street-rod-and-street-rod-2-no-longer-abandonware/ street-rod-and-street-rod-2-no-longer-abandonware] on streetrodonline.com</ref> ''Street Rod SE'', an updated version which includes all of the vehicles from the ''Car Data Disk'', was also released as freeware in 2014.

==Overview==
Street Rod was released in 1989 and takes place in the year 1963. Equipped with a [[Garage (residential)|garage]] and a small amount of cash ($750), the player character buys a used car from the [[Classified advertising|classified ads]] in a newspaper and embarks on a journey to rise through the ranks by winning races against other racers. Using money earned through races, he can modify the car and compete in more races. Eventually, he will earn the right to challenge The King for his position.

===Gameplay===
The player character starts off on the garage, where cars and parts may be purchased from the newspaper. Purchased parts must be installed by entering the hood of or going under the car and then removing a series of screws to remove parts of the engine or transmission. Then, these parts must be re-installed in order and the bolts replaced, otherwise the car will be undrivable. Installing tires can be done by simply jacking up the car, allowing the old tires to be replaced with new ones. While racing, the car will eventually run out of fuel, which the player must obtain from the gas station.

Competition to race is found by leaving the garage and going to a local diner. Races take place on either a [[dragstrip]] (drag race option) or an open country road. Wagers on the drag races can be set from "Just for kicks!" (no wager) to $10 and $50. On the road, race wagers can be set from $25 to $100 and "[[Vehicle title|pink slip]]s" (the winner receives the loser's car). When the race starts, the player character must wait for a signal to be given to go or else he forfeits the race.

If the player character's car does not have an automatic transmission, he can either "drop the transmission" during the race while keeping the accelerator pressed and shifting gears, or blow the engine if the tachometer dial is in the red zone for too long. In either case, the player character would lose the bet he made and be transported back to the garage, where the car will require a new part to be able to race again.

If the player character crashes his car during a race, he can get the car fixed for a fee, or "junk it", i.e. have the car scrapped and receive the scrap value. However, if he gets involved in a serious crash or the car has already been repaired several times before, he is only able to junk the car. If the player character has no cars in garage and not enough money to buy one, the game ends. During a road race, the player character would occasionally also get chased by the police. The player can choose to keep speeding (fined up to $75 if caught) or pull over (fined $20 immediately). Getting caught by the police results in the race being forfeited, though the bet made for the race is not lost. If the player character cannot afford to pay the fine, he will be sent to prison and the game ends.

The player character has to win a predetermined number of races to be able to challenge The King in a road race. However, this has to be done within the in-game time limit, or it's game over. Upon winning this race, the player character gets The King's car and girlfriend, becoming the new King.

==Reception==
