{{nihongo|'''''Volfied'''''|ヴォルフィード|Vorufīdo}} is an arcade video game designed by [[Fukio Mitsuji]] and released by [[Taito]] in 1989.<ref name="Retro Thing">{{cite web|last=Milecki|first=Adam|title=Retrospective: Volfied from the Arcade|url=http://www.retrothing.com/2008/08/retrospective-v.html|publisher=Retro Thing|access-date=27 January 2014}}</ref> It is a successor to ''[[Qix]]'', with extra features and a futuristic [[science fiction]] aesthetic, rather than ''Qix''{{'}}s abstract geometry style; the player pilots a small spaceship named "Monotros" instead of a marker, and the enemies come in the form of various aliens.<ref name="Retro Thing" />

==Plot==
Taking place in another galaxy, a space pilot is returning to his home world of Volfied, only to discover that it is under attack by an unknown alien force. The few remaining Volfied inhabitants are in an underground location of the planet and signal the pilot to their aid. The pilot flies to Volfied using his ship's defensive weapons in order to eliminate the alien threat and save his people.<ref name="Retro Thing" />

==Gameplay==
The overall gameplay is identical to that of ''Qix'', but the main enemy is no longer a collection of [[line (geometry)|line]]s - instead it varies between levels, and is always accompanied by smaller enemies. When the player's spaceship succeeds in claiming a section of the level, the side containing the main enemy taken as "the outside". Any smaller enemies ending up on "the inside" are killed, resulting in point bonuses. In order to complete a level, the player must claim at least 80% of a level's area. Previously, the limits were 75% in ''Qix'' and 70% in ''Super Qix''. Each level in Volfied has a unique background and enemies. As the player claims areas of the level the cleared area graphic is replaced with the graphic of the next level. Grey boxes also appear on the field — these give the player a random [[power-up]] when collected. Power-ups can grant the player speed or even weapons. There is a special completion bonus on certain levels, often attained by shooting the main enemy.

==Ports==
* I.T.L  developed and Taito published a [[PC Engine]] version in 1989. This port was only released in Japan. 
* A [[Sega Genesis]] conversion was developed by I.T.L and published by Taito in 1991. This port was released in North America as ''Ultimate Qix''.

* A port for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] was developed and released in 2001 as part of the ''[[Simple series|Simple]]'' series. This port was released in North America as ''Qix Neo''.
* A compilation containing ''Volfied'', ''[[Taito Legends]]'', was released by Taito in 2005 for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[Personal computer|PC]].
