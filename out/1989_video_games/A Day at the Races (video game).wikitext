==Gameplay==
''A Day at the Races'' is a game in which the database has room for 500 [[horse]]s and 50 [[jockey]]s, both named and customized by the player.<ref name="gi15"/> The game is a horse racing simulation that allows wagers and payoffs, and for each racing session players can select the number of races, the track conditions, how many horses are in each race and other aspects of the racing card for the day, or allow the computer to select them randomly.<ref name="STart"/> The game is multi-player and allows up to 15 players to compete, although each race has a minimum of 4 horses with the computer controlling any not played by humans.<ref name="gi15"/> Each player has a $1000 bankroll at the beginning of a meet that can be used for betting, or obtaining new horses at auction or by purchasing horses.<ref name="STart"/>

==Reception==
Brian Walker reviewed ''[[Omni-Play Horse Racing]]'' and ''A Day at the Races'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it a rating of 9 out of 10, and stated that "If anything, there is almost too much information to digest in ''ADAR''. In the betting version of the game, ''ADAR'' probably wins by a length."<ref name="gi15">{{cite journal | last = Walker |first = Brian | title =Friends of the Turf: Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 15 | pages =20â€“21 |date=June 1990}}</ref>

Ken Warner for ''[[STart]]'' appreciated the game's attention to details, and called it "an absorbing simulation with its faithful and detailed recreation of horse-racing handicapping information".<ref name="STart">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/STart-Magazine-Issue-23/page/n91/mode/2up|title=STart Magazine Issue 23|date=April 11, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Joystick Hebdo]]'' found the game boring and felt that naming all the horses and jockeys took too much time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/JoystickHebdo18/page/n9/mode/2up|title=Joystick Hebdo 18|date=March 8, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
