'''''Fantasy World Dizzy''''' is an [[arcade adventure]] [[video game]] released in October 1989 by [[Codemasters]] and designed by the [[Oliver Twins]].

The game is considered the third in the ''[[Dizzy (series)|Dizzy]]'' series and was developed under the name ''Dizzy III''. The third Dizzy game to be released, ''[[Fast Food (1989 video game)|Fast Food]]'', was regarded as a spin-off that deviated from the standard Dizzy format.

''Fantasy World Dizzy'' was the first Dizzy adventure to feature many elements which later became standard for the series, such as having three lives, an improved inventory system and a balance between puzzle-solving and hazards. This game also introduced the Yolkfolk: Daisy, Denzil, Dozy, Dylan and Grand-Dizzy.

A [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version titled '''''Mystery World Dizzy''''' was developed in April 1993 but was not released until 24 years later in April 2017. It is available free on the official ''Dizzy'' website. A [[Kickstarter]] campaign has also been started to produce the game on a physical [[Nintendo Entertainment System Game Pak|NES cartridge]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Higton|first1=Ian|title=Unreleased Fantasy World Dizzy NES remake finally comes out - 24 years later|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-07-the-oliver-twins-release-new-old-dizzy-game-to-celebrate-his-30th-birthday|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=8 April 2017|date=8 April 2017}}</ref>
