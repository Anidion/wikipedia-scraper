'''''DJ Boy''''' (DJボーイ) is a 1989 [[beat 'em up]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published in Japan by [[Kaneko]] and in North America by [[Sammy Corporation|Sammy]]. ''DJ Boy'', also known as ''DJ Kid'', was partially based on the [[hip hop culture]] of the U.S. cities. Many of the characters ride around on roller skates rather than walking or running.

==Plot==
The premise of the home console game: A young man named Donald J. Boy (DJ Boy) is a roller fighter taking part of an ultimate fight-race known as "Rollergame", taking place in Cigaretch City, located on the outskirts of New York City. Many people were excited to see DJ Boy, but a roller fighter gang known as the Dark Knights want him out of the competition. Their leader, Heavy-Met Tony, calls his gang to kidnap his girlfriend Maria, who also comes into town and defeat DJ Boy. DJ Boy must rescue Maria, defeat the Dark Knights, and win the Rollergame competition in one adventure. The arcade plot tells a different story. Two rollerskaters named Bob & Tom (the two playable characters) were breakdancing to the beat of their boombox, until it got stolen from rollerskater thieves (possibly the Dark Knights), in which they must find and defeat them in order to retrieve what is rightfully theirs.

==Gameplay==
DJ Boy skates across various stages and utilizes hand-to-hand combat moves in order to defeat opponents, culminating with a battle with a [[boss (video games)|boss]] at the end of each level.  Along the path, the player also encounters prizes, which then can be used later to purchase [[Power-up]]s from a store located at the end of each level (in the home version, the arcade simply tallied these as points). In the console versions of the game, as another game, ''[[River City Ransom]]'', the "prizes" consist of coins that are dropped by defeated enemies, or food items like burgers that restore health.

The Mega Drive version received mixed reviews. ''[[MegaTech]]'' magazine gave a 78% review score, praising the game being fun to play although giving criticism that the game being too easy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/UneditedUK_marktrade/MegaTech_06/page/n75/mode/2up|title=DJ Boy Review|date=June 1992|publisher=[[EMAP]]|isbn=|location=[[United Kingdom]]|pages=77|access-date=December 18, 2020}}</ref> ''[[Sega Power]]'' magazine gave the game an overall 30% score, criticizing the boring gameplay, the levels being too easy, the dull graphics, terrible sound and concluding “A nob beat-em-up with added nobby bits. The levels are dull, the moves limited and the end-of-level bosses too tough to beat.  DJ Boy is unfriendly, unfunny and unfair.”<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/sega-power-33/page/5/mode/2up|title=DJ Boy Review|date=August 1992|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|location=[[United Kingdom]]|pages=40}}</ref> ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' placed the Mega Drive version at #4 in their list of the 10 Worst Mega Drive Games of All Time.<ref>Mega magazine issue 1, page 85, [[Future Publishing]], Oct 1992</ref> Console XS magazine gave the game a 59% score, initially praising the game's originality but also criticizing the game being easy and too simple concluding "With little variation you wouldn’t be playing this for long."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=June 1992|title=DJ Boy Console XS Review|url=https://archive.org/details/console-xs-01/page/128/mode/2up|journal=Console XS|location=[[United Kingdom]]|publisher=[[Paragon Publishing]]|issue=1|page=129|access-date=June 9, 2021}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1992, a sequel, '''''B.Rap Boys''''' (Ｂラップボーイズ), was produced containing similar designs and content. The game features three player simultaneous action using characters that are different from one another (rather than palette swaps), and the optional use of weapons and vehicles, as well as a more robust fighting system. The game's soundtrack was notable for having extensively sampled studio recordings from hip-hop group [[3 Stories High]]. In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''B.Rap Boys'' on their August 1, 1992 issue as being the thirteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=431|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 August 1992|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>
