{{nihongo foot|'''''Gunhed''''',|ガンヘッド|Ganheddo|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --> known as {{nihongo foot|'''''Blazing Lazers'''''|ブレイジングレーザーズ|Bureijingu Rēzāzu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in North America, is a [[vertically scrolling shooter]] game by [[Hudson Soft]] and [[Compile (company)|Compile]], based on the Japanese film ''[[Gunhed (film)|Gunhed]]''. The title was released in 1989, for the [[PC Engine]] in Japan and re-skinned for the [[TurboGrafx-16]] in North America, with ''Gunhed'' unofficially imported for the PC Engine in Europe. In the game, a fictional galaxy is under attack by an enemy space armada called the Dark Squadron, and this galaxy's only chance for survival is the Gunhed Advanced Star Fighter, who must destroy the Dark Squadron and its Super Weapons. The gameplay features fast vertical scrolling and a wide array of weapons for the player to use.

''Blazing Lazers'' was produced by the same personnel who developed other video game series such as ''[[Puyo Puyo]]'' and ''[[Super Bomberman]]'' as well as other games such as ''[[Zanac]]'', ''[[The Guardian Legend]]'', and ''[[DoReMi Fantasy: Milon's DokiDoki Adventure]]''. It was one of the first games released for the TurboGrafx-16 and has received critical praise for its graphical capabilities, lack of slowdown, intense gameplay, and sound. The ''Blazing Lazers'' version of the game has been released on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in North America, Europe and Australia in 2007, and in Japan the following year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/DojYE4QX1WlT8rGEh1_Tquf7_pR40mpV |title=Blazing Lazers for Wii - Nintendo Game Details |access-date=2018-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014133133/https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/DojYE4QX1WlT8rGEh1_Tquf7_pR40mpV |archive-date=2018-10-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hudson.jp/searches/result.php?pf=vc |title=バーチャルコンソール &#124; ダウンロードゲーム &#124; 株式会社ハドソン |access-date=2011-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528204450/http://www.hudson.jp/searches/result.php?pf=vc |archive-date=2011-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Europe VC"/> This same version was later released in Japan on the [[PlayStation Network]] in 2010, and on the [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000007506 |title=ブレイジングレーザーズ &#124; Wii U &#124; 任天堂 |access-date=2018-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014164918/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000007506 |archive-date=2018-10-14 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/blazing-lazers-wii-u |title=Blazing Lazers for Wii U - Nintendo Game Details |access-date=2018-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014130123/https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/blazing-lazers-wii-u |archive-date=2018-10-14 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Europe VC">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/TurboGrafx/Blazing-Lazers--276390.html|title = Blazing Lazers™}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Blazing Lazers gameplay.png|thumb|left|The player dealing with enemy ships, shooting pyramids, and Moais in Area 5]]
The player takes control of the Gunhed Advanced Star Fighter through nine vertically scrolling areas. The player's mission is to destroy the Dark Squadron and its eight enemy Super Weapons. Every area contains one or more [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]], all of which must be destroyed before continuing in the game.<ref name="Manual1">NEC, p. 1.</ref> Players lose a [[Health (gaming)|life]] if they are hit by an enemy or projectile, with the game continuing at a previously–crossed [[Checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]], unless they grab a flashing orb which destroys all on-screen enemies and allows them to continue at the point where their previous ship was destroyed (represented by the icon illustrating the remaining number of ships turning gold). The game ends when all lives have been lost, but the game awards [[Life (video games)#Extra lives|1-up]]s when the player scores a particular number of points. The game provides four [[continue (video gaming)|continue]]s in which players can restart the game at that level in which their previous game ended provided the system is not turned off.<ref name="Manual2">NEC, p. 2.</ref>

The player controls a rapid-fire main cannon, which can either be upgraded or changed to other types of weapons by collecting various numbered [[power-up]]s and purple orbs called "gel capsules".<ref name="Manual3">NEC, p. 3.</ref> Players can collect optional power-ups to help fight through the game such as "multibodies" that shadow their actions, [[Missile|homing missiles]], shields, and enhanced firing capabilities known as "full fire".<ref name="Manual5">NEC, p. 5.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Harris |first=Steve |title=Blaze Your Way Through the Galaxy |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |issue=4 |date=November 1989 |pages=68–69}}</ref> The player carries a limited supply of "cluster bombs" that can be deployed, destroying large quantities of enemies and bosses within the player's vicinity. Players have the function of selecting the speed of their ship, which can be toggled by pressing a button on the gamepad, among five different speeds (the button cycles between them in order). The number of triangles that appear below the player's score designate the speed of the player's ship. This allows players to customize the behavior of their ship at any time, trading off freedom of movement against ease of control: a faster ship is more agile, while a slower ship can be maneuvered more precisely.<ref name="Manual3" />

==History==
''Blazing Lazers'' was co-produced by [[Hudson Soft]] and [[Compile (company)|Compile]]. The game was directed by Masamitsu "Moo" Niitani, president of Compile and creator of ''[[Zanac]]'', ''[[The Guardian Legend]]'' and the ''[[Puyo Puyo]]'' series;<ref name="Moo">{{cite web |last=Dobson |first=Jason |title=Atlus signs 'family-friendly' Wii puzzler ''Octomania'' for North America |publisher=Joystiq |date=2008-02-07 |access-date=2008-07-24 |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/07/atlus-signs-family-friendly-wii-puzzler-octomania-for-north-am/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208053632/http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/07/atlus-signs-family-friendly-wii-puzzler-octomania-for-north-am/ |archive-date=2008-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mikio Ueyama, director of the ''[[Super Bomberman]]'' series for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/588720-super-bomberman/data |title= ''Super Bomberman'' Release Date |access-date= 2011-12-23 |publisher= [[GameFAQs]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120605151157/http://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/588720-super-bomberman/data |archive-date= 2012-06-05 }}</ref> and Tadayuki Kawada, designer of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] game ''[[DoReMi Fantasy: Milon's DokiDoki Adventure|DoReMi Fantasy]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/569361-doremi-fantasy-milon-no-dokidoki-daibouken/data |title= ''Do Re Mi Fantasy: Milon no DokiDoki Daibouken'' Release Date |access-date= 2011-12-23 |publisher= GameFAQs |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120402193442/http://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/569361-doremi-fantasy-milon-no-dokidoki-daibouken/data |archive-date= 2012-04-02 |url-status= live }}</ref> The game was released as ''Gunhed'' on {{Start date|1989|7|7}} for the Japanese [[PC Engine]] console as a tie-in to the [[live action]] film of the same name.

The game has been considered by game reviewers as one of the better [[shoot 'em up]] video games in the genre as well as one of the best games on the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 gaming console. Japanese game publication ''[[Famitsu]]'' reviewed ''Gunhed'', giving the game a 30 out of 40 score.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?a=page_h_title&title_id=2133|title=ガンヘッド （VC版タイトル：ブレイジングレーザーズ） [PCエンジン] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref> ''Gunhed'', which was unofficially imported for the PC Engine in Europe, received highly positive reviews from British publications ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'',<ref name="CVG"/> ''[[Zero (video game magazine)|Zero]]'',<ref name="Zero"/> and ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'', the latter rating it the fourth best game available for the PC Engine in 1989.<ref name="ACE"/>

''Blazing Lazers'' was reviewed in ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' by a panel of four critics. Donn Nauert and Martin Alessi rated it 9 each; Nauert called it his favorite of the console's launch games, while Alessi called it the best shoot 'em up on any console, opining that the gameplay, bosses, and music are "near perfect". Steve Harris rated it 7, saying that the game takes advantage of the TurboGrafx-16's processors with its graphics and animation, while "the play mechanics steal from the best the category has to offer". Ed Semrad rated it 6, praising the detailed backgrounds and intense action, but found the game eventually becomes repetitive and is ultimately only "slightly better than average".<ref name="EGMreview"/> Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser from ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' reviewed the game in its "The Role of Computers" column, giving the game 5 out of 5 stars.<ref name=Dragon169>{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser |first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk |journal=Dragon |issue=169 |date=May 1991 |pages=61–65}}</ref> ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'' said that it is "one of the fastest games for the TurboGrafx-16" and "will keep you going for hours".<ref name="VGCE">{{cite magazine |title=Here's what the critics are saying about TurboGrafx-16 games |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=24 |date=July 1991 |page=6}}</ref>

In 1997, ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' editors ranked ''Blazing Lazers'' number 77 on their "100 Best Games of All Time", saying that it stands out from other shooters by providing a near-constant stream of power-ups and a corresponding onslaught of enemies, which ensures that the player always has access to good weaponry and makes the game extremely intense, particularly in its later levels.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=100 Best Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=113}} Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.</ref>

''Blazing Lazers'' received further praise after it was released on the Virtual Console. Mike Fahey from [[Kotaku]] describes the game as the "best damn shooter on the TurboGrafx, if not best game overall".<ref name="Fahey">{{cite web |last=Fahey |first=Mike |title=VC Update: Rage of the Lazer Monkeys |website=Kotaku |date=2007-05-21 |access-date=2009-04-14 |url=http://kotaku.com/262056/vc-update-rage-of-the-lazer-monkeys |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510025453/http://kotaku.com/262056/vc-update-rage-of-the-lazer-monkeys |archive-date=2009-05-10 }}</ref> Lucas Thomas from [[IGN]] referred to the game as superior to other shoot 'em up games such as ''[[Super Star Soldier]]'', ''[[Gradius III]]'', and the ''[[R-Type]]'' series. Thomas further asserts that the game had "pushed the [TurboGrafx-16] to its limits".<ref name="Thomas" /> Brett Alan Weiss from [[Allgame]] considered this game as "one of the most highly regarded games in the TurboGrafx-16 library".<ref name="Weiss">{{cite web |last=Weiss |first=Brett Alan |title=''Blazing Lazers''&nbsp;– Overview |url=http://allgame.com/game.php?id=2652 |website=[[Allgame]] |access-date=2009-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114203028/http://allgame.com/game.php?id=2652 |archive-date=November 14, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Frank Provo from [[GameSpot]] said that the game compensates for its plain graphics and aesthetics with intense gameplay and a "ridiculous orgy of firepower". He also lauded the game for its diverse weaponry, lack of graphical slowdown seen in some older console games, and the superior, futuristic audio, which he said has an "optimistic quality" to it.<ref name="GSpot" />

Jeremy Parish from the site [[1UP.com]] praised ''Blazing Lazers'', saying that the game is "drowned in goodness".<ref>{{cite web |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |title=Retro Roundup 5/28: ''Actraiser'', ''Donkey Kong Country 2'', ''Streets of Rage 2'', more! |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=2007-05-28 |access-date=2008-08-12 |url=http://www.1up.com/news/retro-roundup-528 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523055604/http://www.1up.com/news/retro-roundup-528 |archive-date=2011-05-23 }}</ref> Justin Leeper from [[GameSpy]] especially praised the game also for its lack of slowdown, stating that prior to 1989 players could only experience the same in [[Video arcade|arcades]]. He claimed that the game surpassed any game on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] at that time. He lauds the smooth scrolling, lush background graphics, and "catchy tunes".<ref>{{cite web |last=Leeper |first=Justin |title=''Blazing Lazers'' |website=[[GameSpy]] |date=2004-02-29 |access-date=2008-08-12 |url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/501/501617p1.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511220117/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/501/501617p1.html |archive-date=2008-05-11 }}</ref> Paul Glancey from the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based magazine ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave it a score 96%, praising the gameplay, difficulty, graphics and sound, calling it "utterly incredible" and stating that "anyone on the quest for the ultimate shoot 'em up—this is it! THIS IS IT!!".<ref name="CVG" />
