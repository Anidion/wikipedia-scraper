'''''Ballistix''''' is a [[video game]] created by Martin Edmondson for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] and published by [[Psygnosis|Psyclapse]] in 1989. It was also converted to a number of other [[home computer]]s in the same year and the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16]] [[Video game console|console]] in 1991. It is a fictional futuristic [[sports video game|sport]] involving directing a puck to a goal by shooting small balls at it.

==Gameplay==

The game is a unique futuristic sport which has been compared variously to [[pinball]],<ref name="electron"/> the board game [[Crossfire (board game)|Crossfire]]<ref name="zzap"/><ref name="commodore user"/> and [[shove ha'penny]].<ref name="electron"/> The player controls a cursor that can fire a stream of small balls. These are used to direct a puck across a court to score a goal. In the two-player game, this is hindered by an opponent, aiming for the opposite goal. In the single-player game, a form of gravity is the opposition.

The game starts with a simple court but it gets progressively more difficult with added obstacles, simple mazes and bonus items. There are 130 courts in total (64 on the C64, 30 on the BBC/Electron). A court is completed when either player scores three goals. If the computer wins in the single-player game, that is [[game over]] although the game can be restarted from the same court. Goals can score a range of points depending on how far out they are scored from.

The display is an overhead view showing a small section of the court that scrolls to follow the puck.

==Development and release==
The game was developed by Martin Edmondson for the Amiga and Atari ST. It was ported to [[MS-DOS]] and [[Commodore 64]] with these four versions being published by the [[Psygnosis]] sub-label Psyclapse in 1989. It was also converted to the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] by Peter Scott and released for those platforms by [[Superior Software]], also in 1989. In 1991, it was released for the TuboGrafx-16 (published by Psygnosis in the [[United States|US]]) / PC Engine (published by Coconuts Japan in Japan). The cover image designed by [[Melvyn Grant]] was originally used for the 1981 novel ''[[The Steel Tsar]]'' and also the 1984 reissue of [[Judas Priest]] album ''[[Rocka Rolla]]''.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that "many of the levels did not seem particularly creative", but nonetheless recommended the game based on the quality of the graphics and sound, and the many game options.<ref name="seacat198907">{{cite magazine | title=Marbles From Hell | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=61 | date=July 1989 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_61.pdf | accessdate=16 April 2016 | last=Seacat | first=Douglas | pages=35}}</ref> Roland Waddilove in [[Electron User]] gave the game a score of 9/10, concluding that "''Ballistix'' is original, fun and very addictive".<ref name="electron">[http://8bs.com/elecgame/ballistix.htm "Having a Ball"], Electron User, vol 6 no 12, September 1989</ref> Mark Heley in [[CU Amiga]] said the game was "well up to the usual excellent standards of Psygnosis's releases", giving a score of 76%.<ref name="commodore user">[http://amr.abime.net/review_14918 ''Ballistix'' review], CU Amiga/64, May 1989</ref> [[Zzap!64]] praised the "attractive, sharp and very fast moving" graphics and found the two-player game "fun" but were less impressed with the one-player option, awarding an overall score of 72%.<ref name="zzap">[http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=058&amp;page=010&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap&amp;check=1 ''Ballistix'' review], Zzap!64, February 1990</ref>
