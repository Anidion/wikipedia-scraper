'''''Human Killing Machine''''' (unofficially titled as '''''Street Fighter 2: Human Killing Machine''''' and acronym-titled as '''''H.K.M.''''') is a 2D [[fighting game|fighting video game]]. The game was developed by British company [[Tiertex]], who hired external team Blue Turtle (Nick Pavis and Leigh Christian) to produce the graphics, and published by [[U.S. Gold]], released in March 1989. It was touted as a sequel to Tiertex's [[home computer]] conversion of ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]''<ref name="surev" /><ref>Micro Hobby, issue 187, page 38, https://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/MicroHobby/Issue187/Pages/MicroHobby18700038.jpg</ref> (as the two companies later did with ''[[Strider II (1990 video game)|Strider II]]''). It was released for [[8-bit]] and [[16-bit]] home computer formats.

At the time of release, the [[ZX Spectrum]] version of the game was generally well received, scoring 9/10 for graphics in ''[[Your Sinclair]]'',<ref name="ysrev">{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/hkm.htm |title=Human Killing Machine |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> who added "Possibly because of the memory used for the excellent background graphics and big - nay, hooge - sprites, the range of moves available in battle seemed relatively limited. It was, however, still fairly easy to beat opponents". The game scored 78% overall in ''[[Sinclair User]]'',<ref name="surev">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue084/Pages/SinclairUser08400035.jpg |title=Archive - Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> who summed it up with "backgrounds are static, but detailed... main graphics are nicely animated with slick arm and leg movements - maybe the best I've seen in this sort of game. The graphics may even be slightly better [than ''Street Fighter'']". The 73% review in ''[[Crash magazine|Crash]]'' stated "The scenery's really beautiful and the large characters are well drawn and animated",<ref name="crash">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue62/Pages/Crash6200015.jpg |title=Archive - Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> and thought it was "lacking in originality, but still very addictive".

Other versions did not fare as well. ''[[Zzap!64]]'' said of the Commodore versions "repetitive with little skill involved", and gave the game 31%. Maff Evans, a secondary reviewer in the magazine said it was "an incredibly weak program and one of the worst fighting games I've ever seen".<ref name="zzapr">{{cite web|url=http://stadium64.com/covers/fighting/hkm2.htm |title=Adverts & Covers |publisher=STADIUM 64 |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> ''[[Amstrad Action]]'' listed ''HKM'' and ''Street Fighter'' as "some of the most dreadful arcade conversions on the CPC".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/kachorro/docs/amstrad_action_tribute_magazine |title=Amstrad Action Tribute Magazine |publisher=Issuu.com |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

The Spanish magazine Microhobby valued the game with the following scores:<ref>(Spanish) [https://www.soloretro.com/spectrum/human-killing-machine-zx-spectrum-de-us-gold-1988.php Human Killing Machine - ZX Spectrum (1988)] - article on Soloretro</ref> Originality: 40% Graphics: 90% Motion: 80% Sound: 50% Difficulty: 70% Addiction: 80%

Retrospective reviews of the game were more negative. YouTuber [[Stuart Ashen]] featured the Atari ST version of the game on his web series, ''Terrible Old Games You’ve Probably Never Heard Of'', criticizing the shoddy mechanics, jerky control scheme and frame rate, unfair difficulty, poor graphics, lack of sound effects and animation frames, stereotypical characters, and overall lack of improvement from Tiertex's conversion of Street Fighter.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zUkK14bHDk | title=Human Killing Machine Review | website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>
