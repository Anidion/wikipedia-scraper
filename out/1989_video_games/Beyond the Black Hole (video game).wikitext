The player must dive from orbit into the objects and gains points by hitting an object with the orb. Players must keep the orb fueled by maneuvering it through the fueling pods into the service center, and avoid pirates who want to steal the fuel.<ref name="Dragon152"/>

==Gameplay==
''Beyond the Black Hole'' is stereoscopic 3-D arcade game which comes with 3-D glasses. The player is able to use the keyboard, a joystick, or a mouse to move around in space.<ref name="Dragon152"/> The game is playable without the glasses, as the game uses motion, not color, to generate the 3-D effect.{{r|atkin198912}}
