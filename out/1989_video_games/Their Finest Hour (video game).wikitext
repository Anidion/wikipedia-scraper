'''''Their Finest Hour: The Battle of Britain''''' is a [[World War II]] [[combat flight simulation game]] by [[Lawrence Holland]], released in October 1989<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060428061222/http://www.lucasarts.com/20th/history_1.htm LucasArts Entertainment Company | 20th Anniversary]</ref> for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[MS-DOS]] systems. It was the second game in the trilogy of World War II titles by [[LucasArts|Lucasfilm Games]], the others being ''[[Battlehawks 1942]]'' (1988) and ''[[Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe]]'' (1991). The game was released with a 192-page manual written by Victor Cross, that provided a detailed historical overview of the battle and pilots' perspectives. An [[expansion pack]], ''Their Finest Missions: Volume One'', was released in 1989.

==Gameplay==
''Their Finest Hour'' is a simulation of the [[Royal Air Force]] and German [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft during the [[Battle of Britain]] from July to September 1940. It offers eight flyable aircraft, two RAF ([[Supermarine Spitfire]], [[Hawker Hurricane]]) and six Luftwaffe ([[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] E, [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] C-4 "Zerstörer", [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Ju 87 Stuka]], [[Dornier Do 17|Dornier 17]] z-2, [[Heinkel He 111]] H-3, [[Junkers Ju 88]] A-1).

The game pioneered gameplay elements featured in later Lucasfilm releases, such as a mission builder and combat film recorder, the ability to man all the crew positions in a bomber, and a Campaign mode where the historical outcome is decided by the success or failure of the missions flown by the player.

==Reception==
''Their Finest Hour'' received 5 out of 5 stars from ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]''.<ref name="Dragon153">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers| last1=Lesser| last2=Lesser| last3=Lesser| first1=Hartley| first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk|journal=Dragon|issue=153|date=January 1990|pages=76–79, 102}}</ref> ''[[STart]]'' described it as "a great sequel" to ''Battlehawks 1942''. Stating that "Flying 'Finest Hour' is pure pleasure", the magazine concluded that "for the aviation buff, it's a 'must have.'"<ref name="reese199001">{{Cite magazine |last=Reese |first=Andrew |date=January 1990 |title=Their Finest Hour / Lucasfilm Games Launches The Battle of Britain |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv4n6/battleofbritain.html |magazine=STart |volume=4 |issue=6}}</ref>

In the June 1990 edition of ''[[Games International]]'' (Issue 15), Brian Walker admired the packaging, commenting that it was "as handsome as the planes [...] the book (it's not just a manual) that accompanies it sets standards that others will have to be judged against." He noted that "to succeed you'll need to grasp strategy, as well as the joystick." Walker concluded by giving the game a perfect rating of 10 out of 10 for gameplay and 9 out of 10 for graphics, saying, "Though we live in an world of junk [...] there's room for such an outstanding production such as this."<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine| date=June 1990 |last=Walker|first=Brian|title=Role Games|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=15|pages=32–34}}</ref>

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that the game was "even more amazing" than ''Battlehawks 1942''. It praised the graphics, [[sound card]] audio, and documentation, while mildly criticizing the controls when not using a mouse, and concluded that the game would appeal to both action and wargame players.<ref name="sipe199001">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=67 | title=Spartans in Spitfires / Britain's "Thermopylae in the Sky" | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=January 1990 | accessdate=15 November 2013 | author=Sipe, Russell | pages=26 | issue=67}}</ref> The magazine named it as Action Game of the Year in 1990.<ref name="cgw199009">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=74 | title=CGW's Game of the Year Awards | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1990 | accessdate=16 November 2013 | pages=70}}</ref> In 1991 the magazine named the game to its Hall of Fame for games readers rated highly over time,<ref name="cgw199109">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=86 | title=Reopening the Hall of Fame | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | pages=128}}</ref> and a survey of strategy and war games gave it four and a half stars out of five.<ref name="brooks199112">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=89 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: The 1900-1950 Epoch / Part II (M-Z) of an Annotated Paiktography | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
