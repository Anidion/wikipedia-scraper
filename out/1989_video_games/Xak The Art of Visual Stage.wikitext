{{nihongo|'''''Xak: The Art of Visual Stage'''''|サーク}} is the first game in the [[fantasy]] [[role-playing video game]] series ''Xak'' developed and published by [[Micro Cabin]]. It was originally released for the [[NEC PC-8801]] computer system, with subsequent versions being developed for the [[NEC PC-9801]], [[Sharp X68000]], [[MSX|MSX2]], [[TurboGrafx-16|PC-Engine]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]], and mobile phones. The first four versions were re-released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] on online store Project EGG. An English translation of ''Xak: The Art of Visual Stage'' was also released in 2007 on the now-defunct retro gaming service WOOMB.net, and became available on Project EGG.

==Plot==
===Setting and story===
''Xak: The Art of Visual Stage'' features a typical [[high fantasy]] setting. According to the game world's legends, a great war was fought between the benevolent but weakening ancient gods and a demon race, which led to the collapse and eventual mortality of the gods. After this 'War of Sealing', the gods divided the world into three parts: ''Xak'', the world of humans, ''Oceanity'', the world of [[faerie]]s, and ''Xexis'', the world of demons. The demon world of Xexis was tightly sealed from the other two worlds as to prevent reentry of the warmongering demon race. Some demons were left behind in Xak, however, and others managed to discover a separate means to enter Xak from Xexis anyway. This ancient history is displayed in the introduction of ''[[Xak II: The Rising of the Red Moon|Xak II]]''.

One of them, Badu, was a very powerful demon, able to use coercive [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] to make humans do his bidding. Duel, the god of war, managed to defeat Badu and seal him away in a mountain of ice for 250 years. The god later settled in a village known as Fearless to live out the rest of his mortal life.

At the beginning of the game, Badu's prison is broken. Demons overrun parts of Xak once again. In order to stop the ravaging of his lands, the King of Wavis sends a messenger faerie to Dork Kart, a famous warrior living in the village of Fearless. Dork, however, has gone missing. The player takes on the role of Latok Kart, Dork's 16-year-old son, as he meets the messenger faerie, Pixie. Latok embarks on the King's quest to slay Badu, hoping to find his father along the way.

In his travels, Latok is guided by Duel's spirit. Over the course of the game, it turns out that Dork and thus Latok is a descendant of Duel.

===Characters===
Latok is the only playable character in the game. Notable [[non-player character]]s Latok meets include:
* Lou Miri Pixie, the green-haired messenger faerie sent by the King of Wavis that guides Latok along his way.
* Freya "[[Fray in Magical Adventure|Fray]]" Jerbain, a blue-haired girl Latok rescues from a wolf-infested forest. Fray is the main heroine of a ''Xak'' series spin-off, ''[[Fray In Magical Adventure]]'' and its remake, ''[[Fray CD]]'', but during the course of ''Xak'' she does not know yet how to use magic.
* Rune Greed, a green-haired warrior. He is a descendant of Duel as well and is on a quest to slay Badu of his own.
* Rabby, a magician's familiar rabbit given to Latok.
* Duel, the god of war, living on in spirit form.
* Elise, a childhood friend of Latok and the granddaughter of Fearless's mayor. She could be considered as a possible romantic interest of Latok.
* Saria, Latok's Mother, who is blind. Latok has taken care of her ever since his father disappeared.
* Bobby, the pacifist son of the blacksmith Dac of the town of Fearless.
* Nurse Elle, the nurse of the village of Fearless.
* Kane, a magician in the hobbit village of Nemnu who gives Latok a mascot familiar named Rabbie.
* Rachael, a girl whose father is in charge of a resistance hideout against the demons in the Land of Fire.
* Zwoon, a demon disguised as a human man who Latok accidentally sets free.
* Necromancer, a powerful black-robed demon with power over the dead. Necromancer is a recurring villain in the series.
* Badu, the main villain of the game who was recently released from his 250 year imprisonment.
