==Gameplay==

The player is put in the position of a main battle tank [[platoon]] commander in charge of four U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] tanks in a fictional campaign of battles against the [[Soviet Army]] in [[Central Europe]]. The player can give orders to friendly units via a tactical map of the battle area as well as taking control of a single tank - assuming the role of either the tank commander, driver or gunner. Between the battles, surviving crew members increase in military rank and skill&mdash;giving the player an incentive to keep their team alive.

Depending on the player's tastes, the whole game can be played more like an action/simulation game or like a strategy game. As [[platoon]] commander, direct control is limited to the four M1 tanks, however depending on the mission, support units like recon and attack helicopters, [[M2 Bradley]] infantry fighting vehicles, [[M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System|MLRS]] artillery systems or other older [[M60 Patton]] tanks are available and can be given orders via the tactical map.

One feature of the game is the ability to change the viewpoint to a supporting unit to get a "recon" from that unit's perspective. According to the manual, doing this from the M1 tanks was supposedly approximate to a tank commander standing on his tank hull to get a better perspective. The external view is also able to track other objects in the centre of the view; this is not limited to vehicles but can actually track missiles or even tank rounds.

The Campaign typically depicts the rush across the [[Rhine]] by the numerically superior enemy forces. The Campaign starts as defensive with the challenge being to use technologically superior [[NATO]] vehicles to stem the "wave" of [[Warsaw Pact]] vehicles. Success may result on the scenarios gradually putting NATO on the offensive side with objective waypoints to reach/hold.

Terrain is a very important factor as going [[hull down]] was a critical strategy to surviving. Full use of the supporting forces makes success easier with even the infantry disembarking from their IFVs to use [[M47 Dragon]] anti-tank launchers. However, leaving them in one position too long invited an artillery barrage from the opposing force.

==Reception==
A [[United States Army Reserves]] officer and graduate of [[United States Army Armor School|Armor School]], Evan Brooks, stated in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' that ''M1 Tank Platoon'' was the first computer tank game to give the player control over four tanks instead of one. He favorably reviewed the game's documentation, internal and external graphics, and depiction of interdependent combat arms, and concluded that it was "the best armor simulator currently available".<ref name="brooks198912">{{cite magazine | title=M1 Tank Platoon | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1989 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
