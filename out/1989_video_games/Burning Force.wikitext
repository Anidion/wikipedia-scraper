{{nihongo foot|'''''Burning Force'''''|バーニングフォース|Bāningu Fōsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1989 [[shoot'em up|third-person shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Namco]] in Japan. A home conversion for the [[Sega Genesis]] was released worldwide a year later. The player assumes control of the woman space cadet Hiromi Tengenji, a pilot training to become a member of the Space Force, who must complete each level by shooting down enemies with her airbike and avoiding projectiles. Gameplay is similar to ''[[Space Harrier]]'', featuring a fixed camera position behind the player and having similar mechanics. It runs on the [[Namco System 2]] arcade hardware.

In ''Burning Force'', the player controls a space cadet named {{nihongo|Hiromi Tengenji|天現寺ひろみ|Tengenji Hiromi}}, who as part of her final training, must battle high-tech enemies through six worlds of four areas on a futuristic airbike named "Sign Duck". The [[gameplay]] is similar to that of [[Sega]]'s ''[[Space Harrier]]'', but the worlds are divided into four areas and there is no vertical mobility making the game different in its own right; in the first two sections the player controls Hiromi on the airbike, which can move to the left and right, as well as braking and accelerating - and the airbike can also fire bullets and missiles at the enemies. The third area of every world is a boss area and the airbike will be transformed into a flying ship which can move in all directions; the fourth area of each world, however, is a [[bonus stage]] and the player has to collect as many spheres (which have numbers on them) as possible for bonus points.<ref name=hc/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/20090710_301395.html |title=バンダイナムコ、「バーニングフォース」を7月14日にバーチャルコンソール アーケードで配信開始 -GAME Watch |date=10 July 2009 |publisher=Game.watch.impress.co.jp |accessdate=2015-11-07}}</ref>

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Burning Force'' on their December 1, 1989 issue as being the ninth most-popular table arcade game at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=369|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 December 1989|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>

The Sega Genesis / Mega Drive received mixed and mostly mediocre reviews in the West upon the release, including 4/10 from ''ASM'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=9908 |title=DIE Kult-Seite über die alten Spiele-Magazine und Retro-Games! |publisher=Kultboy.com |accessdate=2015-11-07}}</ref> 5/10 from ''Génération 4'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=27&num=415&album=oui |title=Le site des anciennes revues informatiques |publisher=www.abandonware-magazines.org |accessdate=2015-11-07}}</ref> 71% from ''Joystick'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=30&num=662&album=oui |title=Le site des anciennes revues informatiques |publisher=www.abandonware-magazines.org |accessdate=2015-11-07}}</ref> 51% from ''Power Play'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Power.Play.N34.1991.01-kultpower#page/n182/mode/1up |title=Power.Play.N34.1991.01-kultpower |date=3 May 2015 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}</ref> and 77% from ''[[Raze (magazine)|RAZE]]'', which opined "''Space Harrier'' is too old a formula to be successful nowadays."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/raze-magazine-03/Raze_03_Jan_1991#page/n70/mode/1up |title=Raze Magazine Issue 03 |date=January 1991 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}</ref>  The ''[[New Straits Times]]'', in October 1990, dismissed the game as "yet another ... in the line of ''Space Harrier'' clones."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19901025&id=N6RUAAAAIBAJ&pg=4312,3225654&hl=en|title=New Releases|work=[[New Straits Times]]|date=October 25, 1990|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref> It also had mediocre sales.<ref name="NGen21"/>

Retrospectively, Hardcore Gaming 101's Kurt Kalata opined it "is among the better of [''Space Harrier''] clones, not only because it's based on more powerful arcade hardware (the [[Namco System 2]], which ran ''[[Phelios]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie no Densetsu]]'', amongst others), but also because it puts its own unique spin on the formula."<ref name=hc/> ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' listed the Genesis version at number 93 in their "Top 100 Games of All Time", explaining that "what earns ''Burning Force'' its place on this list is level design, the fact that no enemies are repeated from level to level, and the stunning design of the bosses."<ref name="NGen21">{{cite magazine|title=Top 100 Games of All Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=September 1996|page=38}}</ref>
