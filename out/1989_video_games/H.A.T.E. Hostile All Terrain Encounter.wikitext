'''''H.A.T.E. Hostile All-Terrain Encounter''''' is an isometric scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] similar to [[Sega]]'s ''[[Zaxxon]]'', developed by [[Vortex Software]] and released in 1989 for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

== Gameplay ==
The game is set as a training simulator in the year 2320.  Colonised sectors of the galaxy are under alien threat and the player must qualify on "Stripworld" in order to join the Galactic Fighter Pilots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1130|title = Lemon64 - H.A.T.E. - Hostile All Terrain Encounter}}</ref> The only goal is to survive until the end of each level, but extra lives for the subsequent level can be accumulated by collecting plasma cells occasionally left behind by destroyed enemies. The player alternates between an aeroplane and a tank as they progress through 10 levels.
