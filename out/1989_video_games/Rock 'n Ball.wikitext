Compared to the North American version, the bumpers in the Japanese version are separately further and the players have more room to guide their ball around the playing surface. The Japanese version has a higher overall difficulty compared to the North American version despite the latter having bigger arches.<ref name="differencesjpna"/>

==Summary==

There are several gameplay options in the game. Some are; "regular [[pinball]]" for up to four players which resembles a game of [[Pac-Man]] ([[rock and roll]] in the North American version),<ref name="differencesjpna"/> "nineball" where balls are knocked into a [[Bingo (U.S.)|Bingo]] pattern, "battle pinball" (which operates more like ''[[Pong]]'' instead of pinball), and "sports pinball" where the pinball game becomes more similar to a [[association football|soccer]] or [[ice hockey|hockey]] field.<ref name="mobygames"/>

There are three different variations to the "battle pinball" mode; "thunder," "bomber," and the basic "attack" mode. All three of these options uses specialized flippers and a specialized pinball. For example, the "bomber" mode has a pinball that explodes after a certain time limit has been reached and the player's two target switches have been turned into bombs. A switch on the right-hand side of the board activates the special effects in the "attack" mode.

Special guest characters in the Japanese version of the game include the [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man character]] from the video game of the same name, [[:ja:ワルキューレ (ゲームキャラクター)|Valkyrie]] from the video game ''[[Valkyrie no Bōken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu]]'', [[Wonder Momo]] and Kai from the ''[[Babylonian Castle Saga]]'' series.
