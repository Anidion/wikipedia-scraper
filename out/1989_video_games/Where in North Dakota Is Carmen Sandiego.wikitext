'''''Where in North Dakota Is Carmen Sandiego?''''' is a 1989 [[edutainment]] video game. It is the fourth game in the Carmen Sandiego video game series after ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985)|World]]'' (1985), ''[[Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego? (1986)|U.S.A.]]'' (1986), and ''[[Where in Europe Is Carmen Sandiego?|Europe]]'' (1988). Having observed the popularity of the Carmen Sandiego franchise in the education of school children, educators were inspired to develop a [[North Dakota]] version to teach North Dakotans about their state's history and geography.

In contrast to the previous titles which were developed internally by [[Broderbund]], ''North Dakota'' was largely developed for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] by a team of fourteen educators led by computer coordinator Craig Nansen, concept designer Bonny Berryman, and co-chairwoman Mary Littler<ref name=":4" /> collectively known as the North Dakota Database Committee (NDDC) of the [[Minot Public Schools]], who made the game idea a reality.<ref name=":4" /><ref name="auto2">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e80cAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Where+in+North+Dakota+is+Carmen+Sandiego|title=North Dakota Education News, Volume 29, No. 8|year=1995|access-date=October 28, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Booth">{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=GF&s_site=grandforks&p_multi=GF&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB6E94D23C32B0A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Carmen Sandiego Really Gets Around N.D.

==Gameplay==
''Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego?'' is a first-person history and geography-based [[edutainment]] game for the [[Apple II]] platform.<ref name="auto">{{cite web | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/where-in-north-dakota-is-carmen-sandiego | title=Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego? | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | access-date=October 28, 2012 | archive-date=September 27, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927115629/http://www.mobygames.com/game/where-in-north-dakota-is-carmen-sandiego | url-status=live }}</ref> The interface of ''Where in North Dakota...'' is similar to the other games in the series, ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?

''Where in North Dakota ...'' includes 38 locations within the state, 50 famous people connected to it, 16 pun-named gang members, and over 1,000 factual clues.<ref name=":2" /><ref name="Nibble" />

Players begin in the office of the NoDak Detective Agency. They type their name into the crime computer using up to 14 characters<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|title=Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego? - User manual|publisher=Broderbund|year=1989}}</ref> and are informed about the case. Players are sent to the scene of the crime and tasked with capturing Carmen Sandiego and her cronies by questioning witnesses. Using these clues, players decipher the appearance of the imposters and follow their geographic trail<ref name=":2" /> to locations such as the [[International Peace Garden]], [[Cando, North Dakota|Cando]], and the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]].<ref name="Nibble" />

Players always have six days' worth of allotted time to track down the crook and create a correct warrant.<ref name=":7" /> Every time the player captures three imposters, they are promoted to a higher rank and the game's difficulty increases. More difficult clues provided by witnesses are added to the pool, and players must travel to more locations related to the case; the lowest rank requires the player travel to four different locations, while the hardest level has them travel to 14.<ref name=":7" /> They must advance 10 ranks before having an opportunity to catch Carmen herself. When they do catch her, they are placed into the North Dakota Roughrider Detective Hall of Fame, which contains 16 slots.<ref name=":03" />

Solving clues requires research using sources other than the game, which at the time meant almanacs, maps, and biographical dictionaries focused on North Dakota.<ref name="Booth" /> In doing so, players learn facts about the geography, environment, economy, and history of the state, as well as techniques for conducting research, using databases, and deductive reasoning.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbsQAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Where+in+North+Dakota+is+Carmen+Sandiego|title=Exploring the plains states through literature|date=May 16, 1994|publisher=Oryx Press|pages=73|access-date=October 28, 2012|author=Brodie, Carolyn S.|isbn=9780897747622}}</ref> The teacher's guide also suggests the game can be used to teach students skills in: using maps, thinking, studying, comprehension, vocabulary, writing, and computer literacy.<ref name=":7" /> The teacher's guide notes that while skill is an important factor, luck is also very important. The elements of each case are randomly generated which means repeats of the same case can have vastly different results. It is also possible, albeit highly unlikely, for a game not to provide enough character clues for the suspect to be identified, so that even the most conscientious players may occasionally be unsuccessful.<ref name=":7" />

===Screens===
The Main Playing Screen contains the location name, day/time, location description, and four other options that help the player progress.<ref name=":8" /> Notes are written in the Notebook, while warrants are issued in the Crime Lab.<ref name=":8" /> Choosing "Investigate" allows the player to discover Character Clues and Location Clues, while "Go To Gas Station" allows the player to travel to the next location.<ref name=":8" />

===Materials===
Unlike previous ''Carmen Sandiego'' games, rather than including an almanac or reference work, the developers opted to use an online database to provide the clues.<ref name=":0" /> The North Dakotan educators wanted to include computerized materials in the game to allow their teachers to use the software as an instructional tool; this led to them "chang[ing] the ''Carmen Sandiego'' program" and adding 16 different databases to the title with topics like parks and minerals.<ref name=":9">{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9H4OAQAAMAAJ&q=%22where+in+north+dakota+is+carmen+sandiego%22|title=States Get Tailor-Made Geography Software|date=September 1, 1992|work=Education Computer News, Volume 9}}</ref>

In the school version, the game's packaging consisted of a full lesson plan: a binder with a manual, a North Dakota state almanac, and the game on a double-side floppy disk. The binder included other information such as [[head shot]]s of Carmen's henchmen, a map of North Dakota, and a page that asks the player to describe the game's final scene and mail it in to receive a prize. Other pages have a print version of the almanac and information about the cities in the game. A teacher's guide is also included. A second binder contains activities that correlate to the 18 database disks included in the package. A North Dakota centennial blue book and a booklet entitled ''Governors and First Ladies of North Dakota'' were also included in this binder.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/rare-north-dakota-themed-carmen-sandiego-game-has-surfaced-287860.phtml|title=Rare North Dakota-themed Carmen Sandiego game has surfaced|work=destructoid.com|date=February 19, 2015|access-date=April 8, 2015|archive-date=March 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325084524/http://www.destructoid.com/rare-north-dakota-themed-carmen-sandiego-game-has-surfaced-287860.phtml|url-status=live}}</ref> The retail version of the game was cased in a game box stylized like the earlier games.<ref name=":5" />

==History==
[[File:Where in North Dakota Is Carmen Sandiego? NDDC photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The North Dakota Database Committee]]

===Setting the precedent===
In the late 80's, there was a significant issue with geography-based educational software: nationwide programs were often too general to be useful in teaching students about their own state, while software companies were unwilling to make 50 versions of their games. In addition, the burden of making a state-centered program was too much for an individual educator. The solution was special collaborations between software makers and states, with the result being new state-related products for students. This arrangement worked for all parties: educators and students received a useful teaching/learning aid, the state education department got educational software "tailor made to their requirements", and the software company had a guaranteed market and dealt with only one customer thereby being able to cut costs such as marketing considerably. Before ''Where in North Dakota...'', this formula had been tested when North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction collaborated with ''Didatech'' over two years to create a state-specific version of [[Cross Country USA|''Crosscountry USA'']], titled ''Crosscountry North Dakota''. The game turned out to be cost-effective; the state invested $45,000 and supplied information for the software maker to use, while Didatech produced the game and manual. Didatech sold a school version of the software to the state, which then sold it directly to schools; meanwhile Didatech sold a separate retail version through its traditional retail channels. The cost per school was only $65, verses $350 for the site license for a national title. Didatech president Paul Melhus noted that this type of collaboration was better suited to smaller states because they were less bureaucratic, more flexible, and more open to innovation.<ref name=":9" />

===Conception===
[[File:Where in North Dakota Is Carmen Sandiego?.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|An opening screen of the game, indicating its release as part of North Dakota's centennial celebrations.]]
Having observed the popularity of the Carmen Sandiego franchise in the education of school children, educators were inspired to develop a North Dakota version to teach North Dakotans about their state's history and geography.<ref name="auto2" /><ref name=":03"/> In early 1987, the [[Minot Public Schools]] system was looking for "an interesting way to teach students and educators the basics of using a database".<ref name=":4" /> After observing ''Where in the U.S.A.'s'' ability to hold her child's attention for hours,<ref name=":2" /> Bonny Berryman, an eighth grade social studies teacher at [[Erik Ramstad|Erik Ramstad Junior High]],<ref name=":6" /> came up with the idea of a special Carmen Sandiego program that would coincide with the state's centennial year.<ref name=":4" /> She felt the game could teach children how to "retrieve information from computers, rather than memorize it", an important skill given the abundance of available information in the computer age.<ref name=":2" /> She also knew that the franchise had achieved "great acceptance throughout [the] district and state"<ref name=":4" /> and believed the game could appeal to adults who would find it fascinating and informative.<ref name=":2" /> She deemed the Carmen Sandiego games a "novelty", allowing students to have fun while learning; she also liked the opportunity for randomness, and the graphics, color, movement, and sound that other media such as board games did not provide.<ref name=":6" /> She noted that the target market played video games every weekend and this was a franchise with which they were already familiar.<ref name=":6" /> She pitched the idea to Minot Public School System computer coordinator Craig Nansen, who was initially skeptical, describing it as a "pipe dream or pie-in-the-sky idea".<ref name=":6" /> However, he saw promise in the idea of stimulating research by encouraging students to use an encyclopedia or dictionary to decipher clues about their state,<ref name=":2" /> thereby adding a state-based component to the database project.<ref name=":4" /> Additionally, his goal was to represent "'cool' software [that] attract[s] the attention of board members, superintendents, etc. [while being] educationally sound".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nansen <!--<nansen@warp6.cs.misu.nodak.edu>-->|first=Craig|date=1997-10-20|title=Re: Looking for the *coolest* K-12 educational software|url=https://lists.h-net.org/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx|journal=EDTECH|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-date=May 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210524004632/https://lists.h-net.org/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx|url-status=live}}</ref> He subsequently contacted series developer [[Broderbund]] about the possibility of creating the game, a prospect they liked.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":03"/> At the time, the recent success of [[Carmen Sandiego Day]]s had resulted in schools from many states asking Broderbund to make state-specific versions of their games to fit into their Carmen Days.<ref name="Waddell">{{Cite web |url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/htgg/sts145papers/mwaddell_2001_2.pdf |title=Case History: Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"A Mystery Exploration Game" |last=Waddell |first=Matt |website=stanford.edu |access-date=February 6, 2019 |archive-date=April 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421003457/https://web.stanford.edu/group/htgg/sts145papers/mwaddell_2001_2.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Development===
At the time, Broderbund CEO [[Doug Carlston|Doug Carston]] preferred to describe the series as "explorational" rather that "educational". In his opinion the term "educational... translate[d] into 'boring' in kidspeak".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/156322163/ |title=Carmen Sandiego: From Computer to TV Screens |date=January 20, 1992 |work=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |access-date=February 6, 2019 |page=37 |archive-date=February 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227220557/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/156322163/ |url-status=live }}</ref> But when Nansen approached the company, he argued that while the series "wasn't meant to be an educational tool", it greatly appealed to educators and ''Where in'' ''North Dakota...'' should be developed for this purpose.<ref name=":2" /> Nansen recalled that "things fell into place and Broderbund was willing to do it", overcoming his previous skepticism.<ref name=":6" /> Subsequently, he contacted North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction. In March 1987 he was able to secure a $100,000 grant from the state legislature which also liked the idea,<ref name=":6" /> and appropriated the money to help fund the project.<ref name=":03"/> The game interested North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction because of its narrow scope compared with the previous Carmen Sandiego titles and its ability to teach computer skills.<ref name=":11">{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/796091626879787008|title=Software Takes Bite Out Of Learning|last=Knutson|first=Jon|work=Tribune Business|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-date=May 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200529042611/https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/796091626879787008|url-status=live}}</ref> North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction employee Chris Eriksmoen would later speak highly of the collaboration which he compared to that of ''Crosscountry North Dakota''.<ref name=":9" /> By March 1988, Broderbund had not spoken openly about the project, but ''Classroom Computer Learning'' had been informed that there was to be an "imminent" contract between Broderbund and the North Dakota Database Committee (NDDC),<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Holly|date=March 1988|title=Carmen Sandiego in North Dakota?! Where Next?|journal=Classroom Computer Learning|volume=8|issue=6|page=13|id = {{ProQuest|212103257}}}}</ref> and that the project would be available to North Dakota's educators within six to nine months.<ref name=":0" /> The inter-business deal would give Broderbund rights to sell the retail version while North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction would sell the school version.<ref name=":5" />

The Broderbund team agreed to publish the game but required local expertise to create the clues and write the text. As a result, Nansen created the North Dakota Database Committee with teachers who had taught North Dakotan topics in the past.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":03" /> It spent the next two years compiling facts with the help of school districts across the state.<ref name=":03" /> The "educators-turned-game-developers"<ref name="GameHistory"/> came up with the pranks, selected locations, researched clues, wrote informational text such as the teacher's manual, created Carmen's imposters, and sourced graphic material.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /> Afterwards, Broderbund's designers took the team's work, and programmed and tested the game using the interface and structure of its previous Apple II Carmen Sandiego titles.<ref name=":03" /> They also developed graphics, a user manual, and packaging for the retail version.<ref name=":4" /> While there were restrictions on how much the North Dakotan team could deviate from the Carmen Sandiego template, local nuances were added including using four-wheel drive vehicles for travel and changing the words "criminals" to "imposters" and "crimes" to "pranks" to add "a touch of North Dakota nice".<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":03" /> The previous games in the series (''World'' and ''USA'') had been released with almanacs to help the player solve the game's riddles and clues; the state of North Dakota did not have an almanac at the time, so the educators wrote one.<ref name="GameHistory"/>

The project was completed in 1989 for the [[North Dakota Department of Public Instruction|state's Department of Education]] to help mark North Dakota's 100th year of statehood.<ref name="Nibble">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_NLAAAAYAAJ&q=%22Where+in+North+Dakota+is+Carmen+Sandiego|title=Way Up North|journal=Nibble|date=1989|publisher=Micro-Sparc|volume=10|page=12|access-date=October 28, 2012}}</ref> Ultimately, the entire grant was used for the project: $65,000 of the $100,000 was set aside by North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction to purchase an initial order of 2500 copies of the game from Broderbund; the balance of the money was used to pay the North Dakota Database Committee and for advertising and distribution costs.<ref name=":6" /> North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction aimed to recoup their costs by selling copies to North Dakotan schools while Broderbund planned to make a commercial version available.<ref name=":2" />

==Release==
[[File:Where_in_North_Dakota_Is_Carmen_Sandiego?_cover.jpg|thumb|The school version of the game packaged in its binder.]]
A January 1988 edition of ''It's Elementary'' revealed that ''Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego?'' was to be distributed statewide in the coming summer in preparation for North Dakota's centennial celebration in 1989.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Minot Public Schools|date=January 1988|title=Where In North Dakota Is Carmen Sandiego|journal=It's Elementary|volume=2|issue=2}}</ref> However, the game was delayed until February 23, 1989, when an official news release was issued by Broderbund explaining that the game was being made available to both schools and the public.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/796091626879787008|title=North Dakota Celebrates Centennial With Special "Carmen Sandiego" Educational Computer Game|date=February 23, 1989|work=Broderbund Software News Release|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-date=May 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200529042611/https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/796091626879787008|url-status=live}}</ref> Before its official release, a copy of a field-testing version was accidentally leaked, and educators who mistakenly believed it was the finished product began calling and complaining.<ref name=":9" />{{clarify|date=February 2019}}

Nansen saw it as an "enrichment activity"<ref name=":6" /> and a "motivating instructional tool" instead,<ref name=":7" /> merely one of many ways to get students interested in North Dakota.<ref name=":6" /> To promote the game, Nansen conducted seminars in schools across the state, encouraging teachers to incorporate the game, as well as other North Dakotan database games, into their curricula.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":03" /> North Dakota public school districts interested in the program were encouraged to call social studies director of the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction, Curt Eriksmoen,<ref name=":11"/> and before using it had to send at least one educator to one of Nansen's seminars.<ref name=":4" /> North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction would ship copies to qualifying schools across the state.<ref name=":4" /> Meanwhile, the public could order the game from Broderbund Software-Direct at a recommended retail price of $34.95, while educators could order teacher's guides for $10.<ref name=":4" /> There is no proof the game was ever officially sold through retail stores (although one complimentary retail copy was sent to the NDDC for their work on the project).<ref name="Atlas Obscura"/> The game was never officially published; only 10 prototype retail copies were ever produced, which were all mailed to educators involved in the project.<ref name="SD Times">{{Cite news|url=http://sdtimes.com/wild-interfaces-highlight-innovation-gdc/|title=Wild interfaces highlight innovation at GDC - SD Times|date=March 2, 2017|work=[[SD Times]]|access-date=March 3, 2017|language=en-US|archive-date=March 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302201510/http://sdtimes.com/wild-interfaces-highlight-innovation-gdc/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nansen expected the game to be in every North Dakota school that had a computer system, and for it to be as popular throughout the state's education system as the ''World'' and ''U.S.A.'' versions.<ref name=":6" /> Berrryman also saw the game's potential popularity outside North Dakota schools, commenting on its appeal to adults due to its agricultural, immigration, historical, and geographical content.<ref name=":6" />

''Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego?'' ended up selling approximately 5,000 copies; mostly to North Dakota schools and was very popular within the state.<ref name="auto" /><ref name=":03" /><ref name="Waddell" /> With a total of 517 schools in the state (as of 2013), this equates to roughly 10 copies sold to each school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Public_education_in_North_Dakota|title=Public education in North Dakota - Ballotpedia|access-date=August 31, 2016|archive-date=September 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914071101/https://ballotpedia.org/Public_education_in_North_Dakota|url-status=live}}</ref> The game was used in the Grand Forks [[Gifted education|GATE]] program as well as in other classrooms, generally by fifth and sixth graders.<ref name="Booth" /> However, very few copies made it outside of North Dakota; in these cases they were generally people with connections to North Dakota such as grandchildren of North Dakotan residents.<ref name=":5" />

===Contemporary reviews===
''[[InCider]]'' was puzzled by the specificity of the game. When listing the locations of various Carmen Sandiego games, it added that the imposter was also "in North Dakota, of all places".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnlVAAAAMAAJ|title=InCider|date=January 1, 1989|publisher=1001001 Incorporated|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/inCider_89-12/inCider_89-12_djvu.txt |title=inCider 89-12 |website=archive.org |date=December 1989 |access-date=February 7, 2019}}</ref> The ''[[Minot Daily News]]'' described the game as "special software".<ref name=":3" /> The ''[[Grand Forks Herald]]'' expressed surprise that there was "even" a North Dakotan game, though the writer commented that it succeeded in teaching geography in a palatable way and in developing research skills.<ref name="Booth" /> Joseph P.

===Modern reviews===
California-based historian Frank Cifaldi described it as "probably the hardest" Carmen Sandiego game because it had clues based on obscure North Dakotan historical trivia, which are sometimes impossible to solve via an Internet search engine,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/736724605021216768|title=Frank Cifaldi on Twitter|access-date=August 2, 2016|archive-date=May 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200529044027/https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/736724605021216768|url-status=live}}</ref> and later described it as "very challenging".<ref name="GameHistory"/> On the positive side, he felt the game was a "big hit, in terms of a fun story to tell".<ref name="GameHistory"/> Kris Kerzman of ''Inforum'' deemed it "a fascinating piece of [North Dakota]'s history and video game history", and noted its existence could be puzzling even to fans of the Carmen Sandiego franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/kris.kerzman/posts/10157431203675727|title=Kris Kerzman - As promised a couple weeks ago, here's my... - Facebook|website=[[Facebook]]|access-date=August 2, 2016|archive-date=December 17, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231217030327/https://www.facebook.com/kris.kerzman/posts/10157431203675727|url-status=live}}</ref> [[KACL (FM)|Cool987FM]] warned its readers of the difficulty in locating original floppy disks of the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cool987fm.com/the-strangest-fact-about-north-dakota/|title=The Strangest Fact About North Dakota|website=[[KACL (FM)|Cool 98.7 FM]]|date=June 30, 2016|access-date=August 3, 2016|archive-date=August 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807132321/http://cool987fm.com/the-strangest-fact-about-north-dakota/|url-status=live}}</ref> The Gamecola podcast described ''Where in North Dakota...'' as a "weird old PC game" that could be dug up for family game night.<ref name="gamecola.net">{{cite web|url=http://gamecola.net/2015/03/gc-podcast-82-gamecola-sports-league/|title=[NSFW] GC Podcast #82: GameCola Sports League|work=GameCola|date=March 2015|access-date=August 31, 2016|archive-date=October 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023134020/http://gamecola.net/2015/03/gc-podcast-82-gamecola-sports-league/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Atlas Obscura'' deemed the title as "little more than a barely remembered oddity" and akin to a "TV pilot that never went to series".<ref name="Atlas Obscura"/>

==Aftermath==
North Dakota was the first state to adapt Carmen Sandiego into a state-specific video game. According to ''Education Technology News'', the title was "picked up by several states and adapted to their needs".<ref name=":9" /> Though the game was heavily circulated in North Dakota school classrooms in the 1990s, it has become difficult to find in modern times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4869798|title=The 1 Weirdest Thing You Never Knew About Your Home State|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=March 11, 2014|access-date=February 16, 2015|archive-date=December 17, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231217030320/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/weird-facts-states_n_4869798|url-status=live}}</ref> As North Dakota schools updated their computers, floppy disks became obsolete. This, coupled with the small production run, led to the title becoming rare.<ref name=":1" /> Cifaldi referred to it as "one of the rarest video games ever made", and openly encouraged citizens to unearth their copies of the game.<ref name=":03"/> A few school versions have survived; two are located at the [[North Dakota State Library]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odin-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do;jsessionid=3715C5FB758D4E3C32BBDB31837BEDD2?tabs=detailsTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=ODIN_ALEPH000139285&indx=1&recIds=ODIN_ALEPH000139285&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=&vid=nds&mode=Basic&tab=tab1&dscnt=0&vl(freeText0)=carmen%20sandiego&dstmp=1472659061197|title=Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego?|last=North Dakota Database Committee|date=January 1, 1989|publisher=Broderbund Software|via=odin-primo.com|access-date=August 31, 2016|archive-date=February 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212060936/http://odin-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do;jsessionid=3715C5FB758D4E3C32BBDB31837BEDD2?tabs=detailsTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=ODIN_ALEPH000139285&indx=1&recIds=ODIN_ALEPH000139285&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=&vid=nds&mode=Basic&tab=tab1&dscnt=0&vl(freeText0)=carmen%20sandiego&dstmp=1472659061197|url-status=dead}}</ref> while a copy was acquired by TanRu Nomad for his YouTube review.<ref>{{Citation|last=TanRu Nomad|title=Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego?

Frank Cifaldi is a digital archivist, who became fascinated by the game after being shocked by its existence when browsing Wikipedia entries on Carmen Sandiego titles.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://www.redbull.tv/video/AP-1MRD3NMS91W11/eight-bit-archaeologists|title=Eight-Bit Archaeologists {{!}} SCREENLAND S1E6 {{!}} Red Bull TV|website=Red Bull TV|language=en|access-date=April 21, 2018|archive-date=April 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421232321/https://www.redbull.tv/video/AP-1MRD3NMS91W11/eight-bit-archaeologists|url-status=live}}</ref> After conversing with game designer and collector Mike Mika, he discovered that although Mika apparently had every Carmen Sandiego game, he did not have this entry; Mika said its existence was "blowing his mind" since the project sounded like a joke and made no sense.<ref name=":10" /> Cifaldi also discovered that ''Where in North Dakota...'' was the only Carmen Sandiego game not to be represented in the [[National Museum of Play]]'s Broderbund Software Collection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.museumofplay.org/sites/default/files/uploads/Finding%20Aid%20to%20the%20Broderbund%20Software%20Inc.%20collection_091318.pdf|title=Finding Aid to the Brøderbund Software, Inc.

In anticipation of the game's upcoming digital archive, Cifaldi visited Nansen in Minot with a film crew<ref name=":03" /> from June 13–15, 2016. He interviewed those who worked on the project and recorded various locations used in the game. Valuable material such as photographs and internal documentation was also recovered (such as the authentic ''Carmen's North Dakota Almanac'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamehistory.org/a-look-back-at-our-gdc-2017-display/|title=A Look Back at Our GDC 2017 Display – Video Game History Foundation|website=gamehistory.org|date=March 7, 2017|access-date=August 26, 2017|archive-date=July 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729001312/https://gamehistory.org/a-look-back-at-our-gdc-2017-display/|url-status=live}}</ref> Handwritten notes from the NDDC, messages between the developers and Broderbund, classroom worksheet extensions, imagery of development, various builds of the game during its evolution, and the manual were all recovered.<ref name="Atlas Obscura"/> During this visit, Nansen gave Cifaldi one of only three known surviving versions of the game boxed for retail sale.

The game was imaged and made available online, providing Cifaldi with a raw rip of the unused version.<ref name=":1"/> Players need to use an Apple II emulator or write onto old floppy disks and play it on an Apple II.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sabriel.me/lets-play/lets-play-where-in-north-dakota-is-carmen-sandiego/ |title=Let's Play – Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego? |website=sabriel.me |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412110243/http://sabriel.me/lets-play/lets-play-where-in-north-dakota-is-carmen-sandiego/ |archive-date=April 12, 2015 |url-status=dead |access-date=February 7, 2019}}</ref> Cifaldi's copy was later sent to the National Museum of Play to supplement other Carmen Sandiego materials donated to the museum by Broderbund founder Doug Carlston in 2014.<ref name=":03" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofplay.org/press/releases/2014/03/504-br%C3%B8derbund-software-inc-founder-donates-games-and-business-archives|title=Brøderbund Software, Inc.
