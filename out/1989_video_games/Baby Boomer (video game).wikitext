'''''Baby Boomer''''' is a  [[light gun shooter]] released by [[Color Dreams]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[NES Zapper|Zapper]] in 1989 in North America. Cartridges were manufactured and sold without being licensed by Nintendo. In Brazil, Color Dreams licensed the game to Gradiente.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Baby Boomer Gameplay.png|left|thumb|Boomer has fallen down a hole, leading to his instant demise.]]
Baby Boomer left his [[Infant bed|crib]] and set out for the dangerous [[wilderness]] outside of his house.

As Boomer crawls across the screen toward numerous dangers, such as birds of prey and bottomless pits, the player uses the [[NES Zapper]] to shoot hazards before they hurt Boomer. Shooting birds kills them; shooting clouds makes them form ice bridges over pits. Levels include a [[graveyard]], the "Pearly Gates" of [[heaven]], and the pits of [[hell]]. Up to two players can participate simultaneously and use the [[Nintendo Entertainment System#Game controllers|controller]] along with the Zapper.

==Release==
This is the first game by Color Dreams. Like the company's other unlicensed games, rather than the typical grey NES cartridge, ''Baby Boomer'' is [[baby blue]] with a design altered to bypass Nintendo's [[CIC (Nintendo)|10NES]] copy protection system.
