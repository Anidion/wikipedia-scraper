==Gameplay==
[[File:KennyDalgishSoccerManagerScreenshotAtariSTJobSecurity.png|250px|left|thumb|The game shows a [[job security]] rating as one of the statistics.]]
The game is played mainly through [[Computer icon|icon]]s and [[Menu (computing)|menu]]s. A chairman can be consulted if players made the right decision while a [[Physical therapy|physiotherapist]] can check for player injuries and the [[Scout (sport)|football scout]] can find players that can be recruited into the team. Match highlights can be either enable or disabled; but the results tell the identical story as the highlights.<ref name="ysrnry">{{cite web | url = http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/kennydmanager.htm | title = Additional game overview | publisher = YSRNRY.CO.UK| date = | accessdate = 2011-03-26}}</ref>

Prior to each game, players can be transferred to and from the reserves list in order to determine a [[starting lineup]] for each game. Each player is sorted by their offense and defense ratings in addition to their age and ability levels. Players are also reminded when a game is either a league game, a cup games, or a simple friendly match that doesn't determine anything. All transactions are done using the [[English pound]] currency. Even the attendance and amount of money earned from gate fees are tracked in the game.<ref name="stadium64">{{cite web | url = http://www.stadium64.com/gameinfos/kennydalglishsoccermanager/kennydalglishsoccermanager.htm | title = Game information | publisher = Stadium 64| date = | accessdate = 2012-12-31}}</ref>

In the actual game itself, basic 16-color graphics help to keep track of the on-screen football action. [[Loan]]s can be acquired from the in-game bank in order to keep the team afloat; owing too much money to the bank forces the board of directors to fire the player for financial incompetence.<ref name="stadium64"/>

==Reception==
''[[Your Sinclair]]'' magazine gave the ZX Spectrum version of this video game a score of 85 out of 100 (the equivalent to 85% or a B letter grade).<ref name="mobygames"/>
