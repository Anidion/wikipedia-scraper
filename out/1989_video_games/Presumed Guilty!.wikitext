==Reception==
[[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The sloppiness in this game shows throughout, from the errors in the manual through the utilities that don't work properly to the numerous typos and misspellings in the text, the incessant noise of the game (no way to turn off the sound), and the final crash at the end. What might have been a reasonably good game is made frustrating and unenjoyable by the lack of adequate quality control."<ref name="CGW60">{{cite magazine |author=Scorpia |authorlink=Scorpia (journalist) |title="Presumed Guilty" Cosmi's Game of Real Time Intrigue |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=June 1989 |volume=1 |issue=60 |pages=26, 31, 54}}</ref>
