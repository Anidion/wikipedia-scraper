''Action in the North Atlantic'' is a game in which convoys are bound for [[Murmansk]] in spring 1942, and the player can choose either to disrupt those convoys by playing as [[Karl DÃ¶nitz|Grand Admiral Doenitz]], or defend them by playing as [[Dudley Pound|Fleet Admiral Pound]].<ref name="CGW74"/>

==Reception==
Bob Proctor for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' commented that "''Action in the North Atlantic'' is a solid naval strategy wargame for those who do not live and die by state of the art graphics. Like ''Battleship Bismarck'', the research is there, the strategies are varied and, fortunately for ''Action in the North Atlantic'', the scenario is much more flexible."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |date=April 1990 |title=Conflict in the Cosmos |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_70/page/n62/ |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |via=[[Internet Archive]] |number=70 |page=63 |accessdate=2024-03-05 }}</ref> 

Wyatt Lee reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "the game play is fast and efficient. Those who like to play miniatures rules like ''General Quarters'' (no relation to the software publisher) should not be disappointed and those who want a strategy game that can be finished in an hour to an hour and a half should be delighted."<ref name="CGW74">{{cite magazine |last=Lee |first=Wyatt |title=Cruisers, Convoys and the Cost of Command: Two World War II Naval Games |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September 1990 |volume=1 |issue=74 |pages=38, 46, 62}}</ref>

The book ''The PC Games Bible'' said that "The graphics are very average, and the GQS interface takes some getting used to."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Matthews |first1=Robin |last2=Rigby |first2=Paul |date=1992 |title=The PC Games Bible |url=https://archive.org/details/pcgamesbible0000matt/page/242/ |location=Wilmslow, Cheshire |publisher=Sigma Press |via=[[Internet Archive]] |page=242 |isbn=1-85058-332-3 |accessdate=2024-03-05 }}</ref>
