Tony Dillon of ''[[Commodore User]]'' wrote that the game "is fun for a while", but considered it an average beat em' up.<ref name=CUser/> Julian Rignall of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' also considered it "a barely average beat 'em up", expressing disappointment with the game considering its film license.<ref name=CVG/> Gordon Hamlett of ''Your Amiga'' considered it a "substandard" beat 'em up,<ref name=YA>{{cite magazine |last=Hamlett |first=Gordon |date=September 1989 |title=The Running Man |magazine=Your Amiga |location=United Kingdom |page=16}}</ref> while ''[[Zzap!64]]'' wrote that the game consisted of repetitive beat-'em up action with few moves to choose from.<ref name=Zap/>

''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' praised the game and considered it to be a good film [[tie-in]], while mentioning its difficulty, particularly during the puzzle aspect.<ref name=Crash/> Mark Higham of ''[[ST/Amiga Format]]'' said that because the game has only five levels, the game has "ridiculously" hard difficulty and short length.<ref name=Format/> Rignall also criticized the difficulty, saying that it goes as relatively easy at the start and later through much more difficult levels and opponents, resulting in frustration and annoyance.<ref name=CVG/> Hamlett wrote that when a dog knocks the player down and inflicts damage, there is a fair chance that it will turn and do the same again before the players have a chance to respond.<ref name=YA/> Some were critical that only a small portion of the screen is used for gameplay.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=YA/>

The graphics received some praise,<ref name=Crash/><ref name=YS/><ref name=CUser/><ref name=SU/> along with the sound.<ref name=YS/><ref name=CUser/><ref name=TGM/> The game's introduction sequence was mostly praised.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=YS/><ref name=CUser/><ref name=TGM/> Dillon wrote that it was the most impressive part of the game.<ref name=CUser/> Rignall considered the sequence to be among the best he had seen on a computer, but was negative to the graphics overall.<ref name=CVG/> ''Zzap!64'' criticized the game's "dull" graphics and gameplay, but praised the intro sequence.<ref name=Zap/> Higham felt that the graphics and gameplay speed needed improvement; although praising intro sequence with sampled music and digitised images, he concluded that those features are not enough to recommend this game.<ref name=Format/>

Several critics disliked the controls and sluggish gameplay.<ref name=TGM/><ref name=TGM2/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YA/> Reviewing the Amiga version, ''[[The Games Machine]]'' wrote that the game has frustrating gameplay and poor controls.<ref name=TGM/> ''The Games Machine'' later wrote that the Atari ST version plays just as badly as the Amiga game. The magazine wrote that the ZX Spectrum version had slightly improved control but negatively noted that it was still the same basic game.<ref name=TGM2/> Hamlett criticized the Amiga version for its poor joystick response.<ref name=YA/> ''Zzap!64'' stated that the C64 version had slightly better playability than the Amiga version but that it was just as sluggish.<ref name=Zap/>
