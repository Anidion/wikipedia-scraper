'''''The Amazing Spider-Man and Captain America in Dr. Doom's Revenge!''''' is a side-scrolling [[video game]] starring [[Marvel Comics]]' [[superhero]]es [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain America]] battling a host of [[supervillain]]s led by [[Doctor Doom]]. The player alternately controls Spider-Man and Captain America; the character being controlled switches after each battle.

==Characters==
The game featured an assortment of Marvel Comics supervillains through the course of the game, many of whom are relatively minor characters in the comic books: [[Lobo Brothers|Eduardo Lobo]], [[Grey Gargoyle]], [[Machete (comics)|Machete]], [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Oddball (comics)|Oddball]], [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Batroc the Leaper]], [[Zaran]], Rattan (who was created specifically for the game), and finally [[Doctor Doom]] himself. Among the bosses included is also the [[Hulk]] (later revealed to be an illusion by [[Mysterio]]). The game's manual provided biographies on each character in a style similar to the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'', and information about each character was used as a form of [[copy protection]].

==Plot==
After his defeat by Spider-Man, Doctor Doom begins a nefarious revenge plot. Hiring several criminals to become his army, he tracks down and attacks Spider-Man. Spider-Man gets the help of Captain America and sets off to confront Doom, though their mission will be very perilous.


==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave ''Doctor Doom's Revenge'' a mixed review, praising the graphics but noting the game loaded and played very slowly. The review also noted the game was extremely linear, and the controls were unresponsive.<ref name="CGW"/> ''[[Compute!]]'' liked the PC version's graphics and [[sound card]] audio, but the reviewer—a fan of Marvel Comics—stated that the story was not as thought-provoking as the source material.<ref name="ferrell198911">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-11-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_114_1989_Nov#page/n117/mode/2up | title=Dr. Doom's Revenge! | work=Compute! | date=November 1989 | access-date=11 November 2013 | author=Ferrell, Keith | pages=116}}</ref> The magazine described the Commodore 64 version as "a perfect example of a great idea that just doesn't cut it ... the comics are more complex and thus more interesting", calling fights "disappointing" despite the "great" graphics.<ref name="randall198912">{{Cite magazine |last=Randall |first=Neil |date=December 1989 |title=64/128 |url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_115_1989_Dec#page/n13/mode/2up |magazine=Compute! |pages=12, 14}}</ref>

==Development==

Marvel Comics also released a comic book that was only available in the game package. It illustrated the plot leading up to Spider-Man and Captain America's mission to stop Dr. Doom.
