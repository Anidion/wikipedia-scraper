'''''Conflict: Europe''''' is a 1989 [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Personal Software Services]] (PSS) for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]].<ref name="ASM1"/><ref name="STF"/> An [[MS-DOS]] port was released later.<ref name="ASM2"/> The game is considered a follow-up to PSS' [[8-bit]] game from 1985, ''[[Theatre Europe]]''.<ref name="STF"/><ref name="CVG"/>

==Gameplay==
The game presents several scenarios where Anglo-[[Soviet]] relationships have deteriorated to the point of open warfare. The player can choose to lead either [[NATO]] or the [[Warsaw Pact]] in a thirty-day period of hostilities. The main screen displays a map and small monitors for communication and information. The player can choose from options such as nuclear aggression, troop movement, [[chemical attack]]s, negotiation, and air control.<ref name="ACE"/>

Each option has a different screen with specific actions. For example, the [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] terminal requires an authorisation code and offers choices such as launch fire mission or reflex strike. The diplomatic terminal allows for communication with other countries and presenting peace terms or threats to the enemy. The supply readout helps determine if a weak unit can survive until supplies arrive. The [[vidiprinter]] provides reports from army and navy sub divisions. Unit orders are given through the main map screen, which covers Europe and operates on a grid system. Moving the command cursor over a unit and clicking on its destination allows for movement and attacking. Units can move one square per turn, depending on the terrain. The report shows the results of battles, with units either untouched, retreated, or erased from the map. The game ends with a percentage command assessment and the number of civilian casualties.<ref name="ACE"/>
