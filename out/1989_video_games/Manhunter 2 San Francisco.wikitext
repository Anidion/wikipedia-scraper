'''''Manhunter 2: San Francisco''''' is a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[adventure game]] designed by Barry Murry, Dave Murry, and Dee Dee Murry of Evryware and published in 1989 by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Manhunter: New York]]'', developed by the same authors.

The rights to ''Manhunter'' are currently held by [[Activision]] following their acquisition of Sierra's [[intellectual property]] in 2008, but the series is currently considered abandoned, with no plans for resumption.

==Plot==
The game continues the story depicted in ''Manhunter: New York''. The game begins with the player, piloting an Orb ship in pursuit of the antagonist Phil Cook, crash-landing in [[San Francisco]]. Another Manhunter on the ground is killed in the crash, so the player assumes his identity. As the gameplay progresses, the player learns of an organized resistance, experiments that have created mutant slaves, and the goal of the malevolent Orbs. The player is able to turn the mutant slaves back into humans, who go on to kill numerous Orbs in San Francisco. The game reaches its climax when the player is on the verge of catching Phil Cook. Phil narrowly escapes in an Orb ship with the player hanging on to the outside, flying off towards London.
