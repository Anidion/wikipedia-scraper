In the June 1990 edition of ''[[Games International]]'', Brian Walker admired the available customization options, saying that it added a "subtlety" to the game. He called the graphics "excellent", and thought that this would help popularize the game of baseball in the United Kingdom. He concluded by giving the game above-average ratings of 9 out of 10 for game play and 8 out of 10 for graphics, saying, "Quality products like ''Hardball II'' can only spread the word."<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine|last=Walker|first=Brian| date=June 1990 |title=Computer Games|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=15|pages=50}}</ref>
