During a failed attempt to rescue O'Neill, David Wolf learns that the Stealth is to be launched from Drax Island, west of [[Cyprus]], and after a long [[car chase]], he escapes by a means of a [[submarine]]. On his way to Drax, David Wolf is set up by Stock who rigged his plane, but Wolf escapes by stealing his [[parachute]] and lands on a truck driving to the Viper airport base.

Wolf discreetly attempts to reclaim the plane and there he sees O'Neill having escaped. Together they operate the plane against Viper and deliver it to [[USS Nimitz]].
