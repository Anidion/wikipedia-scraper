==Plot==
The game takes place in the Gendorian empire, ruled by a tyrant named Krellane. The unnamed hero's father was part of a resistance movement called the "Jedists," but he ran afoul of Krellane's forces and was forced to flee into the forests, where he founded a hidden town called CrissCross. The hero was raised with martial and magical training, in hopes that he would one day fulfill a prophecy and destroy Krellane. Just as the game begins, Krellane's forces have found the village. The hero awakens to the shrieks of his fellow townsfolk being butchered in the night and soon discovers he is the last survivor.<ref name="CRPG Addict">{{cite web|last=Bolingbroke|first=Chester|title=Game 97: Prophecy I: The Fall of Trinadon (1988)|date=14 April 2013|url=http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2013/04/game-97-prophecy-i-fall-of-trinadon-1988.html|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>

In 1992, ''Computer Gaming World'' retrospectively described it as "Another of the [[The Legend of Zelda|Nintendo-style]], single-character CRPGs, with a plot heavily borrowed from ''[[Star Wars]]''" but with "Fast-paced arcade fighting". They concluded it to be fun for "those who like their action hot and heavy" but not for "those who aren't into arcade-type" combat.<ref name="scorpia199110">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 | title=C*R*P*G*S / Computer Role-Playing Game Survey | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Scorpia | pages=16}}</ref>
