==Gameplay==
[[File:Finehour.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot]]
The player must take control of a Transformer-like battlemech known as Sygnus, who is equipped with a laser cannon, Vernier jump-jets, auto-targeting, and an automatic cooling system. Pushing that joystick twice in the same direction will make Sygnus switch from a march to a dash while he is moving, and the player may not make him change the direction that he is facing in mid-air. He has no "life meter", just a temperature meter which increases when he is hit, and decreases when he is not hit - but, if the timer should run out, his cooling device will break. If he should overheat, the game will immediately be over. The game is made of four stages which must be finished twice.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Finest Hour'' on their October 15, 1989 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade game of the year.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=366|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 October 1989|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>
