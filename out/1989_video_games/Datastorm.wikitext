'''''Datastorm''''' is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] for the [[Amiga]] published by Visionary Design in 1989. Written by Søren Grønbech, it was inspired by the ''[[Defender (arcade game)|Defender]]'' arcade video game and the ''Defender''-like ''[[Dropzone]]'' originally released for [[Atari 8-bit computers]].<ref name="sodan"/>

==Gameplay==
''Datastorm'' allows for a single player to play or two players to play simultaneously or one after the other.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ACEIssue22Jul89|title=ACE Issue 22 Jul 89|last=Dillon|first=Tony|date=July 1989|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ACEIssue22Jul89/page/n35 36]|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/COMPUTEs_Amiga_Resource_Volume_1_Number_4_1989-10_COMPUTE_Publications_US|title=COMPUTE!'s Amiga Resource - Volume 1 Number 4 (1989-10)(COMPUTE!

The player must protect and rescue the 8 survival pods that roll around on the surface of the planet and take them to a warp gate.<ref name=":1" /> An onslaught of enemies try to destroy the spaceship so constantly destroying these enemies and their missiles is necessary. There is also a special type of enemy called an alien lander that captures the pods and whisks them away to the top of the level.<ref name="cvg" /> In addition to standard enemies, there are also [[Mother ship|mother ships]], which act as bosses within the game. These mother ships come in the form of a fleet of fast luminous ships, a large squid or a large skull.<ref name=":0" />

A radar scanner, which is essentially a mini-map is presented along the bottom of the screen and gives a complete view of the entire planet to help keep track of what is going on.<ref name="cvg" /> The game also features autosave, a highscore table, on-screen instructions and level select.<ref name="cvg" /> In terms of weaponry, the ship has lasers, smart bombs, cloaking technology that makes it invincible for a period of time.<ref name="cvg" /> The points increase for each level: on levels 5, 9, 13 and so on, the player gets a new set of eight and the scoring resets.

== Plot ==
The game takes place after the planet Xerxes exploded causing its 8 orbiting colonies to drift into deep space. The inhabitants of these colonies must locate a new home planet so they each send a survival pod out into space to achieve this mission. 

==Development==
The game was announced in May 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Info_Issue_26_1989-05_Info_Publications_US/page/n65/mode/2up|title=Show Report|magazine=[[.info (magazine)|.info]]|page=65|date=May 1989|accessdate=November 12, 2022}}</ref>
