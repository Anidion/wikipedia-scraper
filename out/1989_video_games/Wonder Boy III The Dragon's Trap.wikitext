It was published by Sega and released for the [[Master System]] in 1989 and for the [[Game Gear]] in 1992 as '''''Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap'''''.{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Monster World II: The Dragon's Trap'''''|モンスターワールドＩＩ　ドラゴンの罠|Monsutā Wārudo Tsū: Doragon no Wana||}}.}} It was [[porting|ported]] by [[Hudson Soft]] and released in 1991 for the [[TurboGrafx-16|TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine]] under the name '''''Dragon's Curse'''''.{{efn|Released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Adventure Island'''''|アドベンチャーアイランド|Adobenchā Airando}}.}} It was also ported in 1993 by Brazilian company [[Tec Toy]] under the title '''''Turma da Mônica em o Resgate''''', with the game retooled to include characters from Brazilian [[comic book]] series ''[[Monica's Gang]]'' (''{{Lang|pt|Turma da Mônica}}'').

Reviews from gaming magazines have described the game as one of the best Master System and [[8-bit]] titles of that era.

==Overview==
''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' takes place immediately after the events of ''[[Wonder Boy in Monster Land]]'', Wonder Boy travels into the Mecha Dragon's lair in order to slay him. (Some sources refer to this creature as the "MEKA dragon".<ref>''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' Instruction Manual, p. 1.</ref><ref>''Dragon's Curse'' Instruction Manual, p. 1.</ref>) However, upon doing so, he is inflicted by a curse that transforms him into "Lizard-Man". In the game, the player controls Wonder Boy as he tries to undo this curse by journeying across the land, defeating other dragons, and finally defeating the Vampire Dragon to obtain the Salamander Cross – the only object that can remove his curse.<ref name="Manual2">''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' Instruction Manual, p. 2.</ref>

After completing the first level in the game (a simplified version of the final level from the preceding game ''Wonder Boy in Monster Land''), the player begins as Lizard-Man from Alsedo, a town in Monster Land, and the gameplay becomes [[nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]].<ref name="Thomas">{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Lucas M.|title=''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2009-11-10|access-date=2010-06-11|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/104/1043730p1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114025640/http://wii.ign.com/articles/104/1043730p1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-11-14}}</ref> From there, the player explores and finds items and clues needed for Wonder Boy to access different parts of Monster Land.<ref name="Manual7">''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' Instruction Manual, p. 7.</ref> Gold and additional secondary items can be found by defeating enemies and opening treasure chests. With gold, players can buy additional items and better equipment in shops and restore their [[life meter]] in hospitals. Items with question marks displayed cannot be bought unless the player has "charm", which can be increased by collecting Charm Stones or by equipping certain items.<ref name="Manual12">''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' Instruction Manual, pp. 12–14.</ref><ref name="Manual17">''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' Instruction Manual, p. 17.</ref>

[[File:Wonder Boy III - The Dragon's Trap screenshot.png|thumb|left|Lizard-Man attacks an enemy frog by breathing fire at it in the Desert stage. Above, there are two Fire Shooters.]]

In the game, the player uses the [[D-pad|directional pad]] to move Wonder Boy left or right, crouch down (only possible as Hu-Man or Lizard-Man), or to enter doors. The buttons on the controller are used to attack enemies and to jump. Wonder Boy can attack with his main weapon or with secondary weapons by holding down on the directional pad and pressing the attack button. Pressing the pause button brings up the Status Screen (and pauses the game if Wonder Boy is fighting a dragon).<ref>''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' Instruction Manual, p. 3.</ref> Wonder Boy has a life meter shown on the top of the gameplay area as a series of hearts. When all hearts turn black, Wonder Boy dies and the [[game over|game ends]], but if he has a life potion ("medicine vial" in ''Dragon's Curse'') remaining, he will revive with some of the hearts refilled. After the game ends, the player is taken to a "[[continue (video games)|continue]] screen"; there the player has an opportunity to win a free life potion before restarting the game at the town.<ref>''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' Instruction Manual, p. 9.</ref><ref name="DCManual23">''Dragon's Curse'' Instruction Manual, pp. 2–3.</ref> Players can visit the town's church to receive a [[password (video games)|password]] in order to continue the game at a later time. The password saves the player's current form, equipment, and amount of gold; but it does not save any secondary weapons or life potions in stock.<ref>''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' Instruction Manual, p. 6.</ref> ''Dragon's Curse'' has a "file cabinet" which allows players to store passwords into the game's memory.<ref name="DCManual23"/>

Throughout the game, players go through differently-themed levels: underwater, desert, jungle, cave, and sky. At the end of each level is a different dragon.<ref>''Dragon's Curse'' Instruction Manual, p. 7.</ref> After defeating a dragon, Wonder Boy changes form, and his abilities change.<ref name="Manual7"/> Wonder Boy begins the game as Hu-Man, equipped with all eight hearts and the strongest equipment.<ref name="Thomas"/><ref name="DCManual13">''Dragon's Curse'' Instruction Manual, pp. 1, 3.</ref> He turns into Lizard-Man after defeating and being cursed by the Mecha Dragon in the first level. At that point, he loses all equipment and all hearts except one.<ref name="DCManual13"/> Lizard-Man attacks enemies by breathing fire at them and he can duck, but must use his fire breath to defend against enemy projectiles as he does not hold a shield in front of him.<ref name="Thomas"/><ref name="Manual7"/> He can assume other different forms throughout the game: Mouse-Man can walk on walls and ceilings designated by checkered "mouse blocks",<ref name="Walnum">{{cite journal|last=Walnum|first=Clayton|title=Going for the Dragons: A Player's Guide to ''Wonder Boy&nbsp;III''|journal=[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment|VideoGames&nbsp;& Computer Entertainment]]|issue=12|date=January 1990|pages=72–79}}</ref> Piranha-Man can swim freely underwater and can access underwater places (such as the ship) which the other forms cannot, Lion-Man attacks enemies with his sword by slashing from directly above to directly below him allowing him to attack targets other forms cannot hit because all of them except for Lizard-Man simply thrust their sword, and Hawk-Man can fly freely in the air but takes damage if he enters water.<ref name="Manual7"/>

===Contemporary===
''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'' received wide acclaim from critics upon release. It received coverage in the September&nbsp;1989 issue of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', where they provided a brief overview of the game and a summary of the events in ''Wonder Boy in Monster Land'' leading up to the game's plot.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Semrad|first=Ed|title=Sega Masters – ''Wonder Boy&nbsp;III''|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=3|date=September 1989|page=57}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]'' published a review of the game in its September–October&nbsp;1989 issue, stating that "it's truly an adventure worthy of ''Wonder Boy''".<ref name="GP3">{{cite magazine|author=C.A.T.|title=Sega ProView – ''Wonder Boy&nbsp;III''|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=3|date=September–October 1989|pages=38–39}}</ref> It received extensive coverage in both the January and February&nbsp;1990 issues of ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment|VideoGames&nbsp;& Computer Entertainment]]'', featuring an overview and a walkthrough of the game. The magazine praised the game for its challenge and overall look, which it says "will have you manipulating your control pad for days on end".<ref name="Walnum"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Walnum|first=Clayton|title=A Player's Guide to ''Wonder Boy&nbsp;III'': Part&nbsp;II|journal=VideoGames&nbsp;& Computer Entertainment|issue=13|date=February 1990}}</ref>

Various UK-based video gaming magazines gave ''Wonder Boy&nbsp;III: The Dragon's Trap'' significant coverage. UK magazines ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Mean Machines]]'' – in the latter's premiere issue''&nbsp;''– gave the game positive reviews. ''Computer and Video Games'' praised the animation in particular and called it the best game of its type on that platform, using phrases such as "familiar air of polish and ingenuity" and "piles of addiction guaranteed".<ref name="CVG"/> ''Mean Machines''{{'}}  [[Matt Regan]] said it "ranks as one of the greatest Sega Master System games ever!"; he compared the gameplay to the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' series of video games and praised the game's depth, saying that "there's always something new to discover, be it a key to a previously locked door or even a secret room!" [[Julian Rignall]] praised the game's graphics and the huge world players can explore, which he says contributes to the game's addictiveness. He said that "the combination of adventuring, shooting and platform action results in one of the best games of its type available on any console". Collectively, they praised the game overall presentation and graphics, saying that the sprites complement the background. While they additionally praised its playability for being "accessible from the word go" and longevity, they criticized its sound, saying that it "could have been much better".<ref name="MeanMachines"/>

''[[The Games Machine]]'' complimented the game's colorful backgrounds and sprites with "the [Wonder] Boy himself being particularly well-drawn", while they criticized the Master System version's weak animation on some of the characters as well as its choppy scrolling. They called it one of the best Master System games but complained that it was expensive, saying "do you really want to spend 28&nbsp;quid on it?" The magazine's review of the PC Engine version in the same issue was more positive.<ref name="GamesMachine"/> The magazine's successor, ''[[Raze (magazine)|Raze]]'', reviewed the PC Engine version titled ''Adventure Island''. The magazine praised the game's simplistic and addictive platforming gameplay and its smooth-scrolling graphics, though they said they were "a little blocky". They noted that the game had excellent music which was "worth listening through some headphones".<ref name="Raze"/> ''[[Zero (video game magazine)|Zero]]'', along with praising the game's graphics and music, called it "enormously addictive"; the review said the ability to transform into different forms and hence being able to progress into new areas kept the game fresh.<ref name="Zero"/> ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' magazine in 1989 listed it as one of the top three best Master System games available at the time, along with ''[[Ys: The Vanished Omens]]'' and ''[[California Games]]''.<ref name="ACE"/>

German magazine ''Video Games'' gave ''Wonder Boy&nbsp;III: The Dragon's Trap'' a positive review, saying that the game gave more weight to strategy and tactics, that it "stands out clearly from the two predecessors", and that its graphics became less childlike but more "spectacular". The review continued, saying that its gameplay is a good example of what makes [[action-adventure game]]s addictive to play. It complimented the game's depth and wide array of equipment, saying that it "provides an additional touch, which makes [it] the best thought-out game [at the time]".<ref name="VideoGames"/>

===Awards===
In the December&nbsp;1989 issue of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', in its "Best and Worst of 1989" feature, the game won an award for "[[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Game of the Year]]" for the Sega Master System.<ref name="EGM5">{{cite magazine|title=Best and Worst of 1989|magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly|issue=5|date=December 1989|page=17}}</ref>

Upon the release of the [[TurboGrafx-16]] version ''Dragon's Curse'' to the [[Virtual Console]] in 2007, [[IGN]]'s Lucas Thomas reviewed the game, comparing the opening sequence of the game to the opening sequence of ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''; he proceeded to add that the game parallels with games in the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series, calling the game "a straightforward and simple '[[Metroidvania]]' adventure" but with "several layers of unexpected depth". Thomas noted the game's popularity among fans and that it plays almost exactly the same as the Master System version despite graphics and sound improvements; at the time, there were no Master System games on the Virtual Console. He praised the game's rich sound, gameplay depth, and "colorful and cartoony" graphics, which "was perfectly suited to the TurboGrafx platform".<ref name="Thomas2"/>

IGN's Travis Fahs, in discussing the SMS version, offered another opinion, praising the game as "not only the crowning achievement of the series, but perhaps one of the best games of the 8-bit era", drawing comparisons to both ''[[Super Mario Bros.|Mario]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda|Zelda]]''.<ref name="Fahs">{{cite web|last=Fahs|first=Travis|title=''The Legend of Wonder Boy|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2008-11-14|access-date=2011-01-19|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/930/930245p3.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229232406/http://retro.ign.com/articles/930/930245p3.html|archive-date=2012-02-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> Thomas again reviewed the Master System version of ''Wonder Boy&nbsp;III: The Dragon's Trap'' when it was released two years later for the Virtual Console. In this review, he compares the gameplay to ''[[Metroid]]'' – more specifically the need to gather additional equipment and abilities to advance in the game. While he acknowledged that this version from one of the best Master System games as well as for any 8-bit system, he felt that the Master System's Virtual Console release had a reduced appeal. He said that the TurboGrafx-16 version ''Dragon's Curse'' had already been out for two years and that there was no difference in gameplay between the two versions, but there were improvements in graphics and sound in the TurboGrafx-16 version because of the system's superior capabilities. He also noted that the Master System version suffers from sprite flickering''&nbsp;''– something the TurboGrafx-16 version did not have. Despite the small differences in the two versions, he decided to give the Master System version the same rating as the TurboGrafx-16 version.<ref name="Thomas"/>

[[Allgame]]'s review of the Master System version praised the non-linear gameplay and the ability to change into different forms, saying that it "keeps things interesting and fun" and "keeps the game from getting repetitive". It lauded its visuals and sound effects, saying the "graphics are very colorful and have a cartoon look to them". Criticisms included slippery controls and the difficulty of getting into doors; it said the controls kept the game from obtaining a perfect rating, and the gameplay was still not as good as ''[[Wonder Boy in Monster Land]]''.<ref name="Sutyak"/> The editing staff from magazine ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' listed ''Wonder Boy&nbsp;III: The Dragon's Trap'' as one of the "Perfect Ten Games" for the Master System, calling it "the best in a long and highly convoluted myriad of multi-titled games" and "a great adventure that every Master System fan needs to own". The review praised the game's brisk pace and gameplay, despite the length of the game.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ashley Day |author2=''Retro Gamer'' editing staff |editor1=Rick Porter |editor2=Helen Laidlaw |editor3=Olly Dean |title=Videogames Hardware Handbook: 1977 to 1999 – The Games Machine Collector's Manual|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=[[Bournemouth]]|year=2009|page=117|isbn=978-1-906078-44-7}}</ref>

==Remake==
{{Main|Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap}}

In June 2016, indie developer Lizardcube and publisher DotEmu announced a remake of ''Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'', simply titled ''[[Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap]]'', which was released for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Nintendo Switch]], and [[Xbox One]] in April 2017, with a release on PC to follow in June 2017. The game supports a different, modern visual style, but retains the same gameplay, level design and story. The game was developed in collaboration with series creator Ryuichi Nishizawa.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Grab It Magazine|url=http://www.grabitmagazine.com/blog/post/wonder-boy-remake-announced/|title=Wonder Boy Remake Finally On The Way|date=2016-06-04|access-date=June 4, 2016|first=Chris|last=Stead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629143927/http://www.grabitmagazine.com/blog/post/wonder-boy-remake-announced/|archive-date=June 29, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 

A spiritual successor to ''The Dragon's Trap'', titled ''[[Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom]]'', is also developed by Game Atelier and published by FDG Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia, and PC. The game is also developed in collaboration with Nishizawa, though does not use the ''Wonder Boy'' name due to Sega owning the rights.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/09/13/two-developers-are-bringing-wonder-boy-back-with-two-entirely-different-games |title=Two Developers Are Bringing Wonder Boy Back with Two Entirely Different Games &#124; Kotaku UK |date=14 July 2016 |access-date=2016-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915132030/http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/09/13/two-developers-are-bringing-wonder-boy-back-with-two-entirely-different-games |archive-date=2016-09-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>
