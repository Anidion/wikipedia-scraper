The ''Zelda''<ref name=instructionmanual>''Zelda Instruction''. Nintendo Co., Ltd. 1989.</ref> Game & Watch (model number ''ZL-65'')<ref name=retrogamer10>''Feature: Hardware - Watch A Go Go: Price Guide''. [[Retro Gamer]]. Issue 10. p. 88. November 2004.</ref> is a multi-screen [[Game & Watch]] system developed by Nintendo and released in [[North America]] in 1989.<ref name="hyrule"/> Its gameplay was heavily inspired by [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[Zelda II: Adventure of Link]]'', and it featured an original story described in the manual.

Unlike the other LCD games, this was made by Nintendo and appeared on a Nintendo platform. The handheld console would be Nintendo's penultimate release before the release of the [[Game Boy]] (the last being ''[[Mario The Juggler]]'').

===Gameplay===
Players control [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] and fight through labyrinth chambers on the Game & Watch's lower screen. In the labyrinth chambers, Link faces [[Poe (The Legend of Zelda)|Poe]]-like Ghosts, up to four [[Stalfos]], and a [[Moblin (The Legend of Zelda)|Moblin]]-like Goblin mini-boss.<ref name=famitsu>''[http://www.famitsu.com/game/serial/2003/05/23/364,1053677811,12993,0,0.html 第15回　ゲーム＆ウォッチ(後編)　ゲーム人生回顧録 - 乱舞吉田]''. [[Famitsu]]. 14 April 2002.</ref> Stalfoses and Ghosts cannot be defeated and must be dodged and blocked with the shield respectively. The Goblin must be killed in order to complete the lower-screen labyrinth.<ref name=instructionmanual/> Once the Labyrinth is complete, stairs appear and the action shifts to the Dragon's Lair in the upper screen. Here Link battles a dragon on the right hand side of the screen while avoiding its fire and tail attacks. The left hand side of the screen displays the dungeon map and items such as the Tomahawk item<ref name=instructionmanual/>—unique to this game—that Link gains while fighting the dragon.<ref name=famitsu/> Upon defeating the dragon, the game starts again with quicker enemies and retaining the player's high score.<ref name="hyrule"/> This Game & Watch game also features a continue button that allows players to continue the game in the event of the player's death.<ref name=famitsu/>

===Plot===
Eight unruly [[dragon]]s are creating havoc in the world. After they kidnap [[Princess Zelda]], it is up to Link to defeat them and rescue the princess.<ref name="hyrule"/> The dragons have imprisoned Zelda behind a seal that requires all 8 pieces of the [[triforce]] to unlock. After defeating each dragon, Link gains one piece of the triforce.<ref name=instructionmanual/>

===Development and release===
The ''Zelda'' Game & Watch was developed by [[Gunpei Yokoi]] and [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Nintendo R&D1]].

===Reception===
''Zelda'' is thought to have pushed the limits of what is possible on the [[Game & Watch]] [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] format, though the gameplay is far simpler than the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] original.<ref name="hyrule"/> The game was noted in particular by ''[[Famitsu]]'' as having achieved the excitement and role-playing game-feel of the original series, but the game was criticized for being too easy if the player attained too many power-ups during play.<ref name=famitsu/> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' rated it Number 5 in their "Perfect Ten Games" for Game & Watch, noting that "it did capture the feel of the world it was played in".<ref>''Retrospection: Game & Watch - Perfect Ten Games: Zelda (Multi Screen)''. [[Retro Gamer]]. Issue 55. Pg 50. October 2008.</ref>

Today the game frequently fetches high prices on the secondary market with auction values ranging from £25 to £60.<ref name=retrogamer10/>

===Ports and re-releases===
In 1998, Toymax Inc. was licensed to make the [[Nintendo Mini Classics|Mini Classics series]], keychain-sized remakes of the Game & Watch series, one of them being ''Zelda''. It has a significantly smaller screen size. This keychain version, along with ''Oil Panic'' and ''Donkey Kong'', was only released in Europe. By early 2007, Stadlbauer and It's Outrageous! began distributing the Mini Classics version in select locations within the United States, using art from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures|Four Swords Adventures]]''.

In October 2002, Nintendo included a port of the game as a hidden unlockable extra in ''[[Game & Watch Gallery 4]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. This ''Zelda'' minigame is the most difficult to unlock, requiring the player to have beaten all other games (and to have earned all 160 stars).<ref>''[http://www.gamefaqs.com/gba/561568-game-and-watch-gallery-4/reviews/review-45199 "Game and Watch Gallery 4; Blast from the Past"]''. [[GameFAQs]]. Retrieved 13 December 2008.</ref> Due to limitations of the GBA hardware, the visuals were changed. To fit everything on-screen at once, the screen where the action is not taking place is reduced to about two-thirds of that of the original height.

''The Legend of Zelda''<ref name=manual>''The Legend of Zelda 8321''. Nelsonic. 1989.</ref> game watch is a multi-purpose [[Watch|wristwatch]] made by [[Nelsonic]] (re-released for European markets by Zeon in 1992) as part of their [[Nelsonic#Game Watches|Game Watch]] line.<ref name=superplay>Bielby, Matt, ed. ''No. 1 Nintendo Game Watches''. [[Super Play]]. Issue 2. Pg. 21. December 1992</ref> It tells the time and allows players to play a game. It runs on one battery, size #364 (black watch) or #392 (red watch). The game is based on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]'s original ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', and it was manufactured in black, red, white and pink colors.

===Gameplay===
The player controls [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] as he defeats enemies in caves to retrieve pieces of the [[Triforce]]. The game consists of four levels with four cavernous rooms each. In each cave, Link has to collect a boomerang and sword to defeat several enemies. Defeating all of the enemies in the cave grants Link a key to the next room which, on entering, causes Link to lose all of his weapons so that he can collect them again in the new cave. Once all enemies in the fourth cave are killed, the Dragon—the level's boss—appears. After Link defeats the Dragon, a Triforce fragment appears, giving him access to the next level. After collecting all four pieces of the Triforce, the game ends.<ref name=manual/>

===Plot===
Plot details for the game are scant to nonexistent. According to the manual, Link enters a cave where he is immediately attacked by Iron Balls, Ferocious bats, and fire breathing Dragons.<ref name=manual/> After obtaining weapons to defeat the enemies presented in each of the 4 caves per level, Link finds a key and fights the fire-breathing Dragon that serves as the boss of the level.<ref>Rice, Chris ed. ''Great Value Nintendo Merchandise - Lowest Prices!!'', SNESForce, issue 10, Pg.75, March 1994.</ref> When the Dragon is defeated he leaves Link with a piece of the Triforce. After progressing through all 4 levels, Link collects all 4 pieces of Triforce and wins.<ref name=manual/>

===Reception===
The game was well received by critics for its stylishness as an article of clothing, but the game was considered to have been largely unsuccessful in evoking the original NES title. While the game was praised for its ability to give the illusion of multiple screens, the gameplay was criticized for its simplicity and the game as a whole was found to be "unrelated to its namesake" and generally "very poor".<ref name=superplay/> Positive aspects touched on by reviewers included the game's relatively low price and its portability.<ref name=total/>

===Gameplay===
Played in the C2 mode on Barcode Battler II, ''Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce'' set allows the player to play as either Warrior or Wizard. After choosing the hero card (either "Link" or "Link(Magic)"), the player scans it into the Barcode Battler II where its stats are recorded and displayed on the LCD screen. For each battle, the players choose an enemy and swipe it in to fight against the hero. The battle is conducted based on an algorithm within the Barcode Battler, and the results of the fight are displayed in new character stats on the LCD screen. If the enemy is defeated, the enemy card is discarded and the next enemy card is swiped in. At any point between fights, the player may choose to swipe in and discard one of the ten item cards. Item cards provide a variety of benefits to the hero including boosting weapon stats, restoring life, and increasing defensive stats. Discarded item cards may be returned to the player from the discard pile upon defeating a Wizard enemy. After all other enemies are defeated, the player must swipe the "[[Ganon]]" card to fight the final boss. If Ganon is defeated, the player has won.<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090420002502/http://www.barcodebattler.co.uk/cards.php Nintendo Cards - Rules]''. BarcodeBattler.co.uk.

===Plot===
Ganon has transformed the sacred land into the "World of Darkness" and is now plotting to take over the "World of Light" (i.e. [[Hyrule]]). To achieve this end, the evil priest Agahnim strives to sacrifice the daughters of the seven sages to break the seal holding Ganon in check.

Link must venture through the Worlds of Light and Darkness to defeat Ganon. Along the way numerous puzzles and monsters await.<ref>K. Takiya.

===Reception===

Nintendo released the limited edition ''Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda'' unit in 2021 as part of their celebrations of the franchise's 35th anniversary. This unit featured a full-color pixel screen unlike prior Game & Watch systems. It came with 4 games, including fully playable [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES/Famicom]] versions of both Japanese and international of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' and ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'', the [[Game Boy]] version of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|Link's Awakening]]'' in various languages, and a new [[The Legend of Zelda|Zelda]]-themed variant of [[List of Game & Watch games#Vermin|Vermin]] in which the original character's head has been replaced with that of Link. It is unrelated to [[LCD games from The Legend of Zelda series#Game & Watch: Zelda|''Game & Watch: Zelda'']], and contains none of that game's content.

The size and shape of the external hardware is similar to the original [[List of Game & Watch games#Series|''Game & Watch'' ''Wide Screen'' series]], but with the addition of a cross-shaped [[d-pad]] like the one featured in the ''Game & Watch: Zelda''. This unit was released on November 12, 2021.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/products/detail/game-and-watch-the-legend-of-zelda |title=Game & Watch™: The Legend of Zelda™ System – Nintendo Product Details - Nintendo - Official Site |website=www.nintendo.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210615170416/https://www.nintendo.com/products/detail/game-and-watch-the-legend-of-zelda/ |archive-date=2021-06-15}} </ref><ref name="Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda Official Product Page">{{cite web|title=GAME & WATCH: THE LEGEND OF ZELDA|url=https://www.zelda.com//|access-date=22 June 2021|website=Official Zelda Product Page|archive-date=23 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220123052250/https://zelda.com/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Game & Watch has a very similar concept to the ''[[Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros.]]'', but it instead has 4 games and unlike the ''[[Mario]]'' one, it has a timer in addition to the clock feature, a hidden game difficulty for the Game and Watch Game, and a bears an emblem on the back of the handheld in the shape of the [[Triforce]].
