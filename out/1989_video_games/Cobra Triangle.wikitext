The game also includes [[Vehicular combat game|vehicular combat]], [[power-ups]] and is displayed from a 3D [[isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] perspective with [[sidescrolling|automatic scrolling]] that follows the player's movement. [[Tim and Chris Stamper|The Stamper brothers]] [[game design|designed]] the game and [[David Wise (composer)|David Wise]] wrote its soundtrack. ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' highly recommended the game and praised its [[video game graphics|graphics]] and [[gameplay]]. Later reviewers lauded its level diversity and noted its graphical similarities to previous Rare game ''[[R.C. Pro-Am]]''. ''[[IGN]]'' and ''[[GamesRadar]]'' ranked ''Cobra Triangle'' among their top NES games. The latter considered ''Cobra Triangle'' emblematic of the [[8-bit era|NES era]]'s aesthetic.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:CobraTriangleLevel7.png|left|thumb|Screenshot of gameplay]]
''Cobra Triangle'' is a [[racing game|racing]], [[vehicular combat game|vehicular combat video game]].<ref name="AllGame: rev"/> The player races a cannon-equipped speedboat against other watercraft. The 25 [[Level (video gaming)|stages]] of [[difficulty level|graduated difficulty]] vary in objectives: winning races, saving swimmers, and defusing bombs. Some levels end in [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fights]]. In races, the speedboat must avoid the riverbank and mid-river obstacles while outpacing a timer. The boat can attack other competitors, fly airborne via ramps, and pick up [[power-ups]] that upgrade its weapons and speed. In upstream races, the player navigates the speedboat to avoid logs and whirlpools. In bomb defusing activities, the player moves four protected bombs to a detonation site. In another mode, the player must destroy rogue boats before they drag swimmers to the edge of the lake. Any swimmers dragged halfway must be manually returned to the lake's center. The player loses a [[Health (gaming)|life]] if unsuccessful. ''Cobra Triangle'' is displayed from a 3D [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] perspective and its screen [[sidescrolling|automatically scrolls]] as the speedboat moves.<ref name=CVG/> {{clear left}}

In contemporaneous reviews, Jaz Rignall (''[[Computer and Video Games]]'') wrote in high praise of the "convincing" [[video game graphics|graphics]], smooth [[gameplay]], and "addictive" [[replay value]]. The magazine selected the game as a recommendation.<ref name=CVG/> Mark Caswell (''[[The Games Machine]]'') was most frustrated by the waterfall jumping sequences.<ref name=TGM/> In a retrospective review, Skyler Miller (''[[AllGame]]'') appreciated the diversity of levels.<ref name="AllGame: rev"/> Reviewers noted its graphical similarity to ''[[R.C.

In comparison, both games have vehicular boat combat while avoiding land. ''Cobra Triangle''{{'s}} camera view is isometric rather than [[overhead perspective|overhead]], and its gameplay is more focused on racing than combat.<ref name="AllGame: EC"/> ''[[IGN]]''<ref name="IGN: 100"/> and ''[[GamesRadar]]'' named ''Cobra Triangle'' among the top NES games.<ref name="GR: Best"/> The latter had "the most admiration" for ''Cobra Triangle'' out of all of Rare's catalog. They thought the game aged well and typified [[8-bit era|NES-era]] beauty in its isometric combat, upgrades, and game type variety.<ref name="GR: Best"/>
