{{nihongo foot|'''''Undeadline'''''|アンデッドライン|''Andeddorain''||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1989 [[vertically scrolling shooter]] [[video game]] developed and originally published by [[T&E Soft]] for the [[MSX2]] and [[MSX2+]] home computers. It was later ported to the [[X68000]] computer and [[Sega Mega Drive]], published by Palsoft, followed by digital re-releases for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Both the MSX2 and X68000  versions also received physical re-releases by Japanese retailer BEEP. It follows a group of characters in rescue of queen Althea from Zidane, a kingdom surrounded by barriers connected with the demon world, whose monsters have overflowed it. Controlling either a fighter, wizard, or ninja, the player can choose from six stages and play them in any order, fighting against waves of enemies and bosses, while defending or avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles.

''Undeadline'' was directed and designed by Tokihiro Naito, who previously worked on ''[[Hydlide]]'' and ''[[Hydlide 3]]'', with Tetsuya "Futaro" Yamamoto serving as main programmer. The soundtrack was composed by Kazunori Hasegawa. Due to T&E Soft liking to push its playtesters to the limits and as their skills improved naturally, it led to the designers increasing the difficulty to keep up with them, particularly paying attention to both enemy movement and spawn patterns. Because of its rarity, original copies of the MSX2 version commands high prices on the secondary game collecting market. The game received generally favorable reception from critics, most of which reviewed it as an [[Parallel importing in video games|import title]], although its difficulty has been criticized.

Queen Althea manages the kingdom, as his father became exhausted from battle and fell ill, but she is kidnapped by a creature from the demon world. Joined by the wizard Dino and the ninja Ruika, the fighter Leon stands up to rescue his sister.<ref name="Tech83"/><ref name="MSXClub77"/> Prior to starting, the player can configure the game's difficulty or activate rapid fire.<ref name="MBM87"/><ref name="MSXClub77"/> 

Controlling either the fighter, wizard, or ninja, the player can choose from the first six stages and play them in any order, fighting against an assortment of enemy waves, while defending or avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. There are seven stages in total, which include forests, ruins, and dungeons.<ref name="MSXMagJP69"/><ref name="MBM87"/><ref name="MSXClub77"/> The scenery is constantly scrolling and never stops moving until a [[miniboss]] or [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] is reached, which must be fought to progress further. Each character also possess their own defense methods, such as Leon being able to block projectiles with his shield.<ref name="MSXMagJP70"/> 

Scattered across every stage are tresure chests containing [[power-up]]s that open when shot,  ranging from beneficial or harmful items such as a speed boost or poison, to multiple types of weapons.<ref name="MSXMagJP70"/><ref name="MSXClub77"/> Picking up a new weapon grants its initial state and can be upgraded by picking the same weapon twice in a row. In the [[Sega Mega Drive]] version, they can be cycled through other weapons and power-ups by firing at them. After defeating a boss, the player can increase their overall status by granting [[experience point]]s (EXP) to any of the character's four characteristics: strength (ST), magic (MP), dexterity (DX), and agility (AG).<ref name="MSXMagJP70"/><ref name="MSXClub77"/> Diamonds can also be found within chests to gain additional experience points.<ref name="MSXClub77"/> Getting hit by an enemy or blocked by an obstacle and scrolled offscreen decreases the player's life. Once completely depleted, it will result in losing a live stock, as well as a penalty of decreasing the overall firepower of the character's currently equipped weapon to its original state and starting back at the beginning of a stage. The [[Game over|game is over]] once all lives are lost.
