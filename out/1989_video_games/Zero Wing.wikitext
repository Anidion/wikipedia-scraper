{{nihongo foot|'''''Zero Wing'''''|ゼロウィング|''Zero Wingu''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] [[side-scrolling shooter]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] developed by [[Toaplan]] and originally published in Japan by [[Namco]] and in North America by [[Williams Electronics]].<ref name="ATVGL:JaO1971-2005"/> Controlling the ZIG space fighter craft, players assume the role of protagonist Trent in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the alien cyborg CATS. It was the eighth shoot 'em up game from Toaplan, and their fourteenth video game overall.

Headed by development chief Toshiaki Ōta, ''Zero Wing'' was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan, initially starting as a project not intended for commercial release but to train new recruits before being ultimately released to the market. Although first launched in arcades, the game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[Video game#Platforms|platforms]], each one featuring several changes or additions compared with the original version.

''Zero Wing'' enjoyed a degree of success in arcades and its home [[Video game conversion|conversion]]s were met with mostly positive reception from critics. The European [[Mega Drive]] version later gained renewed popularity due to the "[[All your base are belong to us]]" [[internet meme]], which plays off the [[Engrish|badly translated]] introductory [[cutscene]]. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge. The Mega Drive version was later released in North America by independent publisher Retro-Bit in 2020.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Zero Wing.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]

''Zero Wing'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed [[side-scrolling shooter]] similar to ''[[Hellfire (video game)|Hellfire]]'', where players assume the role of Trent taking control of the ZIG space fighter craft through eight increasingly difficult levels, each with a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be fought before progressing any further, in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the alien cyborg CATS as the main objective.<ref name="ZWJPacflyer">''Zero Wing'' arcade flyer (Toaplan, JP)</ref><ref name="ZWSMDmanual">''Zero Wing'' instruction manual (Sega Mega Drive, EU)</ref><ref name="ZWPCECDROMm">''Zero Wing'' manual (PC Engine CD-ROM², JP)</ref><ref name="ZWhg101">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/zero-wing/|title=Zero Wing|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=12 December 2009|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref><ref name="ZWss">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/zerowing.html|title=ZERO WING|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-05-20|language=ja}}</ref> As far as side-scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until the stage boss is reached.<ref name="ZWSMDmanual"/><ref name="ZWhg101"/>

A unique gameplay feature is the "Seizer Beam" system;<ref name="ZWJPacflyer"/><ref name="ZWSMDmanual"/><ref name="ZWPCECDROMm"/><ref name="ZWhg101"/><ref name="ZWss"/> During gameplay, players can grab certain enemies and hold them as shield against enemy fire or launch them against enemies. There are three types of weapons in the game that can be switched between after destroying incoming carriers by picking up a color-changing [[Item (gaming)|item]] ranging from the "Red Cannon" shot, the "Blue Laser" and the "Green Homing" missiles.<ref name="ZWJPacflyer"/><ref name="ZWSMDmanual"/><ref name="ZWPCECDROMm"/><ref name="ZWhg101"/><ref name="ZWss"/> Each weapon can be upgraded by picking up an item of the same color.<ref name="ZWJPacflyer"/> Other items can also be grabbed along the way such as speed increasers, [[1UP]]s and a bomb module capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius that can also be triggered after taking enemy hits.<ref name="ZWJPacflyer"/><ref name="ZWSMDmanual"/><ref name="ZWPCECDROMm"/><ref name="ZWhg101"/><ref name="ZWss"/>

Depending on the settings in the arcade version, the title uses either a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying, or a [[respawn]] system where their ship immediately starts at the location where they died.<ref name="ZWhg101"/> Getting hit by enemy fire or colliding against solid stage obstacles will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's firepower and speed to his original state and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to [[Glossary of video game terms#Continue|continue]] playing. The game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous titles from Toaplan, with each one increasing the difficulty and enemies fire denser bullet patterns as well as spawning extra bullets when destroyed.

== Synopsis ==
The backstory of ''Zero Wing'' varies between each version,<ref name="ZWSMDmanual"/><ref name="ZWPCECDROMm"/><ref name="ZWhg101"/><ref name="ZWss"/> but the plot within the game itself remains consistent. Set in 2101, the game follows the signing of a peace treaty between the [[United Nations]] (also translated as the [[Milky Way]] Federation) and CATS, an alien cyborg who is described either as a dictator or a [[space pirate]] depending on the translation. However, CATS breaks the covenant and takes control of the Japanese/Federation space colonies. The protagonist Trent leads a ZIG space craft, which had managed to escape from the mothership destroyed by CATS, with the aim to defeat enemy forces, avenge the mothership and its crew and liberate the Earth.

== Development ==
''Zero Wing'' was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan, with members of the development staff recounting its history through various Japanese publications. Toshiaki Ōta was at the helm as development chief and also served as [[Video game programmer|programmer]] alongside Hiroaki Furukawa and [[Tatsuya Uemura]].<ref name="VGMDB">{{cite web|url=https://vgmdb.net/album/554|title=PCCB-00001 &#124; Zero Wing|work=vgmdb.net|publisher=VGMdb|access-date=2020-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200520020705/https://vgmdb.net/album/554|archive-date=2020-05-20|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplanmusic/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022183049/http://shmuplations.com/toaplanmusic/|date=2019-10-22}}).</ref><ref name="ZWOS">{{cite video game|title=Zero Wing|developer=[[Toaplan]]|publisher=[[Sega]]|date=July 1992|platform=[[Sega Mega Drive]]|level=Zero Wing Original Staff}}</ref> Uemura also acted as [[Video game composer|composer]] along with Masahiro Yuge and Toshiaki Tomizawa.<ref name="VGMDB"/><ref name="ZWOS"/><ref name="PSGv10">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=東亜プランインタビュー|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=F.S.G Club|date=September 1989|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name="STGv4b">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Yūsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=東亜プラン特集 - 元・東亜プラン 開発者インタビュー: 弓削雅稔|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=41–48|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023744/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref> [[Video game artist|Artist]]s Miho Hayashi, Naoki Ogiwara and Shintarō Nakaoka created the artwork while Sanae Nitō and Yuko Tataka served as [[character designer]]s.<ref name="ZWOS"/><ref name="B!MD14">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/beep-megadrive-1990-11/page/n88/mode/1up|title=当世ゲーム業界 働く女性事情 - ワーキング・ガール: 田高祐子•二藤早苗 (東亜プラン) Character Designer|magazine=[[Gemaga|Beep!

Uemura stated that ''Zero Wing'' originally started as a project not intended for commercial launch to train new recruits at Toaplan, handling training for new hires while using his work and engine from ''Hellfire'' before ultimately deciding with releasing the game to the market, which made it a more practical learning experience for the new developers.<ref name="VGMDB"/><ref name="TFf25v9">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|date=June 2009|pages=1–70|lang=ja}} ([https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201010170328/https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332|date=2020-10-10}}).</ref><ref name="TSCb">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル 特設ページ|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-05-19|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name="STGv4a">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Yūsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=東亜プラン特集 - 元・東亜プラン 開発者インタビュー: 上村建也|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=33–40|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023755/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref><ref name="DOG">{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/games/58480/toaplan-the-rise-and-fall-of-japans-greatest-shooting-game-company|title=Toaplan: the rise and fall of Japan's greatest shooting game company|work=[[Den of Geek]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|date=21 June 2018|access-date=2020-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621073806/http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/games/58480/toaplan-the-rise-and-fall-of-japans-greatest-shooting-game-company|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Wireframe13">{{cite magazine|url=https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/issues/13|title=Interface - Developer Profile / Toaplan|magazine=[[Raspberry Pi Foundation#Magazine|Wireframe]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Raspberry Pi Foundation]]|date=May 9, 2019|pages=50–51}}</ref> However, Uemura felt that both stage design and characters were "cobbled together", leading the game's world being "kind of a mess" and he also stated the project turned into a "[[battle royal]]e", as staff from both ''Hellfire'' and ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]'' were mixed with the new recruits.<ref name="VGMDB"/><ref name="TSCb"/> Sound also proved to be very divisive as Uemura, Yuge and Tomizawa wrote several songs for the game with their own individual styles, though Uemura claimed this was due to dividing the work, while Yuge stated he would go to rest and drink after being stuck when composing for the title during work hours.<ref name="VGMDB"/><ref name="PSGv10"/><ref name="STGv4b"/><ref name="TSCb"/> Due to being a training project, Uemura stated the team had freedom to "just fool around" and several features were integrated into the title such as warps, which was taken from ''[[Slap Fight]]''.<ref name="TSCb"/> Uemura also revealed that the reason for enemies spawning suicide bullets during loops of higher difficulty was in response to hardware limitations regarding [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s.<ref name="TSCb"/> Both the single-player and co-op versions were also planned from the beginning of development due to pressure to make two-player games at the time.<ref name="TSCb"/> The alien Pipiru was designed by Ogiwara, though Uemura claimed such character was not planned.<ref name="TSCb"/>
