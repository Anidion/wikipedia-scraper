'''''Pipe Mania''''' is a [[puzzle video game]] developed by [[The Assembly Line]] for the [[Amiga]] and published in 1989. It was ported to several other platforms by [[LucasArts|Lucasfilm Games]] as '''''Pipe Dream'''''; the company distributed the game in the US. The player must connect randomly appearing pieces of pipe on a grid to a given length within a limited time.

The Windows version of the game was included in the ''[[Microsoft Entertainment Pack|MS Windows Entertainment Pack]]''. In 1990, it was released as an [[arcade game]] by Japanese manufacturer Video System Co. Ltd., though with slightly altered gameplay, giving the player the task to connect a source and drain with the random pipe pieces.

Long after its initial release, the ''Pipe Mania'' concept re-emerged as a [[minigame]] representing hacking or security system bypassing in larger video games.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Pipedream.png|thumb|left|250px|Windows 3.x version]]
The game is played on a grid of squares, one of which is marked as an entry point for a flow of green slime, referred to in-game as "flooz" or "goo" depending on the version. A column of five pipe sections is displayed to one side as a dispenser. When the player clicks on an empty square, the bottommost piece in the dispenser is placed there and a new piece drops in from the top. Pieces cannot be rotated or flipped and must be used in their original orientation. The objective is to form an unbroken pipeline through which the flooz can flow, starting from the entry point and extending for at least a specified minimum number of squares.

The flooz begins to flow after a set time delay, and continues to do so until it reaches a pipe-end that is either open or blocked by a square/playfield edge. If the pipeline has reached or exceeded the minimum required length, the player advances to the next level; if not, the game ends.

If the flooz has not yet entered a pipe section, the player can click on it to replace it with the next one in the dispenser. However, doing so carries a score penalty and causes a short delay before the next piece can be laid.

Later levels introduce added complications, such as:
* Higher minimum pipeline lengths and shorter delays before the flooz starts to flow.
* Higher flow speeds.
* Obstacles or pipe sections already on the field, which cannot be replaced.
* An end piece into which the flooz must be routed. Failing to do so ends the game, even if the length requirement has been met.
* Openings at opposite edges of the grid, allowing the flooz to wrap around from one to the other.
* Reservoirs that take a few seconds to fill once the flooz enters them, giving the player extra time to place pipes.
* One-way pipe sections that allow flow only in the indicated direction.

The player scores points for every pipe section the flooz crosses, and loses points at the end of each level for any unused sections on the field. Bonus points can be scored for the following:
* Using more than the minimum number of pipe sections.
* Routing the flooz to cross itself in a four-way intersection. Doing so five times in a single level awards a large bonus.
* Filling reservoirs.
* Routing the flooz through pre-placed bonus pipes.

A bonus round is played after every fourth level, in which the player is presented with a grid of pipe sections that has one empty space. Clicking on a piece adjacent to this space will cause it to slide over; the goal is to build as long a pipeline as possible, scoring points for each section used. A password is given after each bonus round, allowing the player to start a game at the level immediately following it.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed the arcade version of ''Pipe Mania'' on their November 1, 1990 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=391|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 November 1990|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Many clones of ''Pipe Mania'' have been produced, under titles such as ''Wallpipe'', ''Oilcap'', ''Oilcap Pro'', ''MacPipes'', ''Pipe Master'', ''Pipeworks'', ''DragonSnot'', ''PipeNightDreams'', and ''Fun2Link''. Many [[Nokia]] [[cell phones]] come with a free version of the game called ''Canal Control''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

A version with 3D graphics was released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 2000, titled ''Pipe Dreams 3D'' in the US and ''Pipe Mania 3D'' in the UK. <!-- Please do not edit this. The title of this particular game is Pipe Dreams 3D, not Pipe Dream 3D. -->

In September 2008, [[Empire Interactive]] released a remake of ''Pipe Mania'' for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Nintendo DS]], and [[PlayStation Portable]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pipemaniagame.com/en/ |title=Pipe Mania 2008 remake website |publisher=[[Empire Interactive]] |date=2008-09-03 |access-date=2008-09-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930095040/http://www.pipemaniagame.com/en/ |archive-date=2008-09-30}}</ref> It was developed by [[Razorworks]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Games |url=http://www.razorworks.com/games.html |website=[[Razorworks]] |publisher=[[Empire Interactive]] |access-date=23 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531043244/http://www.razorworks.com/games.html |archive-date=31 May 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Within ''[[BioShock]]'', a variation of the game exists as a means of "[[hacker (computer security)|hacking]]" vending machines, robots and cameras.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360reviews/fr/bioshockrev.htm |title=''BioShock'' Review (X360) at Xbox.about.com |last=Qualls |first=Eric |publisher=[[About.com]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326140334/http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360reviews/fr/bioshockrev.htm |archive-date=2013-03-26 |access-date=2007-11-04}}</ref> ''[[Alien Swarm]]'', ''[[Saints Row IV]]'' and ''[[Warframe]]'' also use ''Pipe Dream''-like minigames to represent hacking tasks.

''Pipe Dream'' like hacking is a main mechanic of ''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]'', with players solving puzzles in 3d space as a means of hacking doors and electronics in VR.

A [[Nintendo eShop]]-exclusive game on [[Nintendo 3DS]] titled ''[[Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move]]'' uses a similar gameplay in which the player must places tiles to create a possible road for the "Mini Mario" toy to reach the level's goal.

The [[North Korea]]n game ''Railway Assemblage'' ([[Hangul|Chosongul]]: 렬차길 맞추기 [[Hanja]]: 列車길 맞추기), sponsored by North Korean propaganda regime [[Uriminzokkiri]] ([[Hangul|Chosongul]]:우리민족끼리) and released on December 9, 2006, includes a simplified version of ''Pipe Mania''. The game involves joining together sections of railway in order to build a fast railroad track from [[South Korea]] to [[North Korea]], before the [[KTX]]-shaped [[train]] appears on the screen.
