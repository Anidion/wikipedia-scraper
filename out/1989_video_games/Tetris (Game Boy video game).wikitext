{{nihongo foot|'''''Tetris'''''|テトリス|Tetorisu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[puzzle video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy]] in 1989. It is a portable version of [[Alexey Pajitnov]]'s original ''[[Tetris]]'' and it was bundled with the North American and European releases of the Game Boy itself. It is the first game to have been compatible with the [[Game Link Cable]], a pack-in accessory that allows two Game Boy consoles to link for multiplayer purposes. A [[Video game remaster|remaster]], '''''Tetris DX''''', was released on the [[Game Boy Color]] in 1998. A [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Virtual Console]] version of ''Tetris'' was released in December 2011, lacking multiplayer functionality. The game was released on the [[Nintendo Switch Online]] service in February 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Plant |first=Logan |date=2023-02-08 |title=Nintendo Switch Online Adding Game Boy and Game Boy Advance Games |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-games |access-date=2023-02-09 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
[[File:GB Tetris.png|frame|left|''Tetris'' gameplay]]
[[File:Tetris-gravity-simple.svg|left|thumb|Naïve gravity in action]]

The Game Boy version of ''Tetris'' plays identically to versions on other platforms. A [[pseudorandom]] sequence of [[tetromino]] shapes, composed of four square blocks each, fall down the playing field, which is 10 blocks wide by 18 blocks high. The object of the game is to manipulate the tetrominoes by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90-degree units with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When one or more such lines are created, they disappear, and the blocks above (if any) move down by the number of lines cleared. As in most standard versions of ''Tetris'', blocks do not automatically fall into open gaps when lines are cleared.

As the game progresses, the tetrominoes fall faster. The game ends when at least part of a tetromino extends beyond the top of the playfield when setting in place. The player can normally see which block will appear next in a window off to the side of the playing field, but this feature can be toggled during the game.<ref name="NinDB">{{cite web|title=Tetris|url=http://www.nindb.net/game/tetris.html|access-date=March 14, 2008|work=NinDB}}</ref> Points are awarded based on the current level and number of lines cleared. The level increases each time the player clears ten lines, as does the speed of falling tetrominoes.<ref name="NinDB" /> The player may adjust the difficulty before beginning a game by selecting a starting level or choosing to pre-fill the play area with a given number of lines of randomly placed blocks. After completing a particular height, the player is treated to a cutscene of a rocket of various types being launched, eventually capping off with Russians dancing and the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran shuttle]] being launched.

This version of ''Tetris'' includes a two-player mode, in which each player's objective is to remain in play for longer than their opponent. Each player plays with a separate Game Boy and ''Tetris'' [[Game Boy Game Pak|Game Pak]], with the two consoles connected via the [[Game Link Cable]]. When a player scores a Double, Triple, or Tetris, incomplete rows of blocks are added to the bottom of the opponent's stack, causing it to rise.

== Development ==
[[File:Alexey Pajitnov January 2008 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|[[Alexey Pajitnov]], the designer of the original ''Tetris'', called the Game Boy version his favorite.]]
''Tetris'' was first created in 1985<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tetris {{!}} video game {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tetris |access-date=2023-04-19 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> by [[Alexey Pajitnov]]. In 1988, Pajitnov teamed with fellow [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] researchers  Dmitry Pavlovsky, and [[Vadim Gerasimov]] to create a new two-player version of ''Tetris'' that ran on PCs.<ref name="vadim">{{cite web|last=Gerasimov|first=Vadim|url=http://vadim.oversigma.com/Tetris.htm|title=Original Tetris: Story and Download|work=vadim.oversigma.com|access-date=June 10, 2007}}</ref> The game was soon licensed by Andromeda Software executive Robert Stein, who sublicensed the game to multiple publishers in different territories. In 1988, [[Henk Rogers]] of [[Bullet-Proof Software]] noticed the US home computer version at the [[Las Vegas]] [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in a [[Spectrum HoloByte]] booth. Finding himself hooked to the game, he pursued the rights to publish ''Tetris'' in Japan, and secured licenses from both Spectrum HoloByte, who held the North American computer license, and [[Atari Games]], which had produced the American arcade version under a sublicense from [[Mirrorsoft]], which had the rights for the European computer market. Knowing Nintendo was planning to release the Game Boy, Rogers approached [[Nintendo of America]] president [[Minoru Arakawa]] to suggest ''Tetris'' as the perfect bundled [[launch game]]. Arakawa questioned the idea, having planned to bundle ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', but Rogers countered by stating that though a ''Mario'' game would promote the Game Boy to young boys, ''Tetris'' would promote it to everyone.<ref name="IGNvid">{{cite web |url=http://stars.ign.com/dor/objects/919431/Alexey-Pajitnov/videos/tetris_spc_e3_01.html |title=Alexey Pajitnov Stars Interview – Video Interview: Alexey Pajitnov Pt. 1 |date=June 13, 2009 |author=Staff |website=IGN |access-date=June 13, 2009}}</ref> Rogers was told to pursue the rights; he approached Stein to seek rights for it to be distributed with the Game Boy.<ref name="highscore">{{cite book |title=High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Video Games |first1=Rusel |last1=DeMaria |last2=Wilson|first2= Johnny L.|edition=2 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-223172-6}}</ref>

However, after several months passed, Stein had not signed to contract for the rights for the Game Boy, and Rogers learned that another person had approached Nintendo with the idea of a Game Boy ''Tetris''. Requesting more time from Arakawa, he traveled to Moscow to speak with the [[Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations]]'s bureau for computer hardware and software export, called [[Elektronorgtechnica]] or ELORG, and Pajitnov. During this time, Nintendo approached Spectrum HoloByte on the prospect of a Game Boy ''Tetris'', causing Mirrorsoft to send a representative, [[Kevin Maxwell]], to Moscow to secure rights for the Game Boy version.<ref name="highscore" /> Meanwhile, Rogers negotiated for the rights for ''Tetris'' on the Game Boy, noting in a later interview that the government officials did not understand the concept of [[intellectual property]], and were looking for greater payment than Rogers or Nintendo could afford.<ref name="IGNvid" /> However, it was revealed that the ''Tetris'' property had not actually been licensed to anyone because Stein had secured the rights from Pajitnov directly and not from the Russian authority.<ref>{{cite book |title=Invisible Engines: How Software Platforms Drive Innovation and Transform Industries |last1=Evans |first1=David Sparks |first2=Andrei|last2=Hagiu|first3=Richard|last3=Schmalensee|edition=Illustrated |publisher=MIT Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-262-05085-4}}</ref> Russia sent a fax to Maxwell in England with 48 hours to respond, but due to being in Russia at the time Maxwell did not receive the fax, and the handheld rights were given to Rogers. Rogers licensed the handheld rights to Nintendo. During this time Rogers discovered that the home console rights were actually not properly licensed, and in March 1989, Arakawa, and Nintendo vice president [[Howard Lincoln]], working with Rogers, secured exclusive rights for console distribution of ''Tetris''.<ref name="highscore" /> However, ''Tetris''{{'}}s production was delayed due to an ongoing legal battle with Atari Games over their home publishing subsidiary [[Tengen (company)|Tengen's]] [[Tetris (Atari video game)|version of ''Tetris'' for the NES]] and the game was released in Japan two months after the Game Boy's release there.<ref name="gameover">{{cite book |last1=Sheff |first1=David |author-link=David Sheff |first2=Andy|last2=Eddy|year=1993 |title=[[Game Over: How Nintendo Zapped an American Industry, Captured Your Dollars, and Enslaved Your Children|Game Over: How Nintendo Conquered the World]] |publisher=[[Random House|Random House, Inc.

=== Music ===
The main soundtrack for ''Tetris'' was created by Nintendo's accomplished composer [[Hirokazu Tanaka]].<ref name="composer">{{cite web |url=http://www.hirokazutanaka.com/works/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119020328/http://www.hirokazutanaka.com/works/ |title=Works |work=Sporadic Vacuum |publisher=[[Hirokazu Tanaka]] |access-date=December 8, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-date=January 19, 2011}}</ref> The player can select one of three types of background music during the game or play with sound effects only. Two of the songs are arrangements of works from other composers: "Type A" is based on the Russian folk song "[[Korobeiniki]]" (also known as "[[Korobushka]]"), and "Type C" is an arranged version of "[[French Suites, BWV 812-817|French Suite No. 3 in B minor, BWV 814: Menuet]]" (transposed to F♯ minor) by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chicago.timeout.com/articles/opera-classical/68670/video-game-music-composers |title=Ode to joysticks |first=Brent |last=DiCrescenzo |date=November 13–19, 2008 |work=[[Time Out Chicago]]: Opera & Classical |access-date=December 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/tanaka/biography.shtml |title=Hirokazu Tanaka Biography |first=Chris |last=Greening |publisher=Square Enix Music Online |access-date=December 20, 2010}}</ref> In an early version that was only released in Japan with an estimated 25,000 copies sold, the "Type A" song is "Minuet".<ref>{{cite web|title=Tetris (Game Boy)|url=https://tcrf.net/Tetris_(Game_Boy)|access-date=February 13, 2019|publisher=[[The Cutting Room Floor (website)|The Cutting Room Floor]]}}</ref> The compositions "Type A" and "Type B" can be unlocked in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, where "Type A" can be played on the stage, "''Luigi's Mansion''" in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]'' and ''[[Super smash bros for wii u|for Wii U]],'' and "Type B" can be played on the stage, "''Luigi's Mansion''" in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]'', and "''Wuhu Island''" in ''[[Super smash bros for wii u|for Wii U]],'' both can be played on any miscellaneous Nintendo series stage in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]''.

The victory fanfares played after completing levels are different arrangements of "[[Trepak (The Nutcracker)|Trepak]]", from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s [[ballet]] ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.

== Re-release ==
=== ''Tetris DX'' ===
'''''Tetris DX''''' is a [[Game Boy Color]] game that is backward compatible with the original Game Boy. It was developed by Nintendo and released in Japan on October 21, 1998, in North America on November 18, 1998, and in Europe and Australia in 1999. ''Tetris DX'' features battery-saved high scores and three player profiles. It has a new single-player mode against the CPU and also features two new modes of play. In "Ultra Mode", players must accumulate as many points as possible within a three-minute time period. In "40 Lines", players are timed on how quickly they can clear 40 lines of play. New music themes were added.
