==Gameplay==
The player assumes the role of a Western sheriff, who engages in gunfights in varied locations throughout the [[American frontier|American Old West]]. The game requires quick reactions, as the player has only a moment to shoot an enemy gunslinger after they appear to avoid being shot and losing a [[Health (gaming)|health point]]. The player may shoot bombs hidden among the level scenery, clearing the screen of enemies and replenishing the player's life.  The player must also take care not to shoot innocent civilians, or gunmen who surrender, either of which will result in lost health. The end of each round features a [[boss battle]] with a bandit leader.
