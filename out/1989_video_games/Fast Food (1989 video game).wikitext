'''''Fast Food''''' (sometimes referred to as '''''Fast Food Dizzy''''')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue123/Pages/SinclairUser12300015.jpg |title = Sinclair User}}</ref> is the title of two slightly different maze video games in the vein of ''[[Pac-Man]]''. Both feature [[Dizzy (series)|Dizzy]] an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] egg designed by the British-born [[Oliver Twins]]. The game was originally released in April 1989<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olivertwins.com/FastFood |title=Fast Food |website=The Oliver Twins |access-date=8 September 2018 |archive-date=2 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802235033/http://www.olivertwins.com/FastFood |url-status=dead}}</ref> and published by [[Codemasters]]. It was the third title to feature Dizzy.

The 8-bit versions of the game were released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] with mazes of abstract design. The 16-bit versions released for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[DOS]] have environments that are identifiable as real-world locations such as gardens, harbours, and graveyards.

==Gameplay==
Dizzy's aim in each maze is to gather all of the food (burgers, pizzas, etc.): some of the food also moves around the maze, either evading Dizzy or trying to meet him. Dizzy is pursued by four mushroom-like monsters: Bonzo, Wizza, Pippa, and Fido. Power-ups and breakable walls add to the complexity of the game.

==Development==

The game was playable within three days of work; the developers only took two more weeks to finalize the graphics, interface and music.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The game was originally to be a marketing tool for the [[Happy Eater]] chain of restaurants, but this idea was dropped during development and Dizzy was added to the game.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/ME0wVsGExSM Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160316085337/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME0wVsGExSM Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite AV media | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME0wVsGExSM | title = Let's Play Fast Food starring Dizzy by The Oliver Twins March 1989 | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

==Legacy==
A shortened, altered version of the game, entitled Easter Eggstravaganza Dizzy, was made available on ''[[Amiga Action]]'' and ''[[ST Action]]'' coverdiscs in May 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_117_pages |title = Amiga Action 44 (May 1993) Page scans - Amiga Magazine Rack}}</ref> Completion of this game would give players a code which would allow them to enter a competition in the magazine.

In November 2020, a completely new version of ''Fast Food'' (now titled ''Fast Food Dizzy'') was released for the [[Nintendo Switch]]. It was developed and published by the Oliver Twins on the FUZE program for the console.
