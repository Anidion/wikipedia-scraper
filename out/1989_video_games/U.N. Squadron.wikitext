'''''U.N. Squadron'''''  is a 1989 [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|side-scrolling shooting game]] released by [[Capcom]] for the [[CP System|CPS]] [[arcade game|arcade]] hardware and for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game was released in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''''Area 88'''''|エリア88|Eria Hachi-Jū-Hachi|lead=yes}},<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=8265|title=エリア88 [スーパーファミコン] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630112711/https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=8265|archive-date=2018-06-30|url-status=live}}</ref> and is based on the [[manga]] series of the [[Area 88|same name]], featuring the same main characters. Their mission is to stop a terrorist group known as Project 4. It was followed by a [[spiritual successor]] ''[[Carrier Air Wing (video game)|Carrier Air Wing]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:UN Squadron (character selection).png|thumb|left|Pilot selection screen in ''U.N. Squadron'']]

The game is a typical [[side scrolling]] shooter, going against the trend of other [[Capcom]] shooters, such as ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'' and ''[[1943: The Battle of Midway]]'', which are vertically scrolling shooters. Like other [[Capcom]] shooters, the player has an energy bar that is consumed over the course of a single life as the player sustains damage. This trait is highly uncommon among other comparable arcade-style shooters which normally use a system of reserve lives, where one of which is lost upon a single enemy hit. Before entering a level, the player can purchase special weapons or added defenses in the shop. The player earns money to buy weapons by destroying enemy planes and vehicles during levels and, when the level is finished, any unused weapons are converted back into money.

The player can choose between three mercenary pilots: Shin Kazama, Mickey Simon, and Greg Gates.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shintani |first=Kaoru |author-link=Kaoru Shintani |url=https://archive.org/details/area-88-manual-scan-jp-sfc-snes/ |title=U.N.

In the Super NES version, each pilot can use a range of planes. All pilots start out with $3000 and the basic F8 Crusader, and can buy other aircraft and weapons as they progress.

== Development ==
Capcom director [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] commented that the game was part of a broader strategy of Capcom at the time to appeal to a wider audience by using established characters from other media, as their original characters could be too niche.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|title=Developer Interview Capcom Developer: Yoshiaki Okamoto, Noritaka Funamizu|journal=[[Gamest]]|publisher=[[Shinseisha]] Ltd.|issue=38|pages=10–29}} [http://shmuplations.com/cps1/ (Translation)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193652/http://shmuplations.com/cps1/|date=2017-05-31}}</ref> In addition to ''Area 88'', he cited games based on ''[[Willow (NES)|Willow]]'' and ''[[Dynasty Wars|Tenchi wo Kurau]]'' as part of this strategy.<ref name=":3" />
