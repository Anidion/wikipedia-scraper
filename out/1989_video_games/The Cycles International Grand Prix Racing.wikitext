'''''The Cycles: International Grand Prix Racing''''' is a [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] [[computer game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Distinctive Software]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]. It has similarities to ''[[Grand Prix Circuit (game)|Grand Prix Circuit]]'', except it is a [[motorcycle]] [[Racing video game|racing sim]]. The game includes all the tracks of [[1989 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season]]. Laguna Seca and Goiania circuits are not available when you choose 125cc bike.

It was released for the [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]].

==Gameplay==
More like a simulation than an [[arcade game]], unlike [[Sega]]'s ''[[Hang-On]]'' and ''[[Super Hang-On]]'', the player has no time limit to clear races. If the player crashes, they are out of the race. To win each race, the player must get through the finish lines. The player can change the number of laps for a race.

The game has several modes which it can be played in:

*Championship: Choose a bike, not a track. If the player is qualified for race, they can proceed to it.
*Practice: The player chooses their bike and track.
*Single Race: Player chooses a bike and track. If the player is qualified for race, they can proceed to it.
