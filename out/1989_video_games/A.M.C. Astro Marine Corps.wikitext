==Gameplay==
The player controls a member of the eponymous Astro Marine Corps, on a mission to stop the Deathbringers, a conglomerate of multiple alien criminals, from launching a campaign to conquer the galaxy. To fulfill his mission, the marine must run from left to right, jumping over obstacles and shooting aliens that try to kill him. Colliding with the aliens or their shots will lower the marine's health bar, or in the case of some enemies even kill him outright, making him lose one of his four lives. From time to time, boxes containing power ups or booby traps drop from the sky, and the marine has to shoot them to reveal their contents. Power ups include health refills, grenades and various alternate shot types such as a flame thrower or a spread shot. The marine can also obtain temporary invulnerability, although it doesn't work with enemies that can kill him instantly.

The game is divided in two phases. Each phase must be completed in a limited amount of time, which is extended upon reaching various checkpoints. In the first phase, the marine has to reach the Deathbringers' ship landed on planet Dendar and hijack it. At the end of the phase, a boss alien, the Krauer, must be defeated. In the second phase, the marine must fight through the Deathbringers' home planet and destroy their leader, the Great Alien King, to end the invasion.
