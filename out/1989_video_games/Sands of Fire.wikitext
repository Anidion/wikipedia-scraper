'''''Sands of Fire''''' is a 1989 video game published by [[Three-Sixty Pacific]].

==Gameplay==
''Sands of Fire'' is a game in which a [[tank]] simulation takes place during [[World War II]] in [[North Africa]].<ref name="CGW74"/>

==Reception==
Bob Proctor reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Frankly, ''Sands of Fire'' is a competent program that does not break any new ground in computer gaming. Still, graphics and sound are above average and, though it is not an overly accurate simulation, it has enough realistic "feel" to satisfy many of us. Further, it is very easy to play and successfully recreates some of the feel of the frenzied tank battles around Tobruk."<ref name="CGW74">{{cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |title=At Sea in the Desert: Three-Sixty's Sands of Fire |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September 1990 |volume=1 |issue=74 |pages=12â€“13}}</ref>
