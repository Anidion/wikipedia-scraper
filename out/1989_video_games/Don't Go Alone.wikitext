==Reception==
[[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "the game is mainly an exercise in monster-mash, although on a more limited scale than most CRPG's. The simple interface, very nice auto-mapping, balanced combat, interesting monster graphics, formula components, and unique use of fear are all pluses, but these are overshadowed by the large minus of having little substantive to do in the game. Essentially, this game is best for those with little or no experience with CRPG's."<ref name="CGW65">{{cite magazine |author=Scorpia |authorlink=Scorpia (journalist) |title="Don't Go Alone": Accolade's Terrifying New Adventure |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=November 1989 |volume=1 |issue=65 |pages=18, 20}}</ref>
