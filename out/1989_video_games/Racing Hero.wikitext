'''''Racing Hero''''' is a 1989 [[arcade racing game]] from [[Sega]] which runs on the [[Sega X Board]] hardware (the same hardware used for games such as ''[[After Burner]]'' and ''[[Power Drift]]''). In ''Racing Hero'', the player takes part in an international race aboard a motorcycle and races against time and other vehicles. It draws much inspiration from Sega's successful ''[[Hang-On]]'' and ''[[Out Run]]'' series.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Gameplay==
The player controls a motorcycle from behind the rider's own perspective, and must reach the checkpoints in each stage before time runs out. The player must also deal with other vehicles and obstacles, where collisions will result in an explosion and loss of time. The race starts in [[Australia]] and once the player reaches the end of each stage, they are taken to a [[fork (intersection)|fork in the road]] screen where they can choose the next country they wish to race in.

==Release==
The game was exhibited at Japan's AOU show in February 1990.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Overseas Readers Column: Many Videos Unveiled At AOU Expo '90 Chiba |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=377 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=1 April 1990 |page=26 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19900401p.pdf#page=14}}</ref>
