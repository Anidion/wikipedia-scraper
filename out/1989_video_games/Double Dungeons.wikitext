==Gameplay==
In the game, players select from 22 levels, earning gold and experience by killing enemies. The last level is not accessible until the player beats the others. Gold can be used to buy weapons, armors and items at a shop, or rest at an inn, while the experience points help to raise the player's level.

The player(s) cannot die, but are sent back to the start of the dungeon if they lose in battle. The two-player split-screen mode is co-op.

== Reception ==
The Virtual Console release received poor scores by [[IGN]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Lucas M.|title=Double Dungeons Review|url=http://ign.com/articles/2007/03/14/double-dungeons-review|website=IGN|accessdate=15 October 2017|date=13 March 2007}}</ref> and [[Nintendo Life]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dillard|first=Corbie|title=Review: Double Dungeons (Virtual Console / TurboGrafx-16)|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2007/03/double_dungeons_virtual_console|website=Nintendo Life|accessdate=15 October 2017|date=10 March 2007}}</ref>
