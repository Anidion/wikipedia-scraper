{{nihongo|'''''Screw Style'''''|ねじ式|Nejishiki|lead=yes}} is a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[manga]] written and illustrated by essayist and manga artist [[Yoshiharu Tsuge]]. ''Screw Style'' follows of the story of an unnamed boy who goes around several places in war-torn Japan in order to find a doctor who can fix his pierced artery.

The manga was first published in the manga anthology magazine ''[[Garo (magazine)|Garo]]'' in 1968 to popularity among Japanese youth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thecribsheet-isabelinho.blogspot.in/2008/12/yoshiharu-tsuges-nejishiki.html|title=Yoshiharu Tsuge's Nejishiki|website=thecribsheet-isabelinho.blogspot.in|date=12 December 2008|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Dreamland Japan: Writings on Modern Manga|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|publisher=Stone Bridge Press, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-1933330952|pages=201–202}}</ref> The manga has been adapted into a video game and a live action film.

== Plot ==
A boy arriving ashore in war-torn Japan is bitten by a jellyfish that pierces his artery. He enters a nearby village and goes around looking for a doctor, but finds none. The boy then proceeds to follow a road of railway tracks in hope that it will lead him to the next village, only to get onto a train that brings him back to the village he first entered.

He then decides to search the village again, this time properly and encounters an old woman who tells him that the doctor he desires is in a nearby factory, but the boy goes to a female [[gynecologist]] who resides in a [[bunker]] instead. He has sex with the gynecologist before getting his pierced artery fixed with a safety valve and wrench. The manga ends with the boy sailing away in a motorboat.

== Style and themes ==
''Screw Style'' does not have a conventional plot, and like many of Tsuge's works for Garo, it has a surreal, ambiguous quality in the progress of the narrative and the artwork. All characters except the main character are drawn as if they are static.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apjjf.org/2012/10/35/Tom-Gill/3815/article.html|title=The Incident at Nishibeta Village: A Classic Manga by Tsuge Yoshiharu from the Garo Years {{!}} The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus|last=Journal|first=The Asia Pacific|website=apjjf.org|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://archives.tcj.com/sp2005/tsuge.html|title=The Comics Journal: Interviews|date=2012-02-02|newspaper=archive.li|access-date=2017-01-24|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120202170842/http://archives.tcj.com/sp2005/tsuge.html|archive-date=2012-02-02}}</ref>

There have been various interpretations of the themes of the manga, with various critics arguing the manga is about birth and death, or [[existential nihilism]].
