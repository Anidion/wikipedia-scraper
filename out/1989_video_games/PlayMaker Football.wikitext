'''''PlayMaker Football''''' is an [[American football]] [[simulation]] produced by PlayMaker Software. The first version of the game was released in 1989 by [[Broderbund]] for the [[Macintosh]]. It has since been ported to the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Palm OS]]. The most recent versions are 2.4 for the Macintosh and Palm OS platforms and 2.3 for the Microsoft Windows platform.

==Summary==
''PlayMaker Football'' allows one to take the role of a coach of a team of 30 football players. The coach can create a team using the Team Draft mode of the program, and then design and test plays using the Chalkboard Editor mode. The Chalkboard Editor mode also allows the coach to create artificial intelligence settings for each play, used by the program to determine which play to call on each down of a game. The Game mode allows the coach to play games between two teams, each under the control of a coach or the computer.

''PlayMaker Football'' spawned a small but dedicated community of players on online providers such as [[America Online]] and [[CompuServe]]. This community is still around today, with several [[internet]] sites available for coaches to join organized leagues.

''PlayMaker Football 2.0'' was released in 1996 for [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>{{moby game|id=/playmaker-football-20|name=''PlayMaker Football 2.0''}}</ref>
