'''''Wall Street Kid''''' is a [[video game]] released by [[SOFEL]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and it's a western spinoff of ''The Money Game'' series.

The player must prove the stockbroker's worth by taking $500,000 in [[seed money]] and growing it to $1,000,000 in order to gain a six-hundred-billion-dollar [[inheritance]] (equal to ${{Inflation|US|600|1990}} billion today) from the extremely wealthy Benedict family. Successfully investing it in the American [[stock market]] results in rewards like going shopping on the weekend and being able to acquire expensive items such as a house. The names of the companies listed in the stock market are slight variants on actual U.S. companies in operation at the time of the game's release.  The player is also encouraged to spoil the stockbroker's girlfriend. The game ends if the player is unable to raise the money needed for a key item such as a boat or the house, causing the stockbroker to be disowned by the family.
