'''''Bonk's Adventure''''', known as {{nihongo foot|'''''PC Genjin'''''|PC原人||lit. "PC Caveman"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan, '''''PC Kid''''' and '''''B.C. Kid''''' in Europe,<ref name="CVG130"/> is a scrolling [[platform game]] developed by [[Red Company]] and [[Atlus]] and released in 1989 in Japan and 1990 in North America for the [[PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16]]. The Japanese title ''PC Genjin'' is a play on the system's original name, PC Engine, with the European title ''PC Kid'' similarly referencing the system's name. The first game in the ''[[Bonk (series)|Bonk]]'' series, it was followed by two more games for the TurboGrafx-16 before branching out to other platforms.

''Bonk's Adventure'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Amiga]], as well as being released as a coin-operated [[arcade game]], under different titles ('''''FC Genjin''''' and '''''BC Genjin''''' in Japan, and '''''BC Kid''''' in Europe).<ref name="CVG130"/> A completely different game with the same name appeared on the [[Game Boy]] (under the title '''''GB Genjin''''' in Japan).

==Plot==
The game takes place in a fictional prehistoric era. Its protagonist is [[Bonk (series)|Bonk]], a strong and bald caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric enemies. Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink [[Plesiosaur]]-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green, [[Tyrannosaurus]]-type dinosaur).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonk's Adventure |url=http://bonkzonk.com/game.ktn?Game=pcg|work=The Bonk Compendium|accessdate=1 July 2010}}</ref> In the arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonk's Adventure - Arcade Version|url=http://bonkzonk.com/game.ktn?Game=kpcg|work=The Bonk Compendium|accessdate=1 July 2010}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Bonk's Adventure PCE.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of the original version]]
Bonk attacks enemies by "bonking" them with his large, invincible forehead. Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage, and three [[Life (gaming)|extra lives]]. Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s.

Bonk can also collect pieces of [[meat]] as [[power-up]]s; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger. There are three stages of a power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground, and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable. Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat. The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time. A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power, and a large one takes him to stage three. Eating small meat while in stage two will also put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power. When the third stage effect wears off, he returns to the second state and remains there for a while before turning back to the regular Bonk. Eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.

Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart, which restores all of Bonk's missing health. There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game, which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.

Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air. Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small "[[smiley]]" power-up. Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage. The player is given additional points and a caveman-type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.

The arcade version is much different: at the beginning of the game, the player can choose from one of 28 different levels. Unlike the console versions, the levels are extremely short, and the goal is to get to the end as quickly as possible while trying to get a high score. There are various sports items in the stages, like basketballs and footballs. As long as Bonk continues to dribble these items, the player will get bonus points. There is a goal post at the end of each level, which grants more points if Bonk hits it at its apex. After completing three stages, the player gets to choose from one of seven boss battles. There are no power-ups in this version. Instead, there are smiley faces, which attach themselves to Bonk's head and can be used to absorb enemy projectiles or extend the length of Bonk's attacks. However, if Bonk gets hit once, he will lose all of his smiley faces, and he will have to pick them up again. This version of the game also includes a two-player mode, where player 2 plays as a female Bonk. The game can be set up to dispense tickets, and the ticket payouts can be adjusted by the operator.

==Development==
The character of Bonk, known in Japan as ''PC-Genjin'' (PC原人, in English: PC-Caveman), was created by Kobuta Aoki and first appeared in comics created for the magazine ''Gekkan PC-Engine'', in order to promote the console in Japan. In Japanese, PC-Genjin sounds like ''PC-Engine'', and the PC stands for ''Pithecanthropus Computerus'', a pun on ''[[Pithecanthropus erectus]]''. It is generally called ''PC-Kid'' in English, as he was meant to be NEC's mascot at the time. Later, when the game was ported (or given different versions) for other platforms, it was renamed accordingly, like ''FC-Kid'' (after Family Computer, the original Japanese name for the NES, and the FC stood for ''Freakthoropus Computerus''), ''GB-Kid'' (after the Game Boy), or the more generic name ''BC-Kid'' in some other versions, including Amiga. In North America, this was scrapped, as the game name is always ''Bonk's Adventure'' or something similar.

==Reception==
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' picked the game as the #3 greatest game available in 1991, saying that it is much fun to watch and play at the same time.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Strauss |first=Bob |title=Video Games Guide |url=https://ew.com/article/1991/11/22/video-games-guide/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=1 March 2020 |date=November 22, 1991}}</ref> In 1997 ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' editors ranked the TurboGrafx-16 version as number 85 on their "100 Best Games of All Time", citing its imaginative level designs and hilarious player character.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=100 Best Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=107}} Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.</ref>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reviewed ''BC Kid'' for the Amiga and scored it 93% in 1992. Tim Boone praised the original ''PC Kid'' for the PC Engine as being among his "all-time fave console games" and said the Amiga port was a faithful conversion, but with a different title. While praising the original PC Engine version, however, the review criticized the American TurboGrafx-16 version for being titled ''Bonk'', which is an [[wiktionary:bonk|inappropriate slang]] in [[British English]].<ref name="CVG130">{{cite magazine |last1=Anglin |first1=Paul |last2=Rand |first2=Paul |last3=Boone |first3=Tim |title=4 Page Review: BC Kid (Amiga) |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=15 August 1992 |issue=130 (September 1992) |pages=22–5 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/0/08/CVG_UK_130.pdf#page=22}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 2003, Hudson Soft included a 3D remake of ''Bonk's Adventure'' in their ''Hudson Selection'' series of games released exclusively in [[Japan]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]] consoles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/bonksadventure/news.html?sid=6076053&mode=previews |title= TGS 2003: Bonk's Adventure Impressions |accessdate=2006-12-20 |last= Shoemaker |first= Brad |date= 2003-09-27 |work= [[GameSpot]] |publisher= [[CNet]]}}</ref>

[[Factor 5]], developers of the Amiga port, have made the Amiga version of ''BC-Kid'' available for free through their company website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://factor5.com/downloads.shtml |title= Factor 5 Classics page |accessdate=2008-01-05}}</ref>

The TurboGrafx-16 version was released for [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] on November 22, 2006, and according to informal surveys it has been one of the most purchased games.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/1gxEiPxZ-WivnWlULoSJVl4Tyy-ary_k | title = Nintendo - Official Site - Video Game Consoles, Games}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.joystiq.com/2006/12/06/turbografx-the-most-downloaded-virtual-console-games/ |title= TurboGrafx the most downloaded Virtual Console games?

In March 2008, a version for mobile phones was released in Japan.

Hudson was developing a reboot of the franchise entitled ''Bonk: Brink of Extinction'' for WiiWare and PlayStation Network. With the closure of Hudson, the status and future of this title is uncertain.

''Bonk's Adventure'' was released on the Virtual Console for [[Wii U]] on July 14, 2016, in its TurboGrafx-16 form.<ref>{{cite web|first=Liam |last=Doolan |title=Bonk's Adventure Has Been Rated By The ESRB For Wii U|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/10/bonks_adventure_has_been_rated_by_the_esrb_for_wii_u|accessdate=19 October 2015|date=October 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=ESRB|title=ESRB Rating (Bonk's Adventure)|url=http://esrb.org/ratings/Synopsis.aspx?logoonly=1&Certificate=22170&Title=Bonk%27s%20Adventure=|accessdate=19 October 2015|date=October 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Headbutt Your Way to Victory! |url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/bonks-adventure-wii-u |website=Nintendo.com |accessdate=1 March 2020}}</ref> The PC Engine version of the game (fully in Japanese) was included on every regional variant of the [[TurboGrafx-16 Mini]] which was released exclusively through [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] on March 19, 2020.
