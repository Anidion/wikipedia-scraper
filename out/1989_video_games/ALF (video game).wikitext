The game is the only [[home console]] game based on the ''ALF'' television show.<ref name="Games Database">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesdatabase.org/list.aspx?in=1&searchtext=alf&searchtype=1|title=Game search results - Games Database|website=www.gamesdatabase.org}}</ref> Other ALF games have been released for various computer systems, including ''[[ALF: The First Adventure]]'', the first ALF game. A couple of [[edutainment]] games based on the character were also released in later years: ''ALF's US Geography'' and ''ALF's Thinking Skills''.

==Gameplay==
The player controls ALF, who must collect the necessary items and solve puzzles to repair ALF's spaceship.

The game features several locations through which players can roam freely: ALF's house, street, basement of the house, ALF's backyard and a pond in the backyard. The player must collect various objects to progress in the game: a stick of [[salami]], which can be used to deal with the bats, [[Diving equipment|scuba gear]], allowing him to plunge to the bottom of the pond, and other objects. Items can be found as the game progresses and can also be purchased through the in-game store.

Some enemies in the game can be defeated, while others must be dodged, such as bats and street cyclists.

==Development==
The game was a side project for Kevin Seghetti, who at the time was under the employment for Nexa, then integrated with [[Spectrum Holobyte]], who in turn changed their name to Sphere. Although Seghetti was not a fan of the ''ALF'' TV Show, he worked heavily on the game's engine. The quality of the code he wrote was an improvement over the Master System version of ''[[Monopoly (1988 video game)|Monopoly]]''. The artwork was done in [[Deluxe Paint]] and converted via a [[Amiga]] to become transferable character and map files.

In the later stages of development, ALF was lacking audio and the producer John Sauer did not have adequate game design experience. With only a maximum budget of $200, Sauer managed to find Randy Roseberry to compose the music and sound. With weeks of revision and cleaning up the game's code, the game was shipped by the end of 1989, overruling Sauer's objection due to the crude quality of the product.<ref>{{cite book |title=Playing at the Next Level: A History of American Sega Games |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Fy6jwEACAAJ&pg=PA18 |last=Horowitz |first=Ken |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina]] |date=2016-10-19 |pages=18–20 |isbn=978-0-7864-9994-6}}</ref>
