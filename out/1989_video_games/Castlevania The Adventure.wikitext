''Castlevania: The Adventure'' received mixed reviews. The game was regarded difficult at times, with long levels and only three lives before playing the second cycle. The graphics were thought to be "competent", the music well-composed with memorable tunes.<ref name="gamespy">{{cite web|date=1999-01-01|url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/games/cva.html|title=Castlevania: The Adventure (1989)|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|access-date=2010-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109100414/http://www.castlevaniadungeon.net/Games/cva.html|archive-date=2010-01-09|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[IGN]]'' said it had a basic design, none of the series' staple bosses, and nothing original.<ref name="IGN"/> ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'s}} Tim Turi felt that it was held back by its technical limitations but praised its sound quality.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Ranking The Castlevania Bloodline |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/04/ranking-the-castlevania-bloodline.aspx |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |last=Turi |first=Tim |date=2012-04-04 |access-date=2013-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507064948/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/04/ranking-the-castlevania-bloodline.aspx |archive-date=2013-05-07 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Time Extension placed ''The Adventure'' second last on its list of ranked ''Castlevania'' games. It was described that "The gameplay is sluggish, the level design uninspired and the controls painful. Only a decent soundtrack saves this one from the scrapheap."<ref>{{cite web |last1=McFerran |first1=Damien |title=Best Castlevania Games - Every Castlevania Game Ranked |url=https://www.timeextension.com/guides/best-castlevania-games-every-castlevania-game-ranked |website=Time Extension |publisher=Hookshot Media |access-date=19 February 2023 |date=2 January 2023}}</ref>

In June 2006, a [[ROM hacking|ROM hack]] of the game was created. The hack, titled ''Quick Fix'', resolved many issues and criticisms with the game; Christopher Belmont moves at a much more reasonable speed, the whip does not downgrade when Belmont gets hit (however it still downgrades when he dies), and Belmont's hitbox was also slightly improved to prevent instances where he seemingly lands on a platform, but then "slips" off. The creator states that it was "Made on behalf of those who have played [''Castlevania''] ''Adventure'' and hated it due to certain drawbacks" before going on to mention said drawbacks.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/190/ | title=CVA Quick Fix }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=McFerran |first1=Damien |title=One Of The Most Hateful Castlevania Titles Has Been "Fixed" |url=https://www.timeextension.com/news/2023/01/one-of-the-most-hateful-castlevania-titles-has-been-fixed |website=Time Extension |publisher=Hookshot Media |access-date=24 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230123094532/https://www.timeextension.com/news/2023/01/one-of-the-most-hateful-castlevania-titles-has-been-fixed |archivedate=23 January 2023 |date=23 January 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref>
