== Gameplay ==

The game has no scroll. Instead, it has three different screens showing one third of the field each. In one the player gets a side view of the middle of the field. When the ball goes out of the screen, a new screen with the goal at its top is shown (the camera is "flying" over the middle of the field).

A triangle is used to indicate the height and side effect of each shot.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
