'''''WCW Wrestling''''' (a.k.a. '''''World Championship Wrestling''''') is a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[professional wrestling]] [[video game]] that was originally released in Japan in 1989 under the name ''Super Star Pro Wrestling'', with a different lineup of wrestlers. It was later released in North America in 1990 with a more familiar lineup of wrestlers.

It was the first (and, to date, only) video game based on the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (at the time, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] was a member of NWA). After [[The Road Warriors]] left WCW for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), WCW continued to advertise the game in their own catalogs with a [[Mock up|mock-up]] cartridge showing [[Steve Borden|Sting]] on the label, though no such copies of the game with an alternate label are known to exist or believed to have ever been manufactured. To date, the game has sold over 100,000 copies.

==Gameplay==
Each wrestler in ''WCW Wrestling'' has eight "selectable" moves, two Irish whip moves, and a finisher.

===Selectable moveset===
''WCW Wrestling'' differs from most wrestling titles in that the players select their wrestler's moveset prior to the match. Each wrestler has a menu of eight moves (with each wrestler featuring a unique moveset), from which players choose four (each move selected is assigned to a direction on the D-pad).

===Playable wrestlers and final opponent ===
Playable wrestlers in the game are [[Ric Flair]], [[Sting_(wrestler)|Sting]], [[Lex Luger]], [[Mike Rotundo]], [[Road Warrior Hawk]], [[Road Warrior Animal]], [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|"Dr. Death" Steve Williams]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], [[Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat]], [[Rick Steiner]], [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|"Hot Stuff" Eddie Gilbert]], [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael P.S. Hayes]], and the final opponent, a masked wrestler named "WCW Master".<ref>{{Citation|title=NES WCW Wrestling (Intro)|date=2008-08-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz_aAZCHdAk |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/Fz_aAZCHdAk |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|access-date=2016-11-29}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===Irish whip moves===
These moves are performed by first initiating an Irish whip (throwing the opponent into the ropes by pressing left and B or right and B) and then pressing either A or B when the opponent is near. Each wrestler has a different Irish whip moveset (though these moves are not selectable in the moveset menu).

===Finishers===
Each wrestler has his own finisher move. These must be performed in the middle of the ring and can only be accomplished when the opponent had two squares remaining on his health meter. The move is performed by pressing A and B simultaneously. Finishers deliver significantly more damage than a regular move and are likely to end the match in a knock-out or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]].

==''Super Star Pro Wrestling''==
[[File:Super Star Pro Wrestling cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Super Star Pro Wrestling'']]
''Super Star Pro Wrestling'' is a Japanese professional wrestling, or [[Professional wrestling in Japan|puroresu]], game made by [[Nihon Bussan]] and published by [[Pony Canyon]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Famicom]] system. Released on December 9, 1989, the game features play for both one- and two-player modes. It was released a year later in the United States as ''WCW Wrestling'' on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], with different wrestlers.

The game featured a different roster with wrestlers well-known in Japan's AJPW and NJPW promotions. It featured [[Antonio Inoki]], [[Giant Baba]], [[Jumbo Tsuruta]], [[Genichiro Tenryu|Gen'ichirō Tenryū]], [[Riki Choshu|Riki Chōshū]], [[Akira Maeda|Akira Maéda]], [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Stan Hansen]], [[Big Van Vader]], [[Abdullah the Butcher]], Road Warrior Hawk & Animal, and André The Giant.

Below is a list of which WCW Wrestlers that took the place of the original ''Super Star Pro Wrestling'' roster:
        
* Lex Luger replaced Antonio Inoki.
* Ric Flair replaced Giant Baba.
* Mike Rotunda replaced Jumbo Tsuruta.
* Kevin Sullivan replaced Gen'ichirō Tenryū.
* Sting replaced Riki Chōshū.
* Rick Steiner replaced Akira Maéda.
* Ricky Steamboat replaced Bruiser Brody.
* Road Warrior Hawk replaced Stan Hansen (even though he is in both versions, the ''WCW Wrestling'' version of Hawk is not based on the ''Super Star Pro Wrestling'' version; this is why the US version uses Hansen's trademark Western Lariat as a finisher in the game).
* Michael P.S. Hayes replaced Road Warrior Hawk.
* "Dr. Death" Steve Williams replaced Big Van Vader.
* "Hot Stuff" Eddie Gilbert replaced Abdullah the Butcher.
* Road Warrior Animal is the only one who remains unchanged. 
* WCW Master is based on André the Giant, the final opponent in ''Super Star Pro Wrestling''. His mask is reminiscent of André's "Giant Machine" gimmick.

There are some inaccuracies in the game, mainly with the birthdates of some wrestlers, and [[Big Van Vader]]'s hometown and date of birth are not listed in order to protect his [[List of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]].

==Other games==
''WCW Wrestling'' was the [[working title]] for at least two other WCW games. One was a canceled game for the [[game.com]] [[handheld game console|handheld system]]. The other was a sequel to [[Electronic Arts]]' ''[[WCW Mayhem (video game)|WCW Mayhem]]'', intended for release on the [[PlayStation 2]] platform (the game was later renamed ''WCW Mayhem 2'', and eventually canceled when WCW was sold to the WWF).
