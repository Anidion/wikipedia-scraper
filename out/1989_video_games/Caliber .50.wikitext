'''Caliber .50''' is a 1989 [[scrolling shooter]] arcade game developed by [[SETA Corporation]]. A port of the game was released for the [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]] in 1991.<ref>[http://segaretro.org/Caliber.50 ''Caliber .50''] at Sega Retro</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Caliber50Screenshot.png|250px|left|thumb|The player faces a large number of enemy troops.]]

Players control a [[United States Air Force]] pilot who was taken as a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Vietnam]] in 1972. The pilot must escape the prison compound by battling enemy soldiers with guns and [[grenade]]s. Various [[power-up]]s are available that give the player use of various other weapons including a [[machine gun]] and [[flamethrower]]. Enemy vehicles such as a plane can also be commandeered.<ref name=Crash />

The Sega Genesis version is single-player only, as the player now controls [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] Addis of the [[United States Army]], who must rescue his fellow soldiers twenty years after he failed to retrieve his men during the [[Vietnam War]]. He must now re-navigate through the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] in order to liberate his captured comrades-in-arms. Surviving soldiers are displayed by the [[dog tag]]s that appear on the screen at the end of each level. An option menu allows players to choose from either an easy, normal, or hard difficulty level in addition to the number of initial lives.<ref name="mobygames">[http://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/caliber50 ''Caliber .50''] at [[MobyGames]]</ref> This version expands on the arcade version with extra stages and bosses, and was advertised as being "2.5 times longer" than the arcade game. <ref>Electronic Gaming Monthly. No. 27. EGM Media, LLC. October 1991. p. 71.</ref>

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Caliber .50'' on their December 15, 1989 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=370|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 December 1989|page=23|lang=ja}}</ref>

The game has been compared to [[SNK]]'s ''[[Ikari Warriors]]''. [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] pointed out that like ''Ikari Warriors'', a vehicle can be commandeered in ''Caliber .50.'' [[Computer and Video Games]] compared the two games as well, calling ''Caliber .50'' "miles better" than SNK's game. Crash called the game "difficult" but said "there's enough blasting action to stop you from kicking the cabinet in frustration" and that the game was "Well worth a look." Meanwhile, Computer and Video Games wrote "Anyone who enjoys a good shoot'em up should love this..." and gave the game an 87% overall rating.<ref name=Crash>Caswell, Mark.
