'''''Radar Lock''''' is a 1989 video game developed and published by Atari for the [[Atari 2600]].<ref name="Weiss">{{cite book |last1=Weiss |first1=Brett |title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984 A Complete Reference Guide |date=2007 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786432264 |page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&dq=%22Radar+Lock%22+%22Atari%22&pg=PA96 |access-date=22 February 2021}}</ref><ref name="Atarian">{{cite news |last1=Ryno |first1=Steve |last2=Butler |first2=Brad |title=Reviews: Radar Lock (2600) |url=https://atariage.com/magazines/magazine_page.php?MagazineID=15&CurrentPage=10 |access-date=23 February 2021 |work=Atarian |date=October 1989 |page=8}}</ref>

==Development==
The game was announced in 1988, and was programmed by [[Doug Neubauer]].<ref name="Semrad">{{cite magazine |last1=Semrad |first1=Ed |title=Atari Adventure: More Games Scheduled for 1989 |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_03/page/n57/mode/2up?q=lock |access-date=25 February 2021 |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |issue=3 |date=1988}}</ref><ref name="Atarian" /> In developing the game Neubauer reused the game-engine from the Atari 2600 game ''[[Solaris (video game)|Solaris]]'', which he also worked on.<ref name="Weiss" /><ref name="Hawken" />

==Gameplay==
The game is essentially a clone of the Sega game ''[[Afterburner (video game)|Afterburner]]''.<ref name="Weiss" /><ref name="Hawken">{{cite book |last1=Hawken |first1=Kieren |title=The A-Z of Atari 2600 Games: Volume 2 |date=2018 |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |isbn=978-1785387623 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-JE3DwAAQBAJ&q=%22Radar+lock%22+%22Atari%22&pg=PT127 |access-date=23 February 2021}}</ref> The player pilots a [[Delta wing|delta-winged]] jet fighter armed with missiles and guns that they must periodically refuel and rearm. Two types of missiles maybe fired - radar guided missiles that home in on their targets, and "proximity" missiles that destroy everything within the area. Refueling is carried out by lining the aircraft up with a tanker to receive in-air refueling. The enemy aircraft faced by the player increase in number and capabilities as the game progresses, being drones at the beginning, followed by interceptors, then patrolling aircraft that approach from the rear, then bombers with escorts and stealth fighters, and finally "super bombers" firing larger numbers of missiles. To win the game the player must successfully pass through five missions, each of two waves. The game may be played single-player, or in a two-player co-operative mode with one player controlling the aircraft whilst the other controls the weapons.<ref name="Atarian" /> Accessing all the weapons requires use of the second joystick.<ref name="Herman">{{cite book |last1=Herman |first1=Leonard |title=ABC to the VCS |date=2005 |publisher=Rolenta Press |page=217 |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/details/book_abc_to_the_vcs_202006/page/n1/mode/2up?q=%22Radar+Lock%22 |access-date=25 February 2021}}</ref>

==Reception==
