{{nihongo foot|'''''Willow'''''|ウィロー|''Uirō''||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1989 [[arcade game]] by [[Capcom]]. Capcom published two different games in 1989 based on the [[Willow (1988 film)|1988 film of the same name]]. The arcade version is a [[platform game]] while the [[Willow (NES video game)|Nintendo Entertainment System version]] is an [[action role-playing game]].

Willow is a side scrolling platform and [[Run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] video game.<ref name="G33">{{cite magazine|last=Yamakawa|first=Yuri|url=https://archive.org/stream/gamest0033#page/n110/mode/2up|title=紹介 - ウィロー|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=33|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=June 1989|pages=105–107|lang=ja}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite magazine|title=Retro Reviews - Classic Capcom Arcade Games|magazine=Go Play|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|date=2006|page=102}}</ref> The game follows the film's plot:<ref name="RG123" /> The evil witch queen Bavmorda is after the holy baby of the lands, Elora Danan, intent on destroying her. A young peaceful wizard called Willow Ufgood was selected to protect Elora. Later on, a brave warrior named Madmartigan joins Willow to fight the enemy rival General Kael. Bavmorda is the final antagonist that they face off against. The arcade version of the game belongs to the [[Platform game|platform]] genre. It has six stages, some where Willow plays his part, others where Madmartigan plays his and one of the stages where either character is selectable.<ref name="MMv2i19">{{cite magazine|author=J.E.B.|url=https://archive.org/stream/micromania-segunda-epocha-19#page/n99/mode/2up|title=Arcade Machine - Últimas Novedades: Willow|magazine=[[Micromanía]]|volume=2|issue=19|publisher=Hobby Press|date=December 1989|pages=100–101|lang=es}}</ref> Madmartigan is a melee character who can fight only at close quarters, while Willow has a projectile attack.<ref name="RG123" />

The stages consist of Crossroad, Cherlindrea's Forest, Fin Raziel's Island, Sorsha's Camp, Tir Asleen Castle, and Nockmaar Castle. Each stage must be completed within a certain amount of time. Defeated enemies drop coins which the player can collect to buy things at shops. Depending on whether the player is playing as Willow or Madmartigan, either magic blasts or sword swipes are the attacks. Madmartigan's attack has less range than Willow's, but can destroy enemy projectiles. Both can purchase attack upgrades at shops. Madmartigan's upgrades give him greater power and range, while Willow's upgrades are far more versatile. With each upgrade, his regular blasts become more powerful, the actual upgrades being utilized by holding down the attack button and releasing it when the meter at the screen's bottom reaches a certain point. The following are his magical upgrades:

1. '''Moonlight''' - sends a crescent shaped blast forward, which splits into smaller beams on impact, damaging enemies in its path.

2. '''Tornado''' - sends a tornado shaped blast forward and at a slightly upward angle.

3. '''Gold''' - defeats most on-screen regular enemies; the coins they drop are worth twice their normal value.

4. '''Time''' - freezes all regular enemies and their projectiles for a few seconds, during which time Willow is invincible (he flashes blue).

5. '''Explosive''' - sends cascades of blasts to both forward and back of Willow.

6. '''Crystal''' - sends a circular barrier around Willow, damaging enemies in its path; this is the only of Willow's magic that can destroy projectiles.

== Development and release ==
''Willow'' for arcades is loosely based on the [[heroic fantasy]] movie of the same name by [[Ron Howard]]. Despite the film not doing well at the [[box office]], the film generated several video games and tie in [[Merchandising|merchandise]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Superjuegos_Xtreme_185#page/n101/mode/2up|title=La Máquina De Tiempo: Arcade - Willow|magazine=[[:es:Superjuegos#Cuarta etapa: 2006-2009|Superjuegos Xtreme]]|issue=185|publisher=[[:es:Grupo Zeta|Grupo Zeta]]|date=April 2008|pages=102–103|lang=es}}</ref> Capcom produced two video games based on the 1988 film, one being an arcade game and the other being an action role-playing game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name="SJARCw" /><ref name="RG123">{{cite magazine|title=The Unconverted: Capcom Special - Willow|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=123|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|date=December 2013|page=82}}</ref> The game was part of a broader strategy of Capcom at the time to appeal a wider audience by using established characters from other media, as director [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] stated that their original characters could be too niche, citing titles based on [[U.N.

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed it on their July 15, 1989, issue as being the second most-popular arcade game at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=360|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=July 15, 1989|page=33|lang=ja}}</ref> In North America, it was considered a successful title for the [[CPS (arcade hardware)|CPS]] board, with Capcom VP of Sales and Marketing Bill Cravens saying that "''[[U.N.

Multiple reviewers noted it plays similar to ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)|Ghosts n' Goblins]]'', also by Capcom.<ref name=":1" /> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' noted it had similar level design, and deaths they described as "cheap" designed to make players spend coins in the arcade. Since the game was never ported to a home console, they suggested buying ''[[Ghouls 'n Ghosts|Ghouls n' Ghosts]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive]] as an alternative.<ref name="RG123" /> ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]''{{'}}s [[Gary Whitta]] praised the graphics for both the characters and backgrounds while noting the character sprites looked like their movie characters. However, Whitta believed that the gameplay was limited and would mostly appeal to fans of the movie for a short period of time.<ref name=":1" />

Retrospective reviewers also praised the game.<ref name="RG123" /><ref name="SJARCw" /> [[PlayStation Portable]]-focused magazine ''Go Play'' reviewed Willow alongside ''[[The Punisher (1993 video game)|The Punisher]]'' and ''[[Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (video game)|Cadillacs and Dinosaurs]]'' calling them "some of the best CPS1 games you're unlikely to ever play on a Capcom compilation".<ref name=":0" /> ''[[IGN Italia]]''{{'}}s Stefano Castelli praised the game in 2019 and said he wished the game had been [[Porting|ported]] to home consoles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Castelli|first=Stefano|url=https://it.ign.com/ign-retro/152811/opinion/ign-retro-willow|title=IGN Retro: Willow - Direttamente dal cinema un sorprendente tie-in firmato Capcom|work=[[IGN Italia]]|publisher=Vusumo|date=March 30, 2019|access-date=December 12, 2020|lang=it|archive-date=March 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331132522/https://it.ign.com/ign-retro/152811/opinion/ign-retro-willow|url-status=live}}</ref>
