{{nihongo|'''''Dragons of Flame'''''|ドラゴン・オブ・フレイム|Doragon obu Fureimu}} is a [[video game]] released in 1989 for various [[home computer]] systems and consoles. It is a sequel to ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance|Heroes of the Lance]]''.<ref name="Zzap"/>

==Gameplay==
Like ''Heroes of the Lance'' it is [[Arcade game|arcade]] oriented, with few [[role-playing video game|RPG]] elements.<ref name="Zzap">{{cite magazine | title =Dragons of Flame | magazine =[[Zzap!64|Zzap!]] | issue =59 | page =23 | date =March 1990 | url =http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/dragoffl.htm | issn =0954-867X | access-date =2007-03-26 | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071224143219/http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/dragoffl.htm | archive-date =2007-12-24}}</ref> The style of the game is very much like its predecessor, horizontally scrolling fighting controlling one character at a time.

==Plot==
It is based on the second [[Dragonlance]] campaign module, ''[[Dragons of Flame (module)|Dragons of Flame]]'', and the second half of the first Dragonlance novel ''[[Dragons of Autumn Twilight]]''. The plot is a faithful representation of the books it is based on.

==Development==
''Dragons of Flame'' was adapted from the ''[[Dragons of Flame (module)|Dragons of Flame]]'' printed adventure module.<ref>{{cite web | title =Dragons of Flame | publisher =[[MobyGames]] | url =http://www.mobygames.com/game/dragons-of-flame | access-date =2007-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title =Dragons of Flame | publisher =[[World of Spectrum]] | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001500 | access-date =2007-03-26}}</ref> The game ''[[Shadow Sorcerer]]'' is a sequel to this game's storyline, but has quite different gameplay.

==Reception==
''Dragons of Flame'' was successful for SSI, selling 55,711 copies.<ref name="maher20170331">{{Cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2017/03/opening-the-gold-box-part-5-all-that-glitters-is-not-gold/ |title=Opening the Gold Box, Part 5: All That Glitters is Not Gold |last=Maher |first=Jimmy |date=2017-03-31 |website=The Digital Antiquarian}}</ref> According to [[GameSpy]], "while the number of characters was increased to 10, the gameplay remained the same moderately competent, hack-'n-slash, side-scrolling action, marking this as another less than stellar entry on SSI's resume".<ref>{{cite web | first=Allen | last=Rausch | date=August 15, 2004 | title=A History of D&D Video Games | publisher=GameSpy | url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538865p3.html | access-date=November 15, 2012}}</ref>

''[[ST Action]]'' magazine reviewed the [[Atari ST]] version, giving it an overall score of 73%: "When [[U.S. Gold]] announced they were going to produce an ''Advanced Dungeons and Dragons'' range I thought we were going to be in for the usual graphic-lacking role-playing games. ... I've been proven very wrong. This latest game seems to offer more of a challenge than its predecessor, ''[[Heroes of the Lance]]''. ... The thing I noticed about ''Dragons of Flame'' was the playability. Although the game uses complex menus, they have all been set out in a friendly, easy-to-use manner". ''ST Action'' also praised the variety of monsters, graphics, and "well implemented" gameplay.<ref>{{cite magazine|title = Dragons of Flame Review|date = January 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/ST_Action_Issue_021_1990-01_Gollner_Publishing_GB/page/n59|magazine = ST Action|publisher = Gollner Publishing|issue = 21|pages = 58–59}}</ref>
