As with many Simulations Canada computer games, the game is text-only, and a [[hex grid]] map and counters are packaged with the game to allow the players to see visually what is happening in the game. 

==Publication history==
Simulations Canada had started in the 1970s publishing [[board wargames]]. With the rise of the personal computer in the early 1980s, SimCan begn to create text-only computer wargames that included a hex grid map and counters. One of these was ''Malta Storm'', created by Stephen Newberg, programmed by Robert Crandall and published in 1989 with box art by John Kula.

==Reception==
Sam Punnett reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "As a pure entertainment product, many will feel the limitations placed by ''Malta Storm'''s design and lack of chrome makes it a less than desirable game for the casual gamer. As a command study, however, ''Malta Storm'' has plenty to offer aficionados of military history who are more concerned with strategy than presentation."<ref name="CGW74">{{cite magazine |last=Punnett |first=Sam |title=Storm In The Mediterranean: Simulations Canada's Malta Storm |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September 1990 |volume=1 |issue=74 |pages=22, 73}}</ref>
