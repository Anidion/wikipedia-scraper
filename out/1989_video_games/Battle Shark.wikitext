'''Battle Shark''' (バトルシャーク) is a first-person [[shoot 'em up]] released as an [[arcade video game]] by [[Taito]] in 1989. The player looks through a [[submarine]] [[periscope]] to destroy enemies while avoiding [[torpedo]]es and [[missile]]s.

The player starts with a limited amount of torpedoes, which slowly replenishes itself. Power-up targets appear throughout the games, which can increase the supply of torpedoes, repair damage, or add extra firepower. At the end of each stage, the player faces off against a boss character.

The Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) nominated ''Battle Shark'' for the "Most Inventive" award in 1990. The game was released for ''[[Taito Legends]]'' in 2005.

==Plot==

The story in Battle Shark involves a third world war (World War 3 or WWIII). According to the description in the game's attract mode introduction, "extremely brutal fighting has been taking place on land, and now the battlefield is expanding into the oceans."

Peace negotiations, the fictional allies then discover, are an enemy trap, and that the enemy has actually been buying time to create an underwater fortress at the bottom of the sea.

''Battle Shark'', with its driver, a navy soldier, must fight its way through hordes of enemy submarines, boats, and vehicles to track down the fortress, and ultimately destroy it.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Battle Shark'' on their May 1, 1990 issue as being the sixth most-successful upright arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=379|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 May 1990|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>
