==Reception==
Michael S. Chaut and Matt Rosenburg reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The gameplay as well as the real-life aspects of the game seem to be covered completely. Overall, this game is a must for the sports simulation and statistical buff as well as the multi-player game fan. The game also takes into account whether the player is a "joystick jockey" or not and allows a set-up where strategy is the main concern. Considering the expandability factor and the flexibility in game play, SportTime's ''Omni-Play Basketball'' is tops!"<ref name="CGW65">{{cite magazine |last1=Chaut |first1=Michael S. |last2=Rosenburg |first2=Matt |title=Smooth As Silk: SportTime's "Omni-Play Basketball" |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=November 1989 |volume=1 |issue=65 |pages=28, 62, 64}}</ref>
