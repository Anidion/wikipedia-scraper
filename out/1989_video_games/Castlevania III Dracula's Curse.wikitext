It was released in Japan in 1989, and in North America in 1990, and in Europe by [[Palcom]] in 1992. It was later released on the [[Virtual Console]] for the [[Wii]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], and [[Wii U]].

''Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse'' is the third installment in the ''[[Castlevania]]'' video game series. It is a prequel to the original ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'', set a few centuries before the events of the original game. The game's protagonist is [[List of Castlevania characters#Trevor Belmont|Trevor C. Belmont]], an ancestor of the original hero [[List of Castlevania characters#Simon Belmont|Simon Belmont]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Castlevania 3 gameplay.png|thumb|left|The player can choose between two stages to follow at several points in the game.]]
''Castlevania III'' abandons the [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements of its immediate predecessor ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'' and returns to the [[platform game]] roots of the first ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'' title. Unlike ''Castlevania'', however, ''Castlevania III'' is [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]]: Trevor, the main character, can be assisted by one of three possible companions, and after completing the first [[Level (video games)|level]], and at several other points throughout the game, the player is given a choice of two [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching paths]] to follow. The player can obtain [[multiple endings]] depending on the choices they make throughout the game.

There are two main routes through the game's sixteen stages, which are referred to as blocks and are broken down into several sections. The second stage is an optional excursion for picking up one of the three partner characters, and the main branch occurs part way through the third stage. Each route contains a total of nine stages (ten if the player takes the optional second stage). The upper route takes the player across the lake to the main bridge, entering Dracula's castle through the front gate, while the lower route takes the player through a series of tunnels and caverns, leading to a climb up the cliff face below the castle. The lower route also features one short branching section of its own at stage 6. The two paths converge in the main hall of the castle.

==Plot==
The year is 1476, and [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Count Dracula]] has started to ravage Europe with an army of monsters. The Belmont family of vampire hunters, once exiled from [[Wallachia]], are called into action. They feared the Belmonts' "super-human" power, but with Dracula menacing to swallow Europe in darkness, they are left with no choice but to call [[List of Castlevania characters#Trevor Belmont|Trevor Belmont]] (Ralph C. Belmondo in the Japanese version), current wielder of the [[Vampire Killer whip]].

Joining Trevor Belmont in his mission to defeat Dracula are three new playable characters: [[Sypha Belnades]], a young sorceress with poor physical attack power but powerful elemental magic spells at her disposal; [[Grant Danasty]], a pirate with the ability to climb on walls and change direction in mid-jump; and [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]], Dracula's son, a [[dhampir]] with the ability to shoot fireballs and transform into a [[bat]]. Trevor can be accompanied by only one companion at a time. If he chooses to take on another he must abandon his current companion. The player can "spiritually transform" between Trevor and his ally with the "select" button. Both Trevor and whoever is accompanying him share the same health meter and heart counter. The ending of the game differs depending on which companion Trevor has with him at the time, or if he does not take another character with him at all.

==Development and release==
Besides the different title, ''Akumajō Densetsu'', the Japanese version has several other differences. It contains a specialized [[Memory management controller (Nintendo)#VRC6|VRC6]] [[coprocessor]] chip. The game's audio programmer, Hidenori Maezawa, assisted in the chip's creation. This chip added two extra [[pulse wave]] channels and a [[saw wave]] channel to the system's initial set of five sound channels. The majority of the music combines the channels to imitate the sound of a [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] string section. Western versions of the NES did not have the ability to support external [[sound chip]]s, so the North American release replaced the VRC6 with Nintendo's [[Memory management controller (Nintendo)#MMC5|Memory Management Controller 5]] (MMC5).<ref>{{Cite web |title=VRC6 |url=https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/VRC6 |access-date=2023-05-11 |website=NESdev Wiki |language=en}}</ref> The game's music had to be changed by Yoshinori Sasaki to comply with the NES's standard five channels. ''Akumajō Dracula Famicom Best'' was a soundtrack album that included the Famicom version of the game's original music.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Akumajo Dracula Famicom Best музыка из игры |url=https://www.game-ost.com/albums/2660/akumajo_dracula_famicom_best/ |access-date=2023-05-11 |website=Game-OST |language=en}}</ref>

In the Japanese version, instead of using a stabbing dagger, Grant throws daggers as his main attack. Some enemies do less [[Health (game terminology)|damage]] in the Japanese version, and had their sprites changed for the Western releases. Some instances of nudity on the enemies were censored, and religious iconography was pared down. The Japanese version has slightly different backgrounds in many stages, and has special effects not seen in the North American and European releases.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse/Regional Differences - The Cutting Room Floor |url=https://tcrf.net/Castlevania_III:_Dracula%27s_Curse/Regional_Differences |access-date=2023-05-11 |website=tcrf.net}}</ref>

The North American and [[PAL region|PAL]] versions have several hidden features that can be accessed by entering a certain name for the player, which include starting the game with 10 lives (by entering the name "HELP ME"), the option to start the game with any of the three spirit partners, and to access the second, more difficult quest. These features are not present in the Japanese version.<ref name=":0" />

It was released in Japan on December 22, 1989, in North America on September 1, 1990, and in Europe on December 10, 1992. The game also received a Windows release on November 16, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/561575-konami-collectors-series-castlevania-and-contra|title=Konami Collector's Series: Castlevania & Contra|website=[[GameFAQs]]|access-date=2015-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912160805/http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/561575-konami-collectors-series-castlevania-and-contra|archive-date=2015-09-12|url-status=live}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=August 2020}} The North American packaging artwork was painted by Tom Dubois, who stated that he was inspired by animator [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s works.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/07/tom_dubois_talks_about_creating_some_of_the_most_iconic_boxart_of_the_nes_and_snes_eras|title=Tom Dubois Talks About Creating Some Of The Most Iconic Boxart Of The NES And SNES Eras|last=McFerran|first=Damien|work=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=2016-07-29|access-date=2023-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730180648/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/07/tom_dubois_talks_about_creating_some_of_the_most_iconic_boxart_of_the_nes_and_snes_eras|archive-date=2016-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/konamis-nes-box-art-so-good-so-bad|title=Konami's NES Box Art: So Good, So Bad|last=Oxford|first=Nadia|work=[[VG247]]|date=2017-07-17|access-date=2023-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231217082605/https://www.vg247.com/konamis-nes-box-art-so-good-so-bad|archive-date=2023-12-17|url-status=live}}</ref>
