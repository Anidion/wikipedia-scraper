'''''Destiny of an Emperor''''', known in Japan as {{Nihongo foot|'''''Tenchi wo Kurau'''''|天地を喰らう|"The Devouring of Heaven and Earth"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, is a [[strategy role-playing game]] by [[Capcom]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] based on the ''[[Tenchi wo Kurau]]'' [[manga]] by [[Hiroshi Motomiya]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Vestal |title=The History of Console RPGs |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=1998-11-02 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/nes8.html |access-date=2011-01-06 |ref=gspot_consolehist |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608225623/http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/nes8.html |archive-date=2009-06-08 }}</ref> It was originally released in Japan in 1989, with an English language localization released for the North American market in 1990.

==Story==
Liu Bei, Zhang Fei, and Guan Yu form a small [[militia]] to defend their village from [[Yellow Turban Rebellion|Yellow Turban rebels]], followers of the sorcerer [[Zhang Jiao]]. Liu Bei gathers peasants and farmers from nearby villages and camps, eventually defeating Zhang Jiao and his people. [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]], the governor of [[Xu Province]], falls ill and requests that Liu Bei assume his position. Liu Bei hesitantly agrees, thus beginning the events depicted in the novel, albeit with significant alterations. Upon successfully completing the game, the player successfully unites China under the [[Shu Han]] banner.

Although the game loosely follows the events portrayed in ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', in many cases, the outcome is altered in Liu Bei's favor against the various other [[warlord]]s of the period. Most of the deviations occur later in the game, particularly involving the invasions of the other ruling powers, the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Sun Wu]] and the [[Cao Wei|Kingdom of Cao Wei]].

The branching [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] allows the player the option of choosing alternate paths, which generally do not affect the plot in any significant manner.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Destiny of an emperor game.png|thumb|left]]
Unlike virtually every other RPG released at the time or since, the non-boss battles of ''Destiny of an Emperor'' do not consist solely of encounters with generic units. While generic enemy units do appear in the game, most random battles are fought against one or more generals randomly selected from those roaming the lands the player's party is traveling through at the time. Additionally, most of these unique units can be recruited. After being defeated in battle, there is a random chance that the general will offer to join the party, usually under the condition that the player character pays him a bribe of either money or horses (which can be purchased at item shops). Once recruited, the general will no longer be encountered in random battles.

Because of this system, the game has an exceptionally large number of playable characters, 150 in all. However, many of these characters do not increase in power even when they accumulate experience points, making them useful only for a limited time. Also, the player may only have up to 70<!-- It's been 3-4 years since I've played the game, so I'm only 90% sure of this number; it might be 60, or 80. If you happen to be in the middle of a game, please check it! --> characters in his party. After reaching this limit, the player can only recruit new characters if he ejects characters from his party to free up the slots. After being removed from the party, generals are again the player's enemies and can once more be encountered in random battles.

The player's active party consists of up to seven members, five of which can actively participate in combat at any single time, one who serves as a replacement for characters killed in combat, and one to serve as both a reinforcement member and party [[military tactics|tactician]]. The tactician provides [[Magic in fiction|magic]]-like effects, which all members involved in combat are able to use.

In addition to standard attack and tactics options available in most games of the type, there is an option called "All-Out". When chosen, the computer AI takes control of the battle, which proceeds at an extremely fast rate. This is solely a way of speeding up the easier battles and has no tactical advantage, as the player is unable to coordinate attacks or employ tactics, while the AI-controlled enemy can.

==Release==
''Destiny of an Emperor'' is based on [[Hiroshi Motomiya]]'s [[manga]], ''[[Tenchi wo Kurau]]'', which follows the story of Chinese historical figure [[Liu Bei]] and his [[Oath of the Peach Garden|sworn brothers]], [[Zhang Fei]] and [[Guan Yu]]. This story is loosely based upon the events in the 14th-century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]], which itself was based on historical events and battles which occurred before and during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]].<ref name="parish">{{cite web |url=https://retronauts.com/article/60/retronauts-pocket-episode-15-destiny-of-an-emperor |title=Retronauts Pocket Episode 15: Destiny of an Emperor |work=[[Retronauts]] |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |date=February 10, 2014 |access-date=May 28, 2020}}</ref> ''Destiny of an Emperor'' was included in the "Nintendo Classic Mini: Family Computer Weekly Shonen Jump 50th Anniversary Commemoration Version," a console created to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the weekly Japanese manga magazine ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump|Shōnen Jump]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/japans-getting-a-special-nes-classic-loaded-with-dragon-ball-games/ |title=Japan's getting a special NES Classic loaded with Dragon Ball games |work=[[CNET]] |last=Buckley |first=Sean |date=May 10, 2018 |access-date=May 28, 2020}}</ref>

A sequel to ''Destiny of an Emperor'', ''[[Tenchi wo Kurau II: Shokatsu Kōmei Den]]'', was released exclusively for the Japanese Family Computer.

==Reception==
Jeremy Parish praised it as "interesting" and "adorable," suggesting people check it out while noting that it is not an "oft-mentioned classic."<ref name="parish"/> 9dragons of ''RPGamer'' discussed how the game was fun, but the story did not interest them when they were younger. When they tried the game at a later age, they felt more invested in the game, now knowing that it is based on historical events, which made them feel like they were "living the history."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.rpgamer.com/editor/nightshadow/032501nd.html |title= History and Videogames: Two Great Tastes  |work=RPGamer |author=9dragons |access-date=May 28, 2020}}</ref> Ethan Gach of ''[[Kotaku]]'' expressed hope that ''Destiny of an Emperor'' would be released for the [[Nintendo Switch]]'s NES library.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/these-games-deserve-spots-in-the-switch-online-nes-libr-1836259662 |title=These Games Deserve Spots In The Switch Online NES Library |work=[[Kotaku]] |last=Gach |first=Ethan |date=July 10, 2019 |access-date=May 28, 2020}}</ref> Joshua Jankiewicz of ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' felt it odd that it was released in the United States due to the reticence of publishers to release role-playing games, particularly those with "Eastern" themes, in the United States. They lamented the lack of press coverage at the time for the game, praising it for being challenging without being unfair in a way that other games often fail to do. They also praised the auto-battle function, feeling it a good way to keep battles with weaker enemies from feeling tedious. However, they found the exploration limited and monotonous and felt that problems with the game, such as money and food being too abundant and the high number of characters being useless due to the proficiency of the five main characters, pop up in the latter part of it. Despite this, they felt these flaws were not significant due to it being Capcom's first attempt at a role-playing game.<ref name="hg101">{{cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/destiny-of-an-emperor/ |title=Destiny of an Emperor |work=Hardcore Gaming 101 |last=Jankiewicz |first=Joshua |date=July 3, 2014 |access-date=May 28, 2020}}</ref> Author Andy Slaven felt it was "all too often overlooked," calling its gameplay unique, challenging, and fun.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnPRd6QwvbQC |title=Video Game Bible, 1985-2002 |page=101 |last=Slaven |first=Andy |year=2002 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |isbn=9781553697312}}</ref>

In 2007, a hacking tool was created called ''Destiny of an Editor''. This tool was originally meant to alter stats, but over time gained additional functionality, including the ability to edit maps, text, enemy encounters, and graphics. The hacking community went on to create the Huan Ho awards, celebrating the best ''Destiny of an Emperor'' hacks.<ref name="hg101"/>
