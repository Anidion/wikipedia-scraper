{{nihongo|'''''Tough Turf'''''|タフターフ}} is a 1989 [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[beat 'em up]] [[arcade game]] developed by [[Sunsoft]] and [[Sega]]. It was published by Sega in Japan and by Sunsoft of America in North America.

==Gameplay==
Up to two players control two men who look like officer workers, and proceed through warehouses and urban areas beating up gang members, but the characters are not named and the game has no storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retrovania-vgjunk.blogspot.com/2015/04/tough-turf-arcade.html|title=VGJUNK: TOUGH TURF (ARCADE)|date=14 April 2015 |publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref> ''Tough Turf'''s control configuration is composed of two attack buttons (punch and kick), as well a jump button to fight against enemies or overcome obstacles. The player has access to a repertoire of techniques by pushing these buttons individually or in combination. Weapons are also along the lines of long iron pipes, knives and broken bottles.

==Reception==
According to Kurt Katala of Hardcore Gaming 101, "considering there was very little variation amongst the ''[[Final Fight]]'' and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' clones that popped up in the early 90s, [''Tough Turf''] is interesting to play a game that requires a different approach, and it really is a fresh alternative to ''[[Double Dragon]]''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/toughturf/toughturf.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Tough Turf|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>
