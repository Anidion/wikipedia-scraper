The game starts when Kane is summoned by Daikak, the great leader of the Summit Temple, to stop a war between factions of [[warlord]]s. The player explores temples and defeats enemies like ghosts, ninja and feral beasts. There are also villages to explore and people to talk to as the player assembles clues on who desecrated his home town's temple and killed its guardians.
