'''''Storm Warrior''''' is a 1989 [[beat 'em up]] video game developed and released by [[Elite Systems]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Commodore 64]] 8-bit home computer systems. The game casts the player in the role of a prince on a quest to rid his kingdom of a witch's curse. It is unrelated to the [http://www.mobygames.com/game/storm-warrior 1984 game ''Storm Warrior''].

== Gameplay ==
In ''Storm Warrior'', the player controls a hero armed with a sword, who may walk and turn, jump into various directions, defend and attack with his sword (high and medium slashes), kick, and roll.<ref name=mse /> The character walks right through a series of screens, fighting defeating various enemies along the way.

== Plot ==
The evil Witch Queen has summoned a terrible thunderstorm that is to last a hundred years, causing torrential rains, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other calamities. The heir prince of the kingdom embarks on a dangerous quest to reach the castle from which the Witch Queen exercises control on the elements, so he can kill her and break the spell.<ref name=mse>{{in lang|es}} [https://archive.org/stream/micromania-segunda-epocha-15/Micromania_Segunda_Epoca_15#page/n19/mode/1up/ Review] in ''Micromania Segunda Epoca'' 15.</ref><ref name=cdu /><ref name=cvg />

== Development and release ==
The C64 version was made by the same team which did the C64 port of ''[[Forgotten Worlds]]''.<ref>Preview in ''CU Amiga'' 8/1989.</ref> The Witch Queen was known as "Queen of Darkness" in an early version of the game.<ref>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ACE/Issue16/Pages/ACE1600024.jpg Preview] in ''ACE'' 16.</ref>

The game was released straight to Elite's Encore budget range on both cassette and disk for the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC. Although the back cover labelled one of the screenshots as [[ZX Spectrum]], all screenshots show the C64 version and no version was released for the ZX Spectrum.

== Reception ==
The game was poorly received.<ref name=cdu>[https://archive.org/stream/commodore-diskuser-14/Commodore_DiskUser_Issue_14_1989_Dec#page/n43/ Review] in ''Commodore DiskUser'' 14.</ref> The C64 version of the game received the scores of 44% from ''[[Computer + Video Games]]'' ("[[Mark Cooksey]]'s music is pleasant, but otherwise the game has few merits"), 64% from ''[[Your Commodore]]'' ("an average game" and not in a top division of beat-em-up games") and 51% from ''[[CU Amiga]]'' ("Basically, ''SW'' is just a very dull ''[[Barbarian (1987 video game)|Barbarian]]'' clone").<ref name=cvg>[ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue096/Pages/CVG09600074.jpg Review]{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in ''C+VG'' 96.</ref><ref>Review in ''Your Commodore'' 63.</ref><ref>Review in ''CU Amiga'' 10/1989.</ref> ''Micromania Segunda Epoca'' gave it 6/10, recommending the Amstrad version.<ref name=mse />
