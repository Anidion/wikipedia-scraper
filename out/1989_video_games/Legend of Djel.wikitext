'''''Legend of Djel''''' is an [[adventure game]] developed by [[Coktel Vision]] and Inférence and published in 1989 by Tomahawk for [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[MS-DOS]].

== Plot ==
The player takes the role of a gnome named Djel. On their deathbed, his parents ask him to clear their name, proving they were of good moral character and not the magic-using troublemakers they were known for. He also needs to defeat a sorcerer.

== Development ==
Tomahawk was launched as a sister company to Coktel Vision in early 1989. Its first release, ''Emmanuelle'', was negatively reviewed by critics. ''Legend of Djel'' previewed in ''Amiga Computing'' in August 1989. The sorcerer's daughter is visually based on the girlfriend of the game's graphic artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_26388|title=Legend of Djel preview from Amiga Computing Vol 2 No 3 (Aug 1989) - Amiga Magazine Rack|website=amr.abime.net|access-date=2018-06-16}}</ref>
