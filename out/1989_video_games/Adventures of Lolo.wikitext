'''''Adventures of Lolo''''' is a [[puzzle video game]] released in 1989 by [[HAL Laboratory]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It is a compilation of puzzles from ''Eggerland: Meikyū no Fukkatsu'' and ''Eggerland: Sōzō he no Tabidachi''. It is the fifth game in the ''[[Eggerland]]'' series, the third one released in Europe, but the first one released in North America. It was available on the [[Wii]]'s and [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in North America and in [[PAL region]]s, as well as on the [[Nintendo Switch Online]]'s virtual Nintendo Entertainment System library.

The game received two direct sequels: the Japanese ''Adventures of Lolo'', that consists entirely of new stages, and the American ''[[Adventures of Lolo 2]]'', that is another collection of stages from earlier Japanese games. However, in 1994, a game titled ''Adventures of Lolo'' was released for Game Boy in Europe and Japan. Said Game Boy release was not the same game as the original NES release of the same name, but rather the tenth installment in the series, with continued additions to the base gameplay.

==Premise and gameplay==
[[File:Adventures of Lolo.jpg|thumb|left|Lolo (left) up against a snake-like enemy (right)]]
The player assumes the role of Lolo, a round anthropomorphic creature. Lolo attempts to rescue Princess Lala, who has been kidnapped by the evil King Egger. Lolo travels to Egger's castle, with 50 rooms arranged in 10 floors of five. Within each room, Lolo must collect several hearts in order to open a treasure chest and collect the gem inside, which will open the exit to the next room or floor. The player must navigate the obstacles in each room and avoid or neutralize several different types of enemies, which vary by movement and attack pattern. All enemies disappear once Lolo picks up the gem.

The player can move, slide certain blocks around the screen, and fire a limited number of shots at enemies. When an enemy is shot, it becomes encased in an egg for a short time; this can be pushed to a new location, used as a bridge to cross water, or shot again to make it disappear temporarily. Lolo can gain other powers on specific screens, such as the ability to smash rocks or build a bridge. Some enemies are not affected by Lolo's shots.

One life is lost whenever Lolo is shot or touched by certain enemies. Others will not kill him, but can impede his movement by standing still or freezing in place when touched. The player can restart a screen at any time, at the cost of one life.

==Development and release==
''Adventures of Lolo'' was developed and published by HAL Laboratory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in North America on April 1989 and in Europe in February 1991. A Nintendo representative commented that Nintendo was "trying to stretch the kids' imaginations" with ''Lolo''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&p_theme=wt&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0EEBCF87AE6D7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D|title=Fanning Flames of Nintendo Fever|last=Brookes|first=Stephen|date=1990-04-09|work=[[The Washington Times]]|access-date=2011-01-17|page=52|via=[[NewsBank]]}}</ref> It was re-released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2007 on 8 June in North America and on 6 August in [[PAL region]]s.

===Legacy===
''Adventures of Lolo'' was followed by two sequels for the Japanese FamiCom and two sequels for the NES: the Japanese ''Adventures of Lolo'' and ''Adventures of Lolo 2'', consisting of new stages, the American ''[[Adventures of Lolo 2]]'' (another compilation of stages from earlier games) and ''[[Adventures of Lolo 3]]'' (based on the Japanese ''Adventures of Lolo 2'', but consisting mostly of new stages). A [[Game Boy]] follow-up was released in 1994 in Japan as ''Lolo no Daibouken'', but it was localized with the same name, ''Adventures of Lolo''.

Lolo and Lala, the game's [[protagonist]]s, have appeared under the monikers Lololo and Lalala in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' and later in its adaptation in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', as well as in ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', where they play an [[antagonist]]ic role. Both game series are made by [[HAL Laboratory|HAL Laboratory, Inc.]] There is also a Lolo reference in [[Super Meat Boy]].
