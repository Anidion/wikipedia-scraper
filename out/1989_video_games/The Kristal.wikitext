'''''The Kristal''''' is an [[adventure game]] first released in 1989 for the [[Amiga]] computer. It was later released for the [[Atari ST]] and [[MS-DOS]]. It was developed by the [[UK]]-based company Fissionchip Software, and published in Europe by [[Addictive Games]] and in the US by [[Cinemaware]]. Unusually for a video game, the game is based on a [[Play (theatre)|play]], ''The Kristal of Konos'', written in 1976; the authors of the play worked together with the game developers and the play was never shown in theatres or on film before the game's release. A dialog introducing the setting was recorded by [[Patrick Moore]], who introduced both the game and play.

The player takes the role of a pirate named Dancis Frake, on a mission to recover the "Kristal" on behalf of the Kring<!-- typo?  Really "Kring", not "King"?--> of Meltoca.

The game features a number of different classic game genres merged: [[fighting game|fighting]], [[Space flight simulator game|space flight/combat]], and (to a limited extent) [[LucasArts]]-style point-and-click [[adventure game|adventuring]].

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1989 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #152 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4{{frac|1|2}} out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon152"/> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave the game a negative review, citing the poor controls for the action sequences and the repetitive interrogation of other characters. The review stated that ''The Kristal'' is virtually unplayable, and that only the arcade gamers who have the time and patience will master this "challenge".<ref name="CGW"/>
