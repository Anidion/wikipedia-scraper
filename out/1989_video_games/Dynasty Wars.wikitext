'''''Dynasty Wars''''', released in Japan as {{nihongo foot|'''''Tenchi wo Kurau'''''|天地を喰らう||lit. ''The Devouring of Heaven and Earth''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, is a 1989 side-scrolling [[beat-'em-up]] game released for [[Arcade game|arcades]] by [[Capcom]], based on the Japanese [[manga]] ''[[Tenchi wo Kurau]]'' and a reenactment of the battle between the Kingdom of Shu and the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion|Yellow Turban rebels]]. Each of the two players can assume the roles of one of the four Chinese generals riding on horseback from the [[Three Kingdoms]] period in an attempt to smash the rebellion. A sequel, ''[[Warriors of Fate]]'', was released in 1992.

==Gameplay==
The players' goal is to wipe out the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion|Huang Ching]], the organization responsible for the unrest of the Han dynasty and later defeat the tyrant [[Dong Zhuo]], and up to two players can fight side by side to accomplish this goal. This game always scrolls to the right. Players must be able to survive the rebel hordes to reach and kill the rebel general in each stage to free the province.

Players can use three buttons: to attack left, attack right, or use special tactics. In the arcade version, inserting more coins and pressing START increases the maximum life of the player. In an [[role-playing game|RPG]] style, completing stages and collecting yellow orbs increase the [[experience points]] of the player in order to level-up, where he gains more vitality and use stronger weapons. These weapons are upgraded for every 3rd blue orb collected. In-game treasure increases player score, and food packs replenish vitality.

There are 4 selectable characters, each with their own varying amounts of attack power and initial vitality. Aside from unique weaponry, each character also has a unique partner character during a certain special attack. For every 3 blue orbs collected, the player's weapon improves, depending on his current level range.

There are a total of eight stages (called rounds), corresponding a province in reference to the historic battles in the novel.
