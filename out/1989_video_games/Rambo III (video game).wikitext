'''''Rambo III''''' is a series of video games based on the film ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988). Like in the film, their main plots center on former [[Vietnam War|Vietnam-era]] [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] [[John Rambo]] being recalled up to duty one last time to rescue his former [[commander]], Colonel Sam Trautman, who was captured during a [[covert operation]] mission in [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Soviet-controlled]] [[Afghanistan]]. [[Taito]] released an [[arcade video game]] based on the film. The console versions were developed and published by Sega, the [[IBM PC compatible]] version was developed by Ocean and published by Taito, and Ocean developed and published the other home computer versions: Atari ST, Amiga, Spectrum, C64, Amstrad CPC.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Ports==
The [[Master System]] version, released in 1988, is a [[light gun shooter]] along the lines of ''[[Operation Wolf]]''. The [[Light Phaser]] is supported.<ref name="CVG"/> 

The [[Mega Drive]] version, released in 1989, follows Rambo in six missions, in each one with various objectives. Besides finding the exit of the level, in some missions, prisoners must be freed or enemy [[ammunition]] supplies destroyed. Rambo is controlled from an [[overhead perspective]] and has several weapons at his disposal. Besides a [[machine gun]] that never runs out of ammo, he can use a knife for close range kills, set off timed bombs and use his famous longbow with explosive arrows. Ammunition for the bow and the bombs is limited and can be collected from dead enemies. Rambo himself, on the other hand, is vulnerable and can be killed after one hit.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

After some of the missions, the perspective switches to a view behind Rambo and additional boss fights take place. Soviet tanks or helicopters must be destroyed using the bow. While aiming the bow, Rambo cannot move, but otherwise he can hide behind rocks or other obstacles from enemy fire. This is reminiscent of the [[Taito]] arcade game of the same name, which also had the player firing into the screen at helicopters and jeeps, but instead of just a single segment after each stage, the whole game is played out in this perspective.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Amstrad CPC]] versions have three missions, and vary drastically from the console versions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
