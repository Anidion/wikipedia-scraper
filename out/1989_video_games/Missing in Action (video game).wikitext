'''''M.I.A.: Missing in Action''''' is an [[Action game|action]] [[arcade game]] released by [[Konami]] in 1989.  The game is a spiritual successor to ''[[Green Beret (arcade game)|Green Beret]]'' (also known as ''Rush'n Attack''). The game is influenced by popular action movies of the time such as ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'', ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', and ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]''.

==Gameplay==
The player takes on the role of a [[United States Army Special Forces|US Army special operations]] Green beret and player 2 takes the role of a soldier of the [[United Nations]] in cooperative mode. Players must infiltrate enemy [[POW]] camps in [[Vietnam]] to find prisoners of wars and lead them to freedom. Like its predecessor, there are a total of six [[Level (video games)|levels]] in the game: war-torn field, jungle, airstrip, railyard, POW camp, and escaping POW camp.  ''M.I.A.'' can be played by up to two players, with player 1 in green and player 2 in blue.

Throughout most of the game, the player's main weapon is a knife, which is capable of destroying any enemy in the game. By killing the red enemy soldiers, the player can acquire additional weapons. The available weapons consist of an [[assault rifle]] (12 rounds), a [[flamethrower]] (2 rounds), a [[bazooka]] (3 rounds), and [[grenade]]s (3 rounds). Unlike ''Green Beret'', the player can carry more than one weapon and switch between them at will. If the player loses a life, then only their currently equipped weapon will be lost.

At the end of each level, an assorted number of troops appears on fixed machine gun positions (usually four) that must be eliminated. On the last mission of the game, the freed hostages are susceptible to being slain by enemies; if all the POWs get killed then "MISSION FAILED" flashes on the screen and the [[Game over|game is permanently over]].

==Versions==
There were three versions of ''M.I.A.'': Versions S and T, which were produced for the American and international markets, and a Japanese version. In some versions, the order of the first four stages is randomized. In the Japanese version, every second stage scrolls from left-to-right instead of right-to-left as in the international versions.

''Missing in Action'' was made available on [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] ''[[Game Room]]'' service for its [[Xbox 360]] console and for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows-based]] [[personal computer|PC]]s in December 2010.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Missing in Action'' on their March 15, 1989 issue as being the twentieth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=352|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 March 1989|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>
