'''''Demon's World'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''Horror Story'''''|ホラーストーリー|''Horā Sutōrī''||lead=yes}} in Japan.}} is a 1989 [[Shoot 'em up#Run and gun|run and gun]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] originally developed by [[Toaplan]] and published in Japan by [[Taito]] and in North America by Catalina Games.<ref name="G49">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/gamest0049#page/51/mode/2up|title=東亜プラン|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name="TFf25v9">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|date=June 2009|pages=1–70|lang=ja}} ([https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201010170328/https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332|date=2020-10-10}}).</ref> In the game, players assume the role of two ghost hunters to fight against several [[ghosts]] and [[monsters]] that were unleashed upon [[Earth]] by the titular demon [[king]]. Initially launched for the arcades, the title was then [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to the [[TurboGrafx-16#Super CD-ROM²|PC Engine Super CD-ROM²]] by [[NEC Avenue]] and published exclusively in Japan on 26 February 1993, featuring various additions and changes compared with the original release.

''Demon's World'' was met with mixed response from critics, who reviewed the PC Engine Super CD-ROM² version as an [[Parallel importing in video games|import title]] despite being exclusive to Japan. As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge, and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan [[Intellectual property|IP]]s.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Demon's World (Horror Story).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]
''Demon's World'' is a [[Horror fiction|horror]]-themed [[Side-scrolling video game|horizontally-scrolling]] run and gun game where players assume the role of two ghost hunters through ten increasingly difficult linear autoscrolling stages across various locations, some of which have a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be fought before progressing any further in an effort to defeat several ghosts and monsters that were unleashed upon Earth by the titular demon king as the main objective.<ref name="MBASICM85">{{cite magazine|last=Musha|first=Ryota|url=https://archive.org/stream/micomBASIC_1989-07#page/n239/mode/2up|title=Super Soft Corner: Video Game - ホラーストーリー|magazine=[[:ja:マイコンBASICマガジン|Micom BASIC Magazine]]|issue=85|publisher=[[:ja:電波新聞社|The Dempa Shimbunsha Corporation]]|date=July 1989|pages=288–290|lang=ja}}</ref><ref name="D'sWhg101">{{cite web|last=Plasket|first=Michael|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/demons-world/|title=Demon's World|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=13 November 2017|access-date=2019-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601203321/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/demons-world/|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="D'sWss">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/hora-story.html|title=ホラーストーリー|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2019-10-25|language=ja|archive-date=2019-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025170506/http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/hora-story.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="VGDPCESCD-ROMhs">{{cite magazine|last=Kermel|first=Laurent|url=http://www.videogameden.com/cdrom.htm?hos|title=Pc Engine CDrom²: HORROR STORY|magazine=videogameden.com|publisher=Video Game Den|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>

The [[player character]]s are armed with a [[gun]] complete with energy pack reminiscent to the ''[[Ghostbusters (franchise)|Ghostbusters]]'' [[Media franchise|franchise]] to shoot various ghosts and monsters that infest each stage, though players can also defeat enemies by jumping on them, in addition to performing a double jump to move across platforms as well.<ref name="D'sWhg101"/><ref name="D'sWss"/> Along the way, players can collect multiple a weapon power-up to change their gun to fire lasers, [[bomb]]s or a spread shot.<ref name="MBASICM85"/><ref name="D'sWhg101"/><ref name="D'sWss"/> Other [[Item (gaming)|item]]s can also be collected during gameplay such as "P" icons that, after collecting three icons in a row, grants the players a shield that takes an extra enemy hit and heart icons that give points.<ref name="MBASICM85"/><ref name="D'sWhg101"/><ref name="D'sWss"/> Firing on determined locations is crucial to reach high-scores and get extra lives, as certain [[setpiece]]s in some stages hosts bonus secrets.

While the better known version of the  arcade game started in a relatively modern town at a telephone booth and continues to advance to the haunted American Old West themed levels, an alternative arcade version and the home console version for the PC Engine shuffle these levels around: There the opening stages of the title take place in an eastern setting, starting in the fantasyland of China and moving on to Japan, featuring various spirits and creatures of [[Japanese folklore]]. Some of these include  [[Karakasa|ghostly karakasa]], [[chochinobake]], [[Kappa (mythical creature)|kappa]], [[hitotsume-kozou]] and [[rokurokubi]]. The game then changes course, moving to a ghostly pirate ship and then the haunted [[American Old West]], featuring a [[ghost town]] and a canyon inhabited by traditional ghosts and monsters from western culture such as [[Frankenstein's monster]], [[Dracula]], and even [[Jason Voorhees]]-style masked monsters. 

In all variants of the game, the final stretch takes place in a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] setting, complete with cursed castles and dungeons infested with haunted armor, goblins and dragons.<ref name="D'sWhg101"/> But the PC Engine version and the less known alternative arcade revision add a cave segment between the last dragon and the final boss. Thus, both of these versions share a similar amount of content, but the PC engine version adds an additional mid-boss to the western town segment (a cowboy skeleton that throws scorpions).

''Demon's World'' uses a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name="D'sWhg101"/> Getting hit by enemy fire, colliding against certain stage obstacles, falling off the stage or running against any enemy will result in losing a life and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to [[Glossary of video game terms#Continue|continue]] playing. Although there is an ending, the game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous titles from Toaplan, with each one increasing the difficulty.
