==Reception==
''[[ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment)]]'' reviewed the game in their January 1990 issue and called it "a disappointment",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_6769|title = The Third Courier review from ACE: Advanced Computer Entertainment 28 (Jan 1990) - Amiga Magazine Rack}}</ref> and in their July 1990 issue gave it a rating of 65% and commented that "If you think living in an oppressed society is romantic and exciting, you probably deserve to play this game."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_14442|title = The Third Courier review from ACE: Advanced Computer Entertainment 34 (Jul 1990) - Amiga Magazine Rack}}</ref>

Dennis Owens reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' and commented that "''The Third Courier'' should have been the sophisticated rock and rolling superspy story that it wants to be (indeed, its fiction is strong and its puzzles are tricky). Instead, its mechanics make it awkward and slow."<ref name="CGW70">{{cite magazine |last=Owens |first=Dennis |title=The Third Courier |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1990 |volume=1 |issue=70 |pages=24, 26}}</ref>

''[[Zzap!64|Zzap!]]'' reviewed the game in their June 1990 issue and gave it a rating of 43% overall, and stated that "If exploring Berlin, talking to drunks and visiting every accessible establishment on every street in an effort to find the odd clue sounds like fun to you, well, I recommend this sleuthing RPG. Otherwise, forget it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_10800|title = The Third Courier review from Zzap 62 (Jun 1990) - Amiga Magazine Rack}}</ref>

''[[Amiga Action]]'' reviewed the game in their July 1990 issue and gave it a rating of 62% overall, describing it as a merely average game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_26647|title = The Third Courier review from Amiga Action 10 (Jul 1990) - Amiga Magazine Rack}}</ref>

John Scott for ''[[Games International]]'' said "I was disappointed - ''The Third Courier'' is a different type of game altogether. I expect that this format of game must appeal to ''some'' people, since it keeps reappearing in various guises, but it does nothing for me, other than give me an overwhelming urge to go watch some paint dry."<ref name="gi15">{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/details/GamesInternational/GI_15_Jun_1990/page/n45/mode/2up | last = Scott |first = John | title =Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 15 | pages =46â€“48 |date=June 1990}}</ref>
