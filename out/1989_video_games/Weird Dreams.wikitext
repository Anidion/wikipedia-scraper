'''''Weird Dreams''''' is a [[cinematic platform game]] developed by [[Rainbird Software]] which was published for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[DOS]]. A modified version served as the visual component to a phone-in quiz on ITV's ''[[Motormouth]]''.<ref name="birdsanct">[http://www.birdsanctuary.co.uk/wd/i.php The Bird Sanctuary]</ref> The game was planned for release on [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]], but both versions were cancelled.<ref name="WeirdDreams-CVG">{{cite magazine |author=Eugene Lacey |date=November 1993 |title=Game Reviews |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_090_1989-04_EMAP_Publishing_GB/Computer__Video_Games_Issue_090_1989-04_EMAP_Publishing_GB#page/n17 |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |publisher=[[Ascential|EMAP]] |issue=90 |pages=18–22 }}</ref>

==Plot==
The background story is told by a 64-page novella with 19 chapters written by [[Rupert Goodwins]].

Steve is in love with his attractive coworker Emily. Unbeknownst to Steve, Emily is possessed by a [[Daemon (mythology)|daemon]] named Zelloripus who was banished to Earth, stripped of most of her powers, and trapped in a human female{{dubious|Emily and Zelloripus|reason=It could be more correct to say that Emily is an incarnation of Zelloripus|date=September 2017}} due to unspecified crimes done to other daemons. Emily sees a chance to let someone else suffer and stifle her boredom. She tricks Steve into taking three pills she has mixed to "cure his flu". While the pills do cure him, they also grant Zelloripus access to his body and mind. His dreams become both more lucid and strange, each one getting more intense and painful. Steve's [[psychiatrist]] does not understand what causes the dreams, and neither does Steve. He refers him to a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]]. After his health dramatically declines, Steve undertakes [[Neurosurgery|brain surgery]] in an attempt to stop the dreams. Under an [[Anesthetic|anaesthetic]], he slips into one more dream, possibly his last.

==Gameplay==
The game starts where the novella ends, with Steve lying on the operating table and slipping into the dream world. Steve is controlled by the player through numerous [[surrealism|surreal]] worlds. He can collect certain weapons and items on these levels, but with a few exceptions, cannot carry them to another level. Steve has no health meter, but there is a heart rate monitor, which goes from 75bpm (normal) to 100bpm (in frightening situations) to 170bpm (shortly before death). He immediately dies if he comes into contact with an enemy or an obstacle. He can also die if he remains too long in certain areas such as the Country Garden, where a [[lawnmower]] will come and kill him. When Steve dies, the game returns to the scene in the operating room where the surgeons attempt to save him, only to flatline and then for his heart to start back up. If you get a gameover, Steve will flatline and his heart will not beat again, kicking you back to the titlescreen. There are no save points in the game, and instead of score points the player's progress is stated as a percentage and a time counter.

There is an in-game cheat code for infinite lives: the player has to be standing halfway (To the point that Steve looks like a blob) in the right-hand-side mirror in the Hall of Mirrors (which functions as a Hub level) then input the morse code for S.O.S. (3 short strikes, 3 long strikes, 3 short strikes) using a specific key from the keyboard ('Help' key on Atari ST, and the "+" key on MS-DOS (must be the numerical plus key on a keyboard that has a numerical pad)). Pressing Help/Numerical+ on any section of a level will allow you to skip said section. Pressing Help/Numerical+ in the Hall of Mirrors will disable the cheat. Having the cheat enabled allows you to respawn immediately where you died instead of having to watch the "operating table" scene every time you lose a life.

There are 15 different enemies/challenges, 7 different death animations and 5 different musical scores by C64/Amiga musician [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]] on the Amiga. [[Barry Leitch]] did the music for the Commodore 64 and PC version. The game also features a couple actual pieces of music, such as [[Country Gardens]] and [[Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy]].

After defeating the final boss, Steve wakes up on the operating table like when you lose a life, only you do not flatline. The surgeon in the bottom right grins madly at the camera while holding a knife. The screen cuts to black.

==Development==
The general plot was conceived by the developers, and Rupert Goodwins was asked to write the novella included with the game.<ref name="birdsanct"/>

The scenarios in the game are not based on Serrano's own nightmares, but are inspired by the paintings of [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Terry Gilliam]]'s cartoon animations for [[Monty Python]], and on odd observations. After a visit to the dentist, Serrano developed a phobia of teeth, which is noticeable in the design of the monsters, many of them having mouths with large teeth.

The game took over a year to produce.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_22670|last=Penn|first=Gary|date=June 1989|title=Weird Dreams(Review)|journal=The One for 16-bit Games|issue=9|page=80|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref>

==Release==
''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' did a competition called "Ooooh What a Nightmare Compo", which required participants to send a picture of their worst nightmares. The judging was done by a professional artist and the winners received blow-up fish bathtoys and Weird Dreams/Motormouth T-Shirts as prizes.<ref name="WeirdDreams-CVG"/>

The Amiga release is often regarded as the best version of the game, having the highest quality soundtrack and the most sound effects. Interestingly, the Commodore 64 release is often said to be the easiest version of the game while also being the worst due to its limited graphics and the many changes made to it, such as the ending cutscene being replaced with a simple "congratulations" splash screen.
