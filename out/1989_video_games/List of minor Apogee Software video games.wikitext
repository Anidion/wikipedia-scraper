'''''Adventure Fun-Pak''''' is a collection of four video games created by [[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] and various independent developers who submitted their programs to Apogee for publication. Miller categorized these submissions by genre and released this collection and the companion ''Puzzle Fun-Pak'' as non-shareware commercial products.

* '''''Night Bomber''''' is an [[artillery game]] in which the player attempts to destroy as many cities as possible by issuing orders to a gun to fire projectiles at a specified angle.
* '''''Raiders of the Forbidden Mine''''' (also known as ''Raiders of the Lost Mine'', ''Diamond Digger'' and ''Gold Miner'') is a [[real-time game|real-time]] [[action game]] with gameplay and a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective reminiscent of [[Dig Dug]] and [[Paganitzu]]. The objective is to collect as many gold nuggets as possible by maneuvering the [[player character]] through a series of levels situated in an underground mine while evading enemies capable of killing upon contact. Each level contains oxygen boxes to ensure the player character does not run out of breathable air and a key needed to unlock the door to the next level.
* '''''Rogue Runner''''' (also known as ''Maze Runner'') utilizes [[ASCII]] graphics to depict a maze from an overhead third-person perspective. Gameplay is similar to Apogee's ''[[Kroz]]'' series; the objective in each level of the maze is to maneuver the player character in real-time through a series of corridors and evade enemies to find the entrance to the next level. Scattered throughout each level are pickaxes which may be used to kill attacking opponents, teleport scrolls capable of instantly transporting the player character to a random point within that level's maze, and maps which reveal the maze to the player in greater detail. The game ends when the player retrieves the Heart of Courage from the deepest level of the dungeon or is killed by contact with an enemy. Designed by Scott Miller, the game was also published under the name ''Maze Runner'' in [[Softdisk]]'s ''[[Big Blue Disk]]'' #26 released in December 1988.<ref name="BigBlueDisk">{{cite web|last=Stoddard|first=Samuel|title=What's Apogee's relationship with Softdisk?|work =The Apogee FAQ (Version 7.2w)|publisher=RinkWorks|date=30 September 2005|url=http://www.rinkworks.com/apogee/s/2.7.2.shtml|accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>

Dave Sharpless designed and developed the game in cooperation with Apogee. [[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] had obtained his address from a registration [[text file]] accompanying an earlier shareware game he had self-published.

The first was freely distributable as shareware and the remaining three episodes were commercial products which could be purchased directly from Apogee.

Developed by [[George Broussard]] and originally published by his label Micro F/X Software, it was marketed and distributed by Apogee after Broussard joined the company. The game consists of three volumes each featuring 100 multiple choice questions related to ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''. Questions randomly chosen from the volume's database are sequentially presented to the player, who responds by selecting a numbered response from a list. For each correct answer, the game reveals a bonus ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' fact. Players begin the game with three credits; every ten correct responses earn the player an additional credit, but each incorrect response costs the player one credit.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Trivia|developer=George Broussard|publisher=Micro F/X Software/Apogee Software |date=1987|platform=MS-DOS|scene=Instructions}}</ref> When the player runs out of credits or has attempted all 100 questions, the game ends and the player's level of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' knowledge is ranked on the basis of how many questions were correctly answered.

''Star Trek: The Next Generation Trivia'' was marketed via the [[3D Realms#Shareware and the Apogee model|Apogee model]]. Only the first volume was freely distributable as shareware; the remaining volumes were commercial products which could be purchased directly from Apogee.

When the ''Star Trek'' copyright holder [[CBS Paramount Television|Paramount]] discovered that Apogee was profiting from their intellectual property, they offered Apogee a license for the game idea. Apogee did not accept the offer, as the license would have cost more than what Apogee was making on the game.<ref name="SieglerParamout">[http://forums.3drealms.com/vb/showthread.php?p=30108#post30108] Joe Siegler explains the rationale for not accepting a license agreement from Paramount.</ref> Therefore, Apogee discontinued the game, and they no longer retain any copyright or control over on it.<ref name="NoCopyright">[http://legacy.3drealms.com/games.html] "We do not retain any copyright or control on the following titles: ''Star Trek Trivia'', ''Star Trek: TNG Trivia'', and ''Jumpman Lives!''

'''''Supernova''''' is a [[text adventure]] video game designed by Scott Miller for MS-DOS and published by [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]]. The game's text was co-written by Scott Miller and Terry Nagy. Although ''Supernova<nowiki>'</nowiki>s'' plot is unrelated to that of Miller's previous text adventure ''[[Beyond the Titanic]]'', its [[game engine]] and [[look and feel]] represent an evolutionary development from the earlier game. No images accompany the game's textual descriptions, but a variety of colors are employed to enhance the layout of the game's text. A panel near the top of the screen continuously displays the player's score, location, number of moves thus far, and the [[player character]]'s condition (e.g. thirsty). Also included is the ability to save the game and restore a previously saved game. Miller wrote that the game features over four hundred sound effects, 16-color [[ASCII]] graphics, a hint command and a [[parser]] which recognizes over a thousand words.<ref name="READALL"/> The game begins with the player character seeking employment on the surface of a barren mining planet. As the game progresses, the player discovers that an imminent supernova is threatening to destroy a [[planetary civilization]].
