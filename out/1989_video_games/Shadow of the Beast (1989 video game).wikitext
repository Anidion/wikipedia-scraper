'''''Shadow of the Beast''''' is a [[platform game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Reflections|Reflections]] and published by [[Psygnosis]] in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]]. The original version was released for the [[Amiga]], and was later ported to many other systems. The game was known for its graphics, with many colours on screen and up to twelve levels of [[parallax scrolling]] backdrops, and for its atmospheric score composed by [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]] that used high-quality instrument samples.

It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Shadow of the Beast II]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Shadow of the Beast III]]'' in 1992. [[Shadow of the Beast (2016 video game)|A remake]] was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] in May 2016, and included the Amiga original.<ref name="PS4wOrig"/>

==Gameplay==
{{More citations needed|date=February 2023}}
The core gameplay of ''Shadow of the Beast'' is that of a basic action side-scroller. The player guides Aarbron through the world, fighting monsters of varying frequency with a small variety of attacks, which is slowly improved upon over the course of the game; Aarbron starts the game by punching enemies, eventually using attacks like fireballs and even a [[Laser-gun|laser gun]], each with their own set of basic pros and cons. The gameplay mostly alternates between traversing vast expanses of mostly flat terrain accompanied by a wide range of scenery (which takes up a significant portion of the game, and has led to some criticism{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}}), and fighting groups of hostile monsters, similar to a [[Beat 'em up|beat-em-up game]]. At spaced-out, fixed points in the world, the player will encounter a [[Boss (video games)|boss]], which must be defeated in order to proceed further.

==Plot==
A man named Aarbron is kidnapped as a child and corrupted through magic into a monstrous warrior-servant for the evil beast lord Maletoth. The creature's memory of his human life returns when he watches a man being executed, whom he later recognizes as his father. This prompts Aarbron to seek revenge on Maletoth. A long arduous journey ensues, with Aarbron forced to battle his way through both hostile terrain and Maletoth's forces. He eventually confronts one of Maletoth's minions, a gargantuan creature whose only visible body parts are its hand and foot. Defeating the creature, Aarbron is freed from his curse, the eponymous "Shadow of the Beast", and returned to a more humanoid form.

==Development==
''Shadow of the Beast'' was designed by Martin Edmondson and Paul Howarth of [[Ubisoft Reflections|Reflections]] over the course of nine months, and it was their second 16-bit game after their previous game, ''[[Ballistix]]''. Edmondson and Howarth described it as their "most ambitious project to date", and stated that they wanted the game to push both the Amiga and Atari ST to their technical limits. To achieve this, the Amiga version was written first, so that they would take advantage of all of the computer's advanced hardware capabilities. The developers made use of the hardware sprites and scrolling rather than using the [[blitter]], which they felt that the blitter "does not run quite as fast as some people would believe." To get the speed they wanted, the developers employed difficult techniques such as the [[sprite multiplexing]].<ref name="Manual - Pages 12 to 14">{{Harvnb|Psygnosis|(1989)|pp=12–14|ref=sotb1-manual}}</ref> The game uses up to twelve levels of [[parallax scrolling]],<ref name="Ars Technica">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/05/amiga-history-part-7/3/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227022251/http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/05/amiga-history-part-7/3/|title=A history of the Amiga, part 7: Game on!|first=Jeremy|last=Reimer|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=13 May 2008|access-date=28 December 2015|archive-date=27 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and up to a maximum of 128 colours on screen.<ref name="Manual - Pages 12 to 14" />

The game was also designed to be as difficult as possible; Edmondson remarked that he liked difficult games at the time and he "used to get frustrated if the game was too easy."<ref name="History of the Beast">Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/KE1hF-mHNcc Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160505020543/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE1hF-mHNcc Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite AV media|date=4 May 2016|title=History of the Beast |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE1hF-mHNcc|first1=Matt|last1=Birch|first2=Martin|last2=Edmondson|subject-link2=Martin Edmondson|first3=Roger|last3=Dean|subject-link3=Roger Dean (artist)|access-date=12 May 2016|format=video|publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The game's cover art was designed by British artist [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]], who has also done cover artwork for other [[Psygnosis]]-published games.<ref name="Polygon Roger Dean">{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/2/14/3768030/roger-dean-outside-the-box-psygnosis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222181820/http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/2/14/3768030/roger-dean-outside-the-box-psygnosis |title=The Art Outside the Box: The Story of Roger Dean |first=Tracey |last=Lien |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=14 February 2013 |access-date=18 January 2016 |archive-date=22 February 2016 |url-status=live |quote="The box art for Psygnosis' ''Shadow of the Beast'' features reptilian robots walking through a sunburnt landscape.

The instruments were created using the [[Korg M1]] synthesiser and then sampled at 20&nbsp;kHz.<ref name="Manual - Pages 12 to 14" /> Ruben Monteiro's [[arrangement]] of the game's music was released in 1999, on an Amiga music compilation album ''Immortal''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiga-immortal.com/cds/immortal1/immortal1.htm|title=Immortal 1|publisher=Amiga Immortal|access-date=7 May 2016}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' regarding ''[[Shadow of the Beast III]]'s'' development, the development team behind ''Beast III'' noted that the original ''Shadow of the Beast's'' selling point was its graphics, and Edmondson states that "It was definitely a case of being in the right place at the right time. Apart from how many colours and layers of parallax and monsters we could squeeze on screen, no thought went into it whatsoever", and furthermore calls ''Shadow of the Beast'' a "graphics showcase".<ref name=prerelease /> In regards to ''Beast I's'' parallax scrolling, Edmondson expresses that "In ''Beast I'', we chose the most obvious and the easiest way of doing it, but the problem with that was that you couldn't have monsters running over the foreground at the same time. They had to be very spaced out and nowhere near interesting parts of the map."<ref name=prerelease /> ''Beast III'' reused no assets from the first two games, with Edmondson stating with regards to ''Beast I'' that "the original code for ''Beast I'' was so bad. It was the first thing we really did seriously and when you look back on it, it's very slow and inefficient and could have been done 10 times better."<ref name=prerelease>{{cite magazine|title = Shadow of the Beast III Pre-Release Interview|date = February 1992|url = https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-41|magazine = The One|publisher = emap Images|issue = 41|page = [https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-41/page/n31 32]-34}}</ref>

In a retrospective article for ''[[Digital Spy]]'', Mark Langshaw remarked that ''Shadow of the Beast'' "will always be remembered as one of many jewels in the crown of Studio Liverpool." Langshaw however said that the Mega Drive version was considered inferior to other versions, and because of its poor conversion rate, the game ran faster than intended on the North American Genesis console and "went from unforgiving to near impossible."<ref name="Digital Spy Retro Corner" /> Travis Fahs of [[IGN]] considered the [[FM Towns]] port a superior version of the game.<ref name="IGN: Die 16-bit Die!">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/05/die-16-bit-die |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113012111/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/05/die-16-bit-die |title=Die, 16-bit, Die! |first=Travis |last=Fahs |page=1 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=5 December 2008 |access-date=18 January 2016 |archive-date=13 January 2016 |url-status=live |quote=The {{bracket|FM Towns}} Marty library is sizable, but there aren't a lot of exclusives.
