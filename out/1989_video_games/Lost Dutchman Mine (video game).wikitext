'''''Lost Dutchman Mine''''' is a [[Linearity (computer and video games)|non-linear]] adventure video game which puts the player in the role of a gold miner, circa 1860 A.D. The game was the biggest success for its publisher, Magnetic Images.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The player was free to roam around the desert and town at will, constrained only by the need to make sure he had enough food to eat and a safe place to sleep. Earning money could be accomplished in a variety of ways, including panning for gold in a river, mining for gold in a cave or capturing a wanted bandit. Food could be purchased or caught from a river if the player had previously acquired fishing gear.

The game became well known for its breezy, free-flowing nature. The game was also notable for not having a single environment for the player to operate in; the location of mines and rivers, and the details of characters a player could meet were different, each time the game was played.

== Reception ==
[[Abandonware]] website ''[[Abandonia]]''{{'}}s Ted Striker reviewed ''Lost Dutchman Mine'' with: "There are different modes that the game will put you in, which are equally basic and so fun (something basic is something fun). The game runs on real-time and you need to do what you would need to do in a real expedition: get well equipped, be sure to check your supplies often and don't panic once you encounter danger. After all, isn't it, this very feature, that makes a game addictive in the first place ?"<ref name="Striker 2006">{{cite web|first1=Ted|last1=Striker|url=http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/740/.html|title=Download Lost Dutchman Mine|work=[[Abandonia]]|publisher=Abovo Media Group|date=January 1, 2006|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}</ref>
