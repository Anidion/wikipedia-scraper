== Gameplay ==
[[File:NES Willow.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]
The player takes the role of Willow Ufgood, who wages a battle against evil, wielding swords, shields, magic spells, and items to defeat enemies. Unlike the film and arcade game, Willow generally travels alone, only briefly meeting several other characters. The game contains some [[role-playing video game]] elements, as Willow gains experience and levels up from defeating enemies in real time combat.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=September–October 1989|title=Nintendo Power|magazine=Nintendo Power|volume=8|pages=61}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|date=January–February 1990|title=Nintendo Power|magazine=Nintendo Power|volume=10|pages=24–29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|date=November–December 1989|title=Nintendo Power|magazine=Nintendo Power|volume=9|pages=8–13}}</ref> Rather than battery saving, it uses a password system to save the game.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> The game has no money system, and all items are found in the game.<ref name=":2" />

== Development ==
''[[Willow (1988 film)|Willow]]'' is a 1988 film produced by [[George Lucas]], directed by [[Ron Howard]], and starred [[Warwick Davis]] in the title role as Willow Ufgood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reportajes/willow-juegos-basados-pelicula-lucasfilm-94754|title=Willow - Los juegos basados en la película de Lucasfilm|last=Martinez|first=David|date=2017-04-06|website=HobbyConsolas|language=es|access-date=2018-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025183255/http://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reportajes/willow-juegos-basados-pelicula-lucasfilm-94754|archive-date=2017-10-25|url-status=live}}</ref> Capcom developed two games based on Willow in 1989.<ref name=":4" /> The arcade game plays similar to Capcom's previous fantasy action platformer ''[[Ghouls 'n Ghosts|Ghouls n' Ghosts]]''.<ref name=":5">{{Cite magazine|date=December 2013|title=The Unconverted: Arcade Games that never made it Home|magazine=Retro Gamer|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=123|page=82}}</ref> The Willow game developed for the NES is a role playing game.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":4" />

''Willow'' is part of a series of games released in the five years after the original ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', which were described as "zelda clones". Other games like this include ''[[Neutopia]]'' by [[Hudson Soft|Hudson]], ''[[Golden Axe Warrior]]'' by Sega and ''[[Crystalis]]'' by SNK.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=February 2013|title=Zelda: A Link to the Past|magazine=OLD!GAMER|language=ES|location=Spain|publisher=Editora Europa|issue=13|page=21}}</ref>

Capcom director [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] commented that the game was part of a broader strategy of Capcom at the time to appeal to a wider audience by using established characters from other media, as their original characters could be too niche.<ref name=":3">{{Cite magazine|date=November 1989|title=Developer Interview Capcom Developer: Yoshiaki Okamoto, Noritaka Funamizu|magazine=[[Gamest]]|publisher=[[Shinseisha]] Ltd.|volume=4|issue=11|pages=10–21}}</ref> He cited games based on [[U.N. Squadron|''Area 88'']] and ''[[Destiny of an Emperor]]'' as part of this strategy.<ref name=":3" />

The music was composed by [[Harumi Fujita]]. She said “I put a lot of energy into the music for Willow. The producer of Willow was the same producer who made Mega Man. He was an extremely talented individual and I was elated to have the chance to write music for his game, so I put my all into it. I’m not sure how well the game itself was received, but it was fun.”<ref>{{Cite web|title=Harumi Fujita – 2011 Composer Interview|url=http://shmuplations.com/harumifujita/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920094351/http://shmuplations.com/harumifujita/|archive-date=2020-09-20}}</ref>

[[Shinji Mikami]] noted that when he joined Capcom in 1990, all of those who were accepted into the company got a free copy of the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/02/weirdness_resident_evil_creator_shinji_mikami_got_a_copy_of_willow_on_the_nes_when_he_joined_capcom|title=Weirdness: Resident Evil Creator Shinji Mikami Got A Copy Of Willow On The NES When He Joined Capcom|date=2014-02-06|website=Nintendo Life|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926143550/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/02/weirdness_resident_evil_creator_shinji_mikami_got_a_copy_of_willow_on_the_nes_when_he_joined_capcom|archive-date=2017-09-26|url-status=live}}</ref>
