'''''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''''', released in Japan as {{nihongo foot|'''''TMNT: Super Kame Ninja'''''|T.M.N.T. 〜スーパー亀忍者〜|TMNT: Sūpā Kame Ninja|lit. "TMNT: Super Turtle Ninja"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} and in Europe as '''''Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles''''', is a 1989 [[beat 'em up]] [[arcade game]] released by [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Every Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Game By Konami (1989-2005) Review - Dubious Gaming - Blog by Ledjar |website=[[IGN]] |url=http://ca.ign.com/blogs/ledjar/2014/01/13/every-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-game-by-konami-1989-2005-review-dubious-gaming |access-date=2021-08-03 |archive-date=2017-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926101209/http://ca.ign.com/blogs/ledjar/2014/01/13/every-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-game-by-konami-1989-2005-review-dubious-gaming |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is based on the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' franchise, including the first [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|animated series]] that began airing two years earlier. In the game, up to four players control the titular Ninja Turtles, fighting through various levels to defeat the turtles' enemies, including [[the Shredder]], [[Krang]] and the [[Foot Clan]]. Released during a high point in popularity for the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' franchise, the arcade game was a worldwide hit, becoming the highest-grossing dedicated [[1990 in video games|arcade game of 1990]] in the United States and Konami's highest-grossing arcade game. Versions for various home systems soon followed, including the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name="HardcoreGaming101">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tmnt/tmnt3.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|website=www.hardcoregaming101.net|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time]]'', was released in 1991.

==Gameplay==
The player chooses from one of the four Ninja Turtles: [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]]. Depending on the version of the game, the characters are either chosen via an in-game select screen or based on which coin slot the player placed their credit into. After [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] kidnaps the Turtles' friend [[April O'Neil]] and their mentor [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], they must give chase, save their comrades, and defeat the evil Shredder. Up to four players (two in some versions) can take control of any of the Turtles. Donatello has slower attacks but a longer range, Michelangelo and Raphael have faster attacks but a shorter range, and Leonardo is a well-rounded Turtle with average range and speed.

The eight-way joystick controls the movements of the Turtle, the jump button makes them jump and the attack button makes them hit in front of them using their weapon. The Turtles can also perform special moves, including throwing Foot soldiers overhead and performing a special attack by pressing the jump and attack buttons; Raphael rolls along the ground and finishes with a kick, while the other Turtles do a sweeping jump attack with their weapons. The Turtles can also spring off the wall in certain areas. Enemies can be defeated more quickly by slamming them into walls or solid objects. Many objects such as traffic cones, parking meters, fire hydrants and exploding oil drums can be hit or damaged with attacks in order to help defeat nearby enemies. In the [[Glossary of video game terms#attract mode|attract mode]], the game shows the first part of the cartoon opening, along with a portion of the ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' theme song.

Most of the enemies the Turtles face are the [[Foot Clan|Foot Soldiers]], all color-coded to indicate their attack patterns and weapon of choices. Some enemies, such as the standard purple-clad Foot Soldiers and Roadkill Rodney robots, have the ability to restrain the Turtles' mobility and drain their health, leaving only the player open to attack for other enemies. The bosses in the game include [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Rocksteady and Bebop]] (individually at first in that order, and later the two of them together), [[Baxter Stockman]] (in his human form), Granitor, General Traag, [[Krang]], and Shredder himself.

In ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection]]'', the Arcade version of ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' has six enhancements.

* '''Level Select''' – Allows the player to start at any level of their choosing.
* '''God Mode''' – Allows the player to become immune to most damage and defeat most enemies with a single hit.
* '''Remove Penalty Bombs''' – This enhancement disables the "Penalty Bombs" that the game drops on players in certain circumstances.
* '''Nightmare Mode''' − Enables a mode in the game that dramatically increases the number of enemies.
* '''Starting Lives''' − Adjusts the number of lives at the start of the game from 1 to 5.
* '''Difficulty''' − Adjusts the difficulty of the game from easy to very difficult.

==Development and release==
[[File:tmntpcb.jpg|left|thumb|A [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) of the arcade game]]

Konami acquired the license for the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' franchise around the same time the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|animated series]] began airing in 1987. Konami began development on both an arcade game and console game shortly after.<ref name="RePlay38">{{cite magazine |title=Voice of the Turtle: operators across the land sing the praises of Konami's mega-hit; Dynamo Corp. joins production line to keep up with huge demand |magazine=RePlay |date=January 1990 |volume=15 |issue=4 |page=38 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-14-issue-no.-4-january-1990-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2014%2C%20Issue%20No.%204%20-%20January%201990/page/38}}</ref>

The arcade game was distributed as ''TMNT: Super Kame Ninja'' in Japan, ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' in North America and Oceania, and ''Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles'' in Europe. The game was released primarily as a dedicated four-player [[arcade cabinet]] in all regions except Japan, where it was sold as a 2-player conversion kit. 2-player conversion kits of the game were released in other regions, serving as less expensive alternatives to 4-player cabinets.

===Ports to home systems===
[[File:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II - The Arcade Game (Nintendo 1990).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cover artwork of the NES version, which was retitled ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game'']]

The game was [[ported]] to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990. This conversion was titled '''''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game''''' in order to avoid confusion with the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES video game)|previous NES game based on the franchise]].<ref name="Gamamustra">{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RonAlpert/20100401/87041/Retro_Game_of_the_Day_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_II_The_Arcade_Game.php|title=Retro Game of the Day! Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref> The Japanese Famicom version was titled ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'', without a number nor a subtitle, due to the fact that first NES game was localized in Japan under a different title.

[[File:TMNT II Snow Level.PNG|thumb|upright|left|The NES version features two additional levels and bosses, one of which is a snowy [[Central Park]] where players fight an alien bounty hunter named "Tora".]]

This version includes two new levels (the first part of Scene 3 and all of Scene 6), which feature new enemy characters, including two new bosses created specifically for the NES port: Tora (a Polar Bear-like "blizzard beast") and Shogun (a robotic samurai). Most of the original stages from the arcade version were extended as well, and the second half of Scene 3, the parking garage stage, replaces the arcade version's end battle with both [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] with a battle against the mutated fly form of [[Baxter Stockman]]. The NES port appeared in [[Nintendo]]'s [[PlayChoice-10]] arcade system.

The NES version featured notable [[product placement]] advertising: [[Pizza Hut]] logos. The rear cover of the instruction manual provided a coupon for the restaurant, with an expiration date of December 31, 1991.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beckerman|first1=Marty|title=A COMPLETE HISTORY OF TMNT PIZZA PRODUCT PLACEMENT|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1877849/ninja-turtles-pizza-hut/|website=MTV.com|access-date=5 February 2017}}</ref>

Computer ports of the arcade game were released by [[Image Works]] and ported by [[Probe Software]] in 1991 for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[IBM PC compatible|DOS PC]] and [[Commodore 64]]. The title was changed to ''Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: The Coin Op'' in the European versions, reflecting [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)#International|censorship of the 1987 TV series]] in certain regions at the time.

===Emulated releases===
An [[emulated]] version of the arcade game is included as a hidden bonus game in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[GameCube]], but with altered music and most of the voice clips edited out. The game is unlocked by finding an antique in Stage 9-1; the antique turns out to be the original arcade machine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-2-battle-nexus/cheats/|title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus Cheats|website=www.gamesradar.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref>

An [[Xbox Live Arcade]] version of the game was released under the name ''TMNT 1989 Classic Arcade'' on March 14, 2007, published by [[Ubisoft]] under license from Konami and ported by [[Digital Eclipse]].<ref name="Gamespot">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-turtles-headed-to-live-arcade/1100-6166850/|title=Ninja Turtles headed to Live Arcade|last=Sinclair|first=Brendan|date=2007-03-06|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref> The game was priced at 400 Microsoft Points.<ref name="Gamespot"/> Like other classic arcade games on the [[Xbox 360]] platform, portions of the original arcade game were emulated with network code and other new features added.  Players could earn achievements as well as play 2-4 player co-op (both online and offline). Unlike the  unlockable in ''Battle Nexus'', this rerelease retains the music and voices of the 1989 arcade game.

In 2019, the game was re-released as a replica [[arcade cabinet]] for home use by manufacturer [[Arcade1Up]].<ref name="IGN Arcade1up">[https://ign.com/articles/2019/12/16/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-arcade1up-cabinet-review IGN]</ref> The reissue is nearly identical to the original, but there are a few changes: the opening theme is a new recording by a different singer, players do not need to insert quarters to play, and Konami's name on the arcade marquee is replaced by [[Nickelodeon]]'s.<ref name="IGN Arcade1up"/>

The arcade and NES versions of the game were re-released as part of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection]]'' in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection Has a Release Date |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-has-a-release-date |last=Bailey |first=Kat |date=July 21, 2022 |access-date=August 29, 2022 |website=IGN}}</ref>
