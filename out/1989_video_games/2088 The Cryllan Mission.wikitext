==Development and release==
''2088: The Cryllan Mission'' was developed by Victory Software, which was composed of brothers Vinay, Vivek, and Vijay Pai. The family moved from [[India]] to [[Houston]] in 1978 and purchased an [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computer in 1981 with a young Vinay quickly learning to code on the machine.<ref name="LinkedIn">{{cite web | author=Carpio, Aliza | date=April 28, 2016 | title=Episode 6: An Interview with Vinay Pai, Vice President of Intuit Develop Group, #technologist who rocks @Intuit | url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/episode-6-interview-vinay-pai-vice-president-intuit-develop-carpio | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240514150719/https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/episode-6-interview-vinay-pai-vice-president-intuit-develop-carpio | archive-date=May 14, 2024 | website=[[LinkedIn]] | accessdate=May 15, 2024}}</ref> The brothers began submitting programs to the [[Apple II]]-centric magazine ''[[Nibble (magazine)|Nibble]]'' in 1982.<ref name="ReviewingReviews">{{cite magazine | author=Pai, Vinay | date=June 1990 | title=Reviewing Reviews | url=https://archive.org/details/1990.06-memory-master/page/n88/mode/1up | magazine=[[Nibble (magazine)|Nibble]] | publisher=MicroSPARC | volume=11 | issue=6 | page=88 | issn=0734-3795 | oclc=421716813}}</ref> Vinay graduated from [[Rice University]] in 1988 with a degree in [[computer science]], first working for [[IBM]] before forming Victory with Vivek and Vijay that same year.<ref name="Rice">{{cite web | author=Rice University Electrical and Computer Engineering | date=November 30, 2020 | title=This self-described 'geek' came to Rice to learn about business, leadership and his career ambitions | url=https://eceweb.rice.edu/news/self-described-geek-came-rice-learn-about-business-leadership-and-his-career-ambitions | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201203135931/https://eceweb.rice.edu/news/self-described-geek-came-rice-learn-about-business-leadership-and-his-career-ambitions | archive-date=December 3, 2020 | publisher=[[Rice University]] | accessdate=May 15, 2024}}</ref> Their company’s name was taken from the ubiquitous brand in the [[George Orwell]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.<ref name="CRPGAddict1">{{cite web | author=Bolingbroke, Chester | date=July 8, 2018 | title=''2088'': Cultural Assumptions | url=https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2018/07/2088-cultural-assumptions.html?m=1 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210324223004/https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2018/07/2088-cultural-assumptions.html?m=1 | archive-date=March 24, 2021 | publisher=The CRPG Addict | accessdate=May 15, 2024}}</ref>

Vinay led the team on the three titles they produced, writing one third of the [[source code|code]] using an [[Apple IIGS|Apple II{{sc|GS}}]], giving [[game demo|demos]], and doing the company's [[cold calling]]. He also penned the manual for ''2088'' and said that they commissioned the cover artwork for $250.<ref name="LinkedIn"/> The team relied on Apple for marketing, believing the II{{sc|GS}} to show immense promise for the future. Vinay later proclaimed that they were committed to the II{{sc|GS}} in what he posited was a time when many companies were abandoning the platform. "Victory Software, however, has written a true II{{sc|GS}} application and, in the process, created a role-playing game with some unconventional features, such as our conversation", he stated.<ref name="ReviewingReviews"/> The game’s design was influenced by the developers' Indian heritage and their interests in [[popular culture]] including ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'', and the ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' series. The repetitive and verbose speech of its NPCs was intended to pad the game’s length and challenge the player to decipher clues to advance.<ref name="CRPGAddict1"/>

''2088'' was released in 1989. The trio spent tens of thousands of dollars on manufacturing about 5,000 full-color game boxes.<ref name="CRPGAddict2">{{cite web | author=Bolingbroke, Chester | date=March 15, 2024 | title=BRIEF: ''2088: The Cryllan Mission'' - The Second Scenario (1990) | url=https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2024/03/brief-cryllan-mission-second-scenario.html?m=1 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240515105105/https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2024/03/brief-cryllan-mission-second-scenario.html?m=1 | archive-date=May 15, 2024 | publisher=The CRPG Addict | accessdate=May 15, 2024}}</ref> They sold the game online, through magazines, and at [[GameStop|Babbage’s]] in [[Dallas]].<ref name="Rice"/> Most of the revenue from its very steep asking price of $69.95 went back into manufacturing and advertising.<ref name="CRPGAddict3">{{cite web | author=Bolingbroke, Chester | date=July 31, 2017 | title=''2088'': Won!

Vinay said in 2016 that he considered the experience "a good failure" in which he learned a lot.<ref name="LinkedIn"/>

==Reception==
Dennis Owens reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Overall, ''2088: The Cryllan Mission'' marks a promising entrance into the still underdeveloped market of II{{sc|GS}}-specific software by a new company."<ref name="CGW71">{{cite magazine |last=Owens |first=Dennis |title=2088: The Cryllan Mission |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=May 1990 |volume=1 |issue=71 |pages=34, 36}}</ref>
