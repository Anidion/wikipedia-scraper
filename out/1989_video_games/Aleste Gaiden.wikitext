{{nihongo foot|'''''Aleste Gaiden'''''|アレスタ外伝|''Aresuta Gaiden''||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1989 [[vertically scrolling shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Compile (company)|Compile]] for the [[MSX|MSX2]] home computer. A follow-up to ''[[Aleste]]'' (1988), it was included as part of the autumn special edition of ''Disc Station'', a monthly disk publication by Compile. It is a sidestory to the main series, taking place in an alternative continuity. Controlling the soldier Raymond Waizen, protagonist of the first game wearing a cybernetic ninja suit, the player must overthrow the supercomputer DIA 51 by fight waves of enemies and bosses, while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles.

''Aleste Gaiden'' is a vertical-scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] game. The plot takes place in an alternative continuity and follows Raymond Waizen, protagonist of the first ''[[Aleste]]'' game, who wears a cybernetic ninja suit codenamed in order to overthrow the supercomputer DIA 51.<ref name="AGhg101"/><ref name="AGum">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/msx-disc-station-special-4-autumn-manual|title= ディスクステーション #SP4 秋号|date=1989|publisher=[[Compile (company)|Compile]]|edition=Japanese|type=取扱説明書}}</ref> Its gameplay differs from the original entry; the player controls Raymond instead of a ship through five increasingly difficult stages over a constantly scrolling background, populated with an assortment of enemy forces and obstacles such as pits that must be avoided by jumping, and the scenery never stops moving until a boss is reached, which must be fought to progress further.<ref name="AGhg101"/><ref name="AGum"/>

Unlike other ''Aleste'' titles, enemies move in a preset formation instead of being determined by an artificial intelligence.<ref name="AGhg101"/> There are three types of [[power-up]]s that can be collected by the player, which come in capsules marked with a chikara symbol, as well as equip Raymond with shadow clones of himself.<ref name="AGhg101"/><ref name="AGum"/> ''Gaiden'' employs a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. However, the player [[respawn]] immediately when fighting a boss.<ref name="AGhg101"/> Getting hit will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing Raymond's firepower to his original state and the [[Game over|game is over]] once all lives are lost.

''Aleste Gaiden''  received a mixture of opinions from reviewers. ''MSX Gids''{{'}} José Herps applauded the graphical production, audio and overally quality.<ref name="MSXGidsAG"/> ''MSX Club''{{'}}s Jesús Manuel Montané and Ramón Casillas expressed similar thoughts about the visuals, addictive factor, pacing and sound, but felt mixed regarding its presentation and originality.<ref name="MSXClubAG"/> ''SHMUPS!'' (a classic network of ''[[GameSpy]]'') stated that "the game isn't all that bad, it just falls in the 'Above Average' category. The fact is that we expect higher quality games from [[Compile (company)|Compile]], and being the worst game in a series that has only fantastic games isn't that a bad thing at all."<ref name="SHMUPS!ag">{{cite web|author=Shatterhand|url=http://shmups.classicgaming.gamespy.com/reviews/aleste3/index.html|title=Reviews: Aleste Gaiden - Compile|work=SHMUPS!|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2007|access-date=2022-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117000137/http://shmups.classicgaming.gamespy.com/reviews/aleste3/index.html|archive-date=2009-01-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[Hardcore Gaming 101]]''{{'}}s Kurt Kalata opined that "Considering ''Aleste Gaiden'' wasn't a full retail release, it's not exactly fair to judge it against the standards of the other games.
