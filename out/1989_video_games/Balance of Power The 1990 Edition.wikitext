'''''Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition''''' is a sequel to the computer strategy game ''[[Balance of Power (video game)|Balance of Power]]''.

==Development==
''Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition'' was released in 1989 on the [[Apple IIGS]], [[Windows]], [[Macintosh]], [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]]. [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] who created both the original ''Balance of Power'' and  ''Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition'' does not consider the latter as a proper sequel, saying he was simply "tidying up, adding some bells and whistles."<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Rouse III |title= Game Design: Theory and Practice, Second Edition |date=August 30, 2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-YhFl6iAGw4C |pages=168–269|isbn=9780763798116 }}</ref> ''Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition'' adds more countries, advisors to help the player, a new "multi-polar" level that allows countries to generate events of their own (such as declaring war on other countries) and a 2-player [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]] mode.

==Reception==
[[Gary Whitta]] for ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' said "An outstanding piece of strategy gaming – especially in two-player mode (even without a modem option). Worthwhile even for those who own the original."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-08|title=TheOne Magazine Issue 08|date=May 4, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Steve Williams for ''[[Family Computing]]'' said "For the new multipolar level alone, I would consider ''The 1990 Edition'' to be a major improvement over the original ''Balance of Power''. The addition of 78 active participants makes it a new game altogether."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/family-computing-64|title=Family Computing Magazine Issue 64|date=December 4, 1988|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

In 1989 ''[[Compute!]]'' stated that the 1990 edition's multipolar features were welcome additions to the game.<ref name="keizer198901">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-01-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_104_1989_Jan#page/n81/mode/2up | title=Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition | work=Compute! |date = January 1989| accessdate=November 10, 2013 | author=Keizer, Gregg | pages=80}}</ref> That year [[Orson Scott Card]] stated that the magazine's 1988 list caused him to reevaluate the game when playing the 1990 edition, stating that it had "the most detailed, carefully extrapolated future world I've worked with". While still criticizing geopolitical "absurdities" such as forcing the United States to passively accept Soviet troops in Syria (contrary to what happened during the [[Yom Kippur War]]) and advisors in Mexico or start nuclear war, Card now concluded that such outcomes probably reflected computer limitations rather than Crawford's political views. He advised players to pretend that ''Balance of Power'' was set on an alien planet "astonishingly similar" to Earth, and to play solely based on the game's assumptions about the world.<ref name="card198906">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-06-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_109_1989_Jun#page/n29/mode/2up | title=Light-years and Lasers / Science Fiction Inside Your Computer | work=Compute! |date = June 1989| accessdate=November 11, 2013 | author=Card, Orson Scott | pages=29}}</ref> [[Chuck Moss]] disagreed with Card's revised view, describing ''Balance of Power'' in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1992 as "reflect[ing] extreme bias on the part of [its] designers". He called it a "pacifist treatise ... nuclear war erupted if the U.S. so much as sent five million dollars to Panama".<ref name="moss199211">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100 | title=Spectrum Holobyte's Crisis in the Kremlin | magazine=Computer Gaming World |date = November 1992| accessdate=4 July 2014 | last=Moss | first=Chuck | authorlink=Chuck Moss | pages=54 | issue=100}}</ref>
