'''''007: Licence to Kill''''' is a 1989 [[video game]] based on the [[James Bond]] [[Licence to Kill|film of the same name]], developed by Quixel and published by [[Domark]] in 1989. It was released for [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]], [[DOS]], [[MSX]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. 

The game's storyline closely follows that of the film, consisting of six scenes in which Bond chases drug czar Sanchez who has murdered his best friend [[Felix Leiter]]'s bride. The scenes within the game vary in setting and include helicopter chases, underwater diving, water-skis and behind the wheel of an 18-wheel tanker truck.

==Gameplay==

''007: Licence to Kill'' is a top down vertical scrolling action shoot-em-up where the objective is for the player to pursue the antagonist (drug lord Sanchez) through six premade levels in a variety of different methods. The right hand side of the screen contains a HUD which displays information about the current level, such as the height of the helicopter in the first level or the amount of ammunition remaining in the second level. Hostile enemies populate each level which can be killed or avoided and there are side objectives along the way such as picking up ammunition or drug caches. The player must dodge shots and environment dangers such as boats or falling rocks.<ref name="MI6" />

==Platforms==
''007: Licence to Kill'' targeted multiple platforms initially and post-release with [[Mi6-HQ.com]] calling it "one of the widest released 007 titles ever."<ref name="MI6-interview">{{cite web|url=https://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/interview_gaming_ltk.php3|publisher=[[Mi6-HQ.com]]|title=Making The Licence To Kill Game |access-date=18 November 2015}}</ref>

Alongside the original versions was another version for BBC, coded by Lore Games who were subcontracted to [[Consul Technology]] who were in turn subcontracted to [[Domark]].<ref name="MI6">{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/games/ltk.php3?s=games|publisher=[[Mi6-HQ.com]]|title=Licence to Kill game info |access-date=9 August 2007}}</ref> It was based largely on the graphics from the Spectrum version, but with a freshly written sprite engine, character 'AI', sound effects and status display.  It featured a [[double buffer]] screen refresh mechanism to eliminate flicker, and was available in [[cassette tape]] and [[floppy disc]] versions.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Another version was being written for [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] by Simon Nicol from [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]]. Christ West from Quixel inspected this version after the others had been completed and considered it finished despite missing the final level, but it went unreleased as by that point the Domark publishers felt that too much time had passed since the film's release and so the NES version would not be worth releasing.<ref name="MI6-interview" />

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' only recommended ''007: Licence to Kill'' "''strictly'' for the action-oriented player", with others likely finding it a "license to bore".<ref name="choi199001">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=67 | title=Nobody Does It Better | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=January 1990 | access-date=15 November 2013 | author=Choi, Yung Min | pages=52 | issue=67}}</ref> ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE Magazine]]'' considered it "fun while it lasts, but once you've cracked it you won't bother to come back."<ref name="ACE">{{cite journal |last=Lacey |first=Eugene |date=September 1989 |title=Licence to Kill |journal=ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment) |url=https://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-24/ACE_Issue_24_1989_Sep#page/n53/mode/1up |access-date=18 November 2015}}</ref> ''[[The Games Machine]]'' was more positive, saying ''Licence to Kill'' was designed "on a grand scale" and that it "follow[s] the film quite well, albeit with scenes simplified to shoot-'em-up and dodge games."<ref name="GamesMachine">{{cite journal |date=October 1989 |title=Licence to Kill |journal=The Games Machine UK |url=https://archive.org/stream/the-games-machine-21/TheGamesMachine21#page/n98/mode/1up |access-date=18 November 2015}}</ref> Both ''Games Machine'' and Amiga magazine ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' agreed that it was an improvement on ''Domark's'' previous three games, with ''The One'' calling it "...probably the best Bond game ever. Not only did it successfully capture the spirit of the film, it was also an enjoyable game to boot."<ref name="GamesMachine" /><ref name="OneAmiga">{{cite journal |date=June 1991 |title=Licence to Kill |journal=The One |url=https://archive.org/stream/TheOneIssue33Jun91/The_One_Issue_33_Jun_91#page/n110/mode/1up|access-date=18 November 2015}}</ref>
