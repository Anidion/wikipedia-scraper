==Gameplay==
''Universe 3'' is a game in which the player is the captain of a starship assigned to a diplomatic mission.<ref name="CGW64"/>

==Reception==
Douglas Seacat reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Frankly, ''Universe III'' is not as good as its most recent predecessors (''Breach'' and ''Paladin''). Where its predecessors demonstrated flexibility and depth, ''Universe III'' is rigid and narrow. Those who have played ''Universe'' and ''Universe II'' will want to play this game to continue the series and some Amiga and IBM owners will want to play the game as a diversion. Nevertheless, one cannot help but have the feeling that ''Universe III'' is not what Omnitrend was shooting for."<ref name="CGW64">{{cite magazine |last=Seacat |first=Douglas |title=Universe In A Bucket: Omnitrend's "Universe III" |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1989 |volume=1 |issue=64 |pages=20, 22}}</ref>
