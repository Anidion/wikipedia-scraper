{{nihongo|'''''Cyber Police ESWAT'''''|サイバーポリス イースワット}} is a [[side-scrolling]] [[run and gun video game]] developed and released by [[Sega]] for [[arcade video game|arcades]] in 1989. Players take control of Duke Oda, a member of the Liberty City Cyber Police Force tasked with finding and arresting the city's most wanted criminals, and eventually dismantling a terrorist organization planning world domination. In 1990, Sega released a [[Mega Drive/Genesis]] version known in North America as ''[[ESWAT: City Under Siege]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ESWAT.png|thumb|left|In the arcade game's first stage, players start out as a regular police officer.]]

The gameplay is similar to Sega's own ''[[Shinobi (1987 video game)|Shinobi]]'' (1987),<ref name="VT">{{cite magazine |title=Pedal To The Metal: Sega Set To Speed, Swing, Sidekick Into The 1990s With New Fall Line |magazine=[[Vending Times]] |date=August 1989 |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=52–5 |url=https://archive.org/details/VendingTimesVOL29NO10August1989Clearscan/page/n47}}</ref> as the player has the ability to jump up and down between planes where possible. The goal of each of the game's 15 stages is to find and arrest a specific wanted criminal, who is usually fought at the end of the stage as a boss. Duke is initially armed with only a single-shot pistol, but upon arresting the first three criminals and being promoted to ESWAT, Duke is equipped with a Power Suit with a mounted machine gun for the rest of the game. The suit also has access to limited-use special weapons which can be found within stages. However, both of Duke's standard weapons require ammunition, without which the player can only attack with a kick. Additional ammunition can be found in boxes throughout each stage.

==Hardware/conversion==
The game was issued on [[Sega]]'s [[System 16|System 16-B]] which is built around the M68000 and uses a Z80 and a YM2151 for amplified mono sound generation. The System 16 pinout is not [[JAMMA]] compatible but JAMMA adaptors are available and fairly common. The game was released in a dedicated two player cabinet and also as a kit that contained the System 16 to JAMMA adaptor. Each player requires one start [[Push-button|button]], one [[joystick]], and three action buttons (shoot, jump, special weapons). This game utilizes a standard resolution arcade monitor.

==Reception==
''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called the game a cross between ''[[NARC (video game)|NARC]]'' and ''[[RoboCop (1988 video game)|RoboCop]]'', but wrote that it "doesn't quite have the flair of either". Rating the game at 76% overall, they recommended only playing ''Cyber Police'' if they were bored with the two other games.<ref name=CVG>"Cyber Police". ''Computer and Video Games''.
