'''''Muppet Adventure: Chaos at the Carnival''''' is a [[video game]] released for the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[MS-DOS]] in 1989 by [[Hi Tech Expressions]]. It was ported to [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990. The game features [[The Muppets|Muppets]] created by [[Jim Henson]] in a series of carnival-inspired mini games searching for enough keys to rescue [[Miss Piggy]] from Dr. Grump. These mini games include: Bumper Cars, Funhouse, Tunnel of Love, Duck Hunt and Space Ride. The game was initially released for the [[Apple IIc]] with a bug which caused it to be unwinnable.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Upon achieving the win condition versus Dr. Grump, the game would enter an endless cycle of taking the player back to a previous level, instead of having Dr. Grump be defeated.

==NES port==
The NES version of the game is unique from its computer counterparts in that it has on-screen hearts designating hit detection, but eliminates the two-player mode. The player is required to complete each level with a specific character. The initial levels, which you can complete in any order, are as follows;

[[Kermit the Frog]] rides an inner tube down a river, [[Fozzie Bear]] must escape a Fun House of desserts, [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] flies a spaceship and [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] drives a bumper car. After completing these initial levels, the player then controls Kermit the Frog, armed with a feather, in Dr. Grump's castle.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Muppet Adventure: Chaos at the Carnival (NES) review |url=https://www.honestgamers.com/1453/nes/muppet-adventure-chaos-at-the-carnival/review.html |access-date=2023-06-13 |website=www.honestgamers.com}}</ref>
