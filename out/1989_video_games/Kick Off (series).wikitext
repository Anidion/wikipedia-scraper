The '''''Kick Off''''' franchise is a series of football simulation [[video game]]s created by [[Dino Dini]]. ''Kick Off'' was published by Anil Gupta's publishing house Anco Software for the [[Atari ST]] and Commodore [[Amiga]]. First released in 1989, ''[[#Kick Off|Kick Off]]'' was well-received and won awards.

After the release of Kick Off several sequels were released. ''[[Player Manager]]'' was released in 1990. The game was the first game to combine a management environment (including tactics, league play, transfers, and detailed player attributes) with a football game engine (based on that of ''Kick Off''). ''[[#Kick Off|Kick Off 2]]'' was released in 1990 as a sequel to ''Kick Off''. The game introduced a number of new features as well as several small alterations.

In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]], which released ''[[Dino Dini's Goal|Goal!]]'' in 1993. Anco released several further editions of the Kick Off series between 1994 and 1997, but these games had little in common with ''Kick Off'' and ''Kick Off 2''. In 2001–2003, the KOA collaborated closely with Anco developer Steve Screech in an attempt to relaunch the ''Kick Off'' and ''Player Manager'' series. Kick Off 2002 was released. Anco started to work on another sequel Kick Off 2004 which reached beta status. The attempt came to a halt when Anco closed in 2003.

==History==
''Kick Off'' was released in 1989. ''Kick Off'' was first developed for the Atari ST and then ported to the Amiga.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/kick-off |title=Kick Off for Amiga (1989) |publisher=MobyGames |access-date=2016-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413110907/http://www.mobygames.com/game/kick-off |archive-date=2016-04-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> Several expansion disks were released for ''Kick Off 2''. In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for Virgin Games, which released ''Goal!'' in 1993. Anco released ''Kick Off 3'' in 1994. The game used a side view instead of a top-down view and bore little resemblance to ''Kick Off 2'' apart from the name. [[Anco Software]] published the first versions of ''Kick Off'' for the Amiga and Atari ST.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6100674.html |title=Soccer deal for Dino Dini and DC-Studios - GameSpot.com |website=www.gamespot.com |access-date=2 February 2022 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525002329/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6100674.html |archive-date=25 May 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:ST Kick Off.png|thumb|[[Atari ST]] gameplay of ''Kick Off''|left|200px]]
With ''Kick Off'' the ball did not stick to the player's feet but instead was realistically kicked ahead from the players, in a manner similar to that of Nintendo's ''[[Soccer (1985 video game)|Soccer]]'', released in 1985 on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]. This added a [[degree of difficulty]] and skill requirement at the same time. Other attributes, such as action replays, players with different characteristics, different tactics, fouls, yellow cards, red cards, injuries, injury time and various referees with different moods also featured.

==Sequels==
===''Player Manager''===
{{main|Player Manager}}

===''Kick Off 2''===
In 1990, ''Kick Off 2'' was released by Anco. ''Kick Off 2'' retains the pace and accuracy of ''Kick Off'', with a full size multi directional scrolling pitch and the players, markings, goals etc., in correct proportions. Both teams play the game strictly according to tactics. Players move into position to receive passes and gain possession. The ball, as in real game, travels ahead of the player.

There is a league and a cup tournament with sudden death penalty shoot outs, in case of a draw. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but with different styles of play and the player skills to match, that style. There is an option to load your own team from "[[Player Manager]]" along with your own tactics, to play against another "[[Player Manager]]" team in a single game or enter league and cup tournament.

The special events selection in the main menu allows data disks to be loaded. ''Kick Off 2'' also provides the facility to change strip colours and on expanded Atari ST's (1 MB or above) there are additional sound effects. The "Action Replay" facility allows goals to be viewed at normal pace or in "Slow Motion" and saved to disk. There are 24 referees and have their own distinctive temperaments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/kick-off-2 |title=Kick Off 2 for Amiga (1990) |publisher=MobyGames |access-date=2016-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413112623/http://www.mobygames.com/game/kick-off-2 |archive-date=2016-04-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===''Super Kick Off''===
''Super Kick Off'' is one of the follow-ups of ''Kick Off'' and ''[[#Sequels|Kick Off 2]]'' for the [[Master System]], [[Game Boy]], [[Mega Drive]], and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name="mobygames1">{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/super-kick-off |title=Super Kick Off for Game Boy (1991) |publisher=MobyGames |date=2007-11-23 |access-date=2016-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019011847/http://www.mobygames.com/game/super-kick-off |archive-date=2016-10-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Super Kick Off'' was slower than the original games.<ref name="mobygames1"/> The Mega Drive version knocked ''[[PGA Tour Golf II]]'' from the top of the charts.<ref>Official Gallup UK Mega Drive sales chart, July 1993, published in [[Mega (magazine)]] issue 10</ref> ''[[MegaTech]]'' gave the game 94% and a Hyper Game Award, saying that the "feel and playability is unrivalled by any other footy game so far", but criticising the high price of £45.<ref>MegaTech rating, [[EMAP]], issue 15</ref>

===''Goal!''===
{{main|Dino Dini's Goal}}
In 1992, a sequel, ''Kick Off 3'', was in development. The game wasn't released in this form though, as Dino Dini left Anco in 1992 for [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]], where he developed ''[[Dino Dini's Goal|Goal!]]'', released in 1993. ''Goal!'' featured similar gameplay to ''Kick Off 2'' but also added one-touch passing as seen in ''[[Sensible Soccer (series)|Sensible Soccer]]'', player acceleration, and more advanced menu systems and options. ''Goal!'' received generally good reviews but did not enjoy the same lasting popularity as ''Kick Off 2''.

===''Kick Off 3'' {{anchor|k3}}===
In 1994, Anco released ''Kick Off 3'' developed by Steve Screech, a totally new game with nothing in common with ''[[Kick Off 2]]''. The game didn't receive as good reviews as its predecessors and didn't gain the same popularity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/kick-off-3 |title=Kick Off 3 for Amiga (1994) |publisher=MobyGames |access-date=2016-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019002339/http://www.mobygames.com/game/kick-off-3 |archive-date=2016-10-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> An [[Atari Jaguar]] port was in development but never released.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Computer%20&%20Video%20Games/CVG%20(1994-03)%20148%20(EMAP).pdf/#page/114|title=Next Month - It's Kick Off 3!|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=148|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=March 1994|page=114|access-date=2019-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912130920/http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Computer%20%26%20Video%20Games/CVG%20%281994-03%29%20148%20%28EMAP%29.pdf/#page/114|archive-date=2018-09-12|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Computer%20&%20Video%20Games/CVG%20(1994-04)%20149%20(EMAP).pdf/#page/22|title=Work In Progress - Kick Off 3|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=149|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=April 1994|pages=22–24|access-date=2019-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918090953/http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Computer%20%26%20Video%20Games/CVG%20%281994-04%29%20149%20%28EMAP%29.pdf/#page/22|archive-date=2018-09-18|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Player%20One/playerone_numero041/Player%20One%20n%B041%20%28Avril%201994%29%20-%20Page%20014.jpg|title=Stop Info - Grand foot-oire de printemps sur consoles! - Kick Off 3|magazine=[[:fr:Player One (magazine)|Player One]]|issue=41|publisher=[[:fr:Média Système Édition|Média Système Édition]]|date=April 1994|page=14|lang=fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Rand|first=Paul|url=http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Computer%20&%20Video%20Games/CVG%20(1994-05)%20150%20(EMAP).pdf/#page/68|title=CVG Review - Kick Off 3 (SNES)|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=150|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=May 1994|pages=68–69|access-date=2019-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912130928/http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Computer%20%26%20Video%20Games/CVG%20%281994-05%29%20150%20%28EMAP%29.pdf/#page/68|archive-date=2018-09-12|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Skews|first=Rik|url=http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Computer%20&%20Video%20Games/CVG%20(1994-06)%20151%20(EMAP).pdf/#page/58|title=CVG Review - Kick Off 3 (Mega Drive)|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=151|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=June 1994|page=59|access-date=2019-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912130917/http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Computer%20%26%20Video%20Games/CVG%20%281994-06%29%20151%20%28EMAP%29.pdf/#page/58|archive-date=2018-09-12|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_59#page/n124/mode/1up|title=Kick Off 3 - A Whole New Ball Game|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=59|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=June 1994|page=125}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AMegaFun_DE_1994-06.pdf&page=16|title=Special - Release Schedule ECTS-Messe|magazine=[[:de:Mega Fun|Mega Fun]]|issue=21|publisher=[[:de:Computec Media Group|CT Computec Verlag GmbH & Co.

====''Kick Off 96, 97 & 98''====
In 1996, Toka Nono released ''Kick Off 96'' for Amiga and Windows. The game received average reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/kick-off-96 |title=Kick Off 96 for Amiga (1996) |publisher=MobyGames |date=2001-08-13 |access-date=2016-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619053004/http://www.mobygames.com/game/kick-off-96 |archive-date=2016-06-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1997, ''[[Kick Off 97]]'' was released for Windows.

===''Kick Off 2002''===
In 2001, Steve Screech started a project called ''Ultimate Kick Off'' with the help of an early established Kick Off Association. The game was built using the [[Gamebryo]] engine,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamebryo.com/titles.php | title=Gamebryo }}</ref> released by Anco in 2002 for [[Personal computer|PC]]  and [[Mac OS|Mac]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/games/articles/2002/10/kickoff/ |title=Games - Articles - Kick Off 2002 |publisher=Apple |date=1999-04-05 |access-date=2009-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206032038/https://www.apple.com/games/articles/2002/10/kickoff/ |archive-date=2009-02-06 |url-status=live }}</ref> with the name ''Kick Off 2002''.

It reached beta status but it was never released. The project ended when Anco closed in 2003.

===''Kick Off Revival''===
In the end of 2015, Dino Dini announced that he was working on a new entry in the series, with a control system designed for the use with an [[analog stick]]. ''Kick Off Revival'' was released on June 24, 2016 exclusively for [[PlayStation 4]] with poor reviews from the main game websites,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/kick-off-revival-review-why-does-this-game-even-exist/|title=Kick off Revival review: Why does this game even exist?|date=5 July 2016|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421093728/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/kick-off-revival-review-why-does-this-game-even-exist/|archive-date=2017-04-21|url-status=live}}</ref>  A delayed [[PlayStation Vita]] version was released nine months later in 2017<ref name="revival">{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamefaqs.com/vita/182187-dino-dinis-kick-off-revival/data |title=GameFAQs |access-date=2017-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421092426/https://www.gamefaqs.com/vita/182187-dino-dinis-kick-off-revival/data |archive-date=2017-04-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> with bad reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dino Dini Kick Off Revival PS Vita reviews|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/dino-dinis-kick-off-revival/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-vita|website=Metacritic|access-date=7 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915140503/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/dino-dinis-kick-off-revival|archive-date=2017-09-15|url-status=live}}</ref> A PC version is available on Steam.
