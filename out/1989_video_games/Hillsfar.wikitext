'''''Hillsfar''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] for [[MS-DOS]] compatible operating systems, [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[Commodore 64]]. It was developed by [[Westwood Associates]] and published by [[Strategic Simulations]] in 1989. It combines real-time action with randomly generated quests and includes elements of the ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' fantasy [[role-playing game]]. A port to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] was released in 1993. ''Hillsfar'' received mixed reviews from critics.

==Gameplay==
Players start their game by creating a character. The game provides three choices: players may select a pre-made character, create their own,<ref name="Orr1989">{{cite magazine | last = Orr | first = Lucinda | title = Hillsfar: The bitterest hill is hard to take | date = December 1, 1989 | magazine = [[Amiga Computing]] | pages = 42–43|url=https://archive.org/details/amiga-computing-magazine-019/page/n41/mode/2up|publisher=Database|volume=2|issue=7}}</ref> or import characters from  previous [[Strategic Simulations]] Dungeons & Dragons computer games, such as ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'' and ''[[Curse of the Azure Bonds]]''.<ref name="Lynch1989">{{cite news | last = Lynch | first = Dennis | date = June 2, 1989 | title = CES Gems Not Here Yet, But These Titles Will Tide You Over | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | page = 58 }}</ref> When creating a character, players may determine the character's race (dwarf, elf, human or gnome), [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (cleric, fighter, magic-user or thief), and [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]]. Various characteristics of the new character, such as [[Statistic (role-playing games)|strength and intelligence]], are assigned a random value by the computer.<ref name="Guerra1988">{{cite news | last = Guerra | first = Bob | title = Hillsfar | date = September 1, 1988 | work = [[COMPUTE!]] | pages = 67 }}</ref>

[[File:AD&D Hillsfar Cave.png|left|thumb|The [[first-person perspective]] gameplay of ''Hillsfar'', when the player explores caves]]
There are two aspects to the game: [[action game|arcade]] action, where the player performs tasks (expressed as [[Minigame|mini-game]]s) such as searching for treasure and traveling between locations, and [[adventure game|adventure]], where the player completes quests.<ref name="Smith1998">{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Andy | title = Hillsfar | date = December 1, 1989 | work = [[Amiga Format]] | page = 41 }}</ref> The choice of character class affects the available quests, with three for each class. While the quests need to be completed in a set order, "what you do in your time off is up to you", and thus the player is free to explore other aspects of the game.<ref name="Orr1989" />

The game is presented in three modes. When traveling, the scene is presented using a side-on view; once in the town of Hillsfar, the game converts to a "[[bird's-eye view]]" of the map; a [[First person (video games)|first-person perspective]] is employed within the caves. Interaction is handled through what Leslie Eiser of ''[[Compute!]]'' magazine described as a "bump interface", which allows the player to trigger interaction with objects by bumping into them.<ref name="Fiser1990">{{cite magazine| last = Eiser | first = Leslie | title = Games Kids Love to Read | date = November 1990 | magazine = [[Compute!]] | issue = 8 | volume = 12 | pages = 81–82|publisher= COMPUTE Publications International|url=https://archive.org/details/1990-11-compute-magazine/page/n81/mode/2up}}</ref>

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=August 2018}}
The game takes place in the fictional town of Hillsfar. There are guilds for each class; Fighter, Cleric, Mage, and Thief. Depending on the class chosen by the player during their character's creation, the player must go to the appropriate guildmaster, who assigns them several missions. Upon completing all missions issued by the guildmaster, they will increase the player's gold and [[experience point]]s, and the character then retires.

''Hillsfar'' was successful for SSI, selling 78,418 copies.<ref name="maher20170331">{{Cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2017/03/opening-the-gold-box-part-5-all-that-glitters-is-not-gold/ |title=Opening the Gold Box, Part 5: All That Glitters is Not Gold |last=Maher |first=Jimmy |date=2017-03-31 |website=The Digital Antiquarian}}</ref> Reviews tended to be mixed. On the positive side, the combination of arcade action and adventure was generally well received. Andy Smith of ''[[Amiga Format]]'', in giving the game a rating of 72%, stated that SSI succeeded in producing "a good game that is a distinct mix of two very different styles",<ref name="Smith1998" /> while Bob Guerra of ''[[Compute!]]'' magazine praised the arcade-style sequences, writing that ''Hillsfar'' "does a much better job of integrating these high-quality sequences into the story than many others do".<ref name="Guerra1988" /> Roe Adams of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave much praise for the thief's lockpicking sequence, but noted the game otherwise failed to live up to expectations; in particular, Adams criticized both the repetitive horseback travel sequence, and the fact that magic-users and clerics cast no magic during the game.<ref name="CGW"/>

Other reviewers were less impressed with the overall effect. Lucinda Orr of ''[[Amiga Computing]]'' criticized the overall gameplay, while she was impressed with some of the mini–games, describing them as "quite entertaining and graphically effective", she found the game generally boring, writing, "there is not too much to keep the interest above critical boredom level".<ref name="Orr1989" />

The game was reviewed in 1989 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' No. 147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in their "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game three out of five stars.  The reviewers compared ''Hillsfar'' to ''[[Pool of Radiance]]''. They felt that the adventure of ''Hillsfar'' lacked depth and was less absorbing than ''Pool of Radiance'', but they considered it "a nice adventure to while away the hours while waiting for SSI to release [the sequel to ''Pool of Radiance'' nicknamed] ''[[Curse of the Azure Bonds|Azure Bonds]]''". The reviewers also concluded that "If you enjoyed ''Pool of Radiance'', you'll like ''Hillsfar''".<ref name="Dragon147">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk|journal=Dragon|issue=147|date=July 1989|pages=76–83|url=https://archive.org/stream/DragonMagazine260_201801/DragonMagazine147#page/n79/mode/2up}}</ref>

The NES version was more negatively received. Brent Walker's review in ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'' assessed, "The majority of your time is spent gathering gold, which has limited use, and either picking locks or bashing them open. There is also little adventure or strategy required, and I felt more like I was just wading through the game, rather than being pulled into it. Graphically unexciting and mentally uninteresting, I can't find anything in particular to recommend it." The magazine's team of four editors gave it an average score of 4 out of 10.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Brent|last=Walker |title=Hillsfar |magazine=[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]] |issue=52|publisher=L.F.P., Inc.|date=May 1993|page=51 |url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Computer_Entertainment_Issue_52_May_1993}}</ref>

According to ''[[GameSpy]]'', ''Hillsfar'' was considered "a failed experiment" by a lot of players.<ref name="rausch04">{{cite web | first=Allen | last=Rausch | date=August 15, 2004 | title=A History of D&D Video Games | website=GameSpy | publisher=IGN|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538865p4.html | access-date=2009-12-23|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040817225954/http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538865p4.html|archive-date=August 17, 2004}}</ref>
