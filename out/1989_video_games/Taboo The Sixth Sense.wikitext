'''''Taboo: The Sixth Sense''''' is a tarot card reading simulation developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Tradewest]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1989.

This video game gives users a [[tarot]] reading where the "dealer" automatically shuffles the cards. It is the only NES game to carry two warnings: that it is intended for players ages fourteen and older and the game is intended for entertainment purposes only. ''Taboo'' was marketed as a [[party video game|party game]] that multiple adults could enjoy simultaneously.<ref name="allgame">{{cite web| url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14903| title = Basic game overview| publisher = [[allgame]]| access-date = 2011-12-27| archive-date = 2014-11-14| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141114195840/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14903| url-status = dead}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Upon loading, the game requires input of the player's name, birth date, and gender.<ref name="allgame"/> The game then asks the user to input a question, and shuffles the cards.<ref name="allgame"/> The game then generates a [[tarot]] reading via the [[Tarot Reading|Celtic cross]] layout. These cards can be normal or reversed.  Afterward, the player chooses a state from the United States and is given [[lottery]] numbers accordingly. The game uses the whole 78-card tarot deck, which consists of the [[Minor Arcana]] and [[Major Arcana]].

The instruction booklet gives a brief history of the origins of the word "Tarot".<ref name="allgame"/> The booklet also lists the arcana and cards, and goes into further detail of the layout, including what each position on the Celtic cross means. There is no actual game activity to be found apart from repeated readings. The game contains nudity and religious images, which were usually unacceptable under Nintendo of America's content guidelines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
