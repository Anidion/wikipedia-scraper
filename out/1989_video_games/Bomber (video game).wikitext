'''''Bomber''''', also known as '''''Bomber 3''''' or '''''Bomber III''''', is a [[combat flight simulation game]] developed and released in 1989 by Inline Design for the [[Macintosh]].

==Plot==
The player commands a [[B-17]] crew to perform bombing missions over Europe during [[World War II]], in which hazards include German fighter attacks, [[flak]], and oxygen and heat becoming depleted, while victorious assignments provide rank and rating promotions.<ref name="Dragon158"/> The game starts when the Base Commander's Headquarters assigns the player a bombing run.<ref name="Dragon158"/> Upon successfully bombing 25 targets, the bomber returns home to the US and receives a medal.<ref name="Dator"/>

==Gameplay==
The player controls the pilot, co-pilot, bombardier, navigator, and gunners for the plane. As the bombardier, the player uses the included Photo Recon booklet (which is also the game's copy protection) to aim the bombsight over the landscape to locate the target seen in the photo, pressing the salvo button to release a bomb.<ref name="Dragon158"/> When attacked by fighters, the player controls a gunner at one of the bomber's six gun positions each armed with twin 50-caliber machine guns.<ref name="Dragon158"/> Personnel can be killed during a mission.<ref name="Dragon158"/>

==Development==
''Bomber'', also known by the full title of ''Bomber 3: Flak Alley'', was developed by [[Inline Design]] using [[HyperCard]] as a software environment.<ref name="Dragon158"/> Darryl Peck had started Inline Design with an old friend, intending the company to be a design firm for furniture and yachts.<ref name="Inline"/> When he found out that a friend of his partner was finishing ''Bomber'' and intended to post it as sharewere, Peck says "I convinced him to let me publish it by saying that if we sold 5,000 copies we would have about $100,000 in return. He bought the proposal and off we went. Rather than start a new company, I used the Inline Design name we had already registered."<ref name="Inline"/> Before long, Inline Design had sold over 10,000 copies of ''Bomber''.<ref name="Inline">{{Cite web|url=http://tidbits.com/article/1083|title = InterviewBITS with Darryl Peck, Part 1 of 2|date = 25 March 1996 |work=[[Tidbits]] | last=Engst |first=Adam C. |authorlink=Adam C. Engst |publisher=TidBITS Publishing Inc.}}</ref> ''Bomber'' was Inline Design's biggest selling title in 1991 but Inline Design decided to discontinue selling the game that year because Peck was a pacifist and he felt the game promoted violence; he wanted his business to succeed by publishing "entertaining, challenging, non-violent games."<ref>{{cite news |title=Dropping the Bomber |department=Northeast |work=[[Hartford Courant]] |page=5 |date=1992-03-08 |last=Longley |first=Anne }}</ref>

==Reception==
The Macintosh IIx (B&W) version of the game was reviewed in 1990 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #158 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon158">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk|journal=Dragon|issue=158|date=June 1990|pages=47â€“48}}</ref> They stated that "Inline Design proves that HyperCard ... can be used as a software environment for commercially viable entertainment."<ref name="Dragon158"/> They commented that ''Bomber'' combines digitized sound with realistic graphics, and "has the look and feel of real bomber missions.<ref name="Dragon158"/> The Lessers concluded by stating: "''Bomber'' is extremely enjoyable and is recommended for all Macintosh gamers."<ref name="Dragon158"/>

Markus Dahlberg reviewed ''Bomber'' for Swedish magazine ''[[:sv:Datormagazin|Datormagazin]]'' in 1994.<ref name="Dator">{{cite journal |last=Dahlberg |first=Markus |title=''Bomber'' |url=http://amr.abime.net/review_34901 |journal=[[:sv:Datormagazin|Datormagazin]] |language=Swedish |volume=1994 |number=8 |date=April 1994 |page=13}}</ref> Dahlberg felt that the game did not fulfill any sort of demand a player could expect from a modern game at that time, stating that he had never seen such a lousy game before. He commented that the graphics looked like they were made on a lunch break, and the cockpit looked like a miserable jumble where it would be hard to find which buttons to push. He noted that the game included headphones which hinted at the importance of sound in the game, but that the game's sound was completely inaudible. He ultimately lamented that no one should ever have to play such a miserable game, and felt bad for everyone who happened to own it.<ref name="Dator"/>

[[Macworld]] inducted ''Bomber'' into its 1990 Game Hall of Fame in the Best Simulation category. Macworld called the game "a fascinating HyperCard re-creation of air warfare in the European theater of World War II" that alternated "periods of relative calm [...] with white-knuckled terror".<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Steven Levy |url=https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_9012_December_1990/page/n227/mode/2up |last=Levy |first=Steven |title=Game Hall of Fame |journal=[[Macworld]] |date=December 1990 |volume=7 |number=12 |page=212}}</ref>
