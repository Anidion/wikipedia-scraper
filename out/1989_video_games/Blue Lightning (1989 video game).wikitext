'''''Blue Lightning''''' is a 1989 [[Combat flight simulation game|combat flight simulation video game]] developed by [[Epyx]] and published by [[Atari Corporation]] in North America and Europe for the [[Atari Lynx]].

Assuming the role of a chosen [[rookie]] [[aircraft pilot]] from the [[United States Air Force]] by the Flight Command [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]], the player takes control of the titular prototype [[fighter aircraft]] in a desperate attempt of [[The Pentagon]] to penetrate multiple enemy territories and aid the allies in order to win the war against the enemies. Conceived as a commission to create a [[pseudo-3D]] combat flight game by Landrum and [[Video game artist|graphic artist]] Arthur Koch, ''Blue Lightning'' was heavily inspired by [[Sega]]'s 1987 [[Sega Super Scaler|Super Scaler]] [[arcade game]] ''[[After Burner]]'', in addition of also bearing similarity with the feature film and TV series ''[[Blue Thunder]]''.<ref name="RG152">{{cite magazine|last=Hawken|first=Kieren|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-making-of-blue-lightning/|title=The Making Of: Blue Lightning|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=152|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=March 2016|pages=52–55|access-date=2019-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403201925/https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-making-of-blue-lightning/|archive-date=2017-04-03|url-status=live}}</ref>

Upon its release, ''Blue Lightning'' was well received by critics who praised the visuals, gameplay and for being a showcase of the capabilities of the Lynx, although some criticized the lack of in-game music and repetitive nature of the missions, with many also comparing it with ''After Burner''. In 1995, a [[Blue Lightning (1995 video game)|remake]] developed by [[Attention to Detail]], was released as one of the [[pack-in game]]s for the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] [[Video game accessory#Add-ons/Peripherals|peripheral]] when it launched and received mixed reviews.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:LYNX Blue Lightning.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]
''Blue Lightning'' is an [[Arcade game|arcade-style]] combat flight simulation game that is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third person view games|third-person perspective]] similar to ''After Burner'', where the player take the role of a [[fighter pilot]] with one main objective; to enter into enemy territory and aid the allies in defeating the enemies to claim victory of the war by completing a series of nine missions, each one taking place in various locations and tasking the player with different assignments, while increasing in difficulty as the game progress further.<ref name="BLmanual">''Blue Lightning'' game manual (Atari Lynx, US)</ref><ref name="AEXbl">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.atarimania.com/mags/pdf/Atari_Explorer_January_February_1991.pdf|title=Entertainment: Lynx - Blue Lightning|magazine=Atari Explorer|publisher=[[Atari Corporation]]|date=February 1991|pages=63–64|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref> The game grants the player with a fleet of six Blue Lightning planes, which act as lives and if the current plane is crashed or destroyed, the mission must be restarted from the beginning and the [[Game over|game is over]] once all lives are lost.<ref name="BLmanual"/> The plane also comes equipped with a limited number of missiles to use against enemies but once they run out, the player must rely upon its machine gun to destroy enemy planes.<ref name="BLmanual"/><ref name="AEXbl"/>

== Development and release ==
[[File:Atari-Lynx-I-Handheld.jpg|thumb|right|''After Burner'' served as a source of inspiration for ''Blue Lightning'' during its development process, which originated as a commission to create a combat flight title for the Atari Lynx.]]
''Blue Lightning'' was conceived by Arthur Koch and Stephen Landrum as part of a commission to design a pseudo-3D combat flight title for the then-upcoming Handy [[handheld game console]], which would be later rechristened as the Atari Lynx.<ref name="RG152"/> During their free time, the team would visit local arcades as sources of inspirations for their upcoming projects, among them being Sega's ''After Burner'', which served as a basis for their combat flight game and although Landrum was initially influenced by [[Spectrum HoloByte]]'s ''[[Falcon (video game)|Falcon]]'', Koch lean towards a more arcade-style approach rather than a full simulation one.<ref name="RG152"/> Koch stated that Landrum's first idea for the project was of a [[first-person shooter]], with the action being viewed on a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective inside of the plane's [[cockpit]], however he created all the views to be animated at a third-person angle and as a result, Landrum scaled down all of the assets in order to fit within the memory constrains and make it a third-person shooter instead.<ref name="RG152"/>

Once design of the project was finalized, programmer Chuck Sommerville came up with the title after writing it on a paper, which was likely inspired by the film and TV series ''Blue Thunder'', and gave it to designer RJ Mical, who liked the name.<ref name="RG152"/> Koch recounted positively about the development process of the title and working with the hardware, stating he and Landrum had a lot of freedom to develop the game they wanted with the available technology, however he also stated that the Lynx's limited screen resolution proved to be a source of difficulty for the team.<ref name="RG152"/>

''Blue Lightning'' makes heavy use of several features found within the Lynx hardware such as [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] scaling and rotation, with Sommerville developing an animation engine for the introductory sequence of the game, which would later be re-used on other titles for the system such as ''[[Electrocop]]'' and ''[[Todd's Adventures in Slime World]]''.<ref name="RG152"/> Sommerville stated the game violated a rule of the system imposed by Mical and co-designer [[Dave Needle]], which involved not accessing the [[ROM image]] once a game was running, as it streamed data for assets directly from the ROM and this technique would also be re-used in ''[[Zarlor Mercenary]]''.<ref name="RG152"/>

''Blue Lightning'' was one of the original launch titles during the initial release of the Lynx in 1989, along with ''[[California Games]]'', the aforementioned ''Electrocop'' and ''[[Gates of Zendocon]]''. It was also released in Europe around the same time period and later in Japan on December 1 of the same year, where it was distributed by Mumin Corporation instead and the difference between the international and Japanese releases is that the latter came bundled with an [[Video game packaging#Instruction manuals|instruction manual]] in Japanese.<ref name="GDRLynx"/><ref name="LLcfj"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Covell|first=Chris|url=https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/OTH_1989Q3.html|title=Japanese Secrets! - Other Systems: Jul. - Sept. 1989 - Atari Lynx Announcement|website=chrismcovell.com|date=March 3, 2016|accessdate=2019-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122091735/http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/OTH_1989Q3.html|archive-date=January 22, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The game was first showcased to the public during the [[Consumer Electronics Show#1980s|International Summer Consumer Electronics Show 1989]], along with the system.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-23/ACE_Issue_23_1989_Aug#page/n25/mode/2up|title=Hot From The USA - ACES From The Biggest Computer Show On Earth|magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]|issue=23|publisher=[[Ascential|EMAP]]|date=August 1989|pages=26–27|access-date=2019-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007232125/http://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-23/ACE_Issue_23_1989_Aug#page/n25/mode/2up|archive-date=2016-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref> Early previews showcased a different [[GUI]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Rignall|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Rignall|url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-093b/page/n7|title=Review - Atari's Unbelievable Advantage|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=93|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=August 1989|pages=8–9}}</ref>
