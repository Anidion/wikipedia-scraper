'''''Populous''''' is a video game developed by [[Bullfrog Productions]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]], released originally for the [[Amiga]] in 1989, and is regarded by many as the first [[god game]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/50-greatest-game-design-innovations?page=0,3 |title=50 greatest game design innovations |author=Edge Staff |date=November 1, 2007|website=Edge |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921174429/http://www.edge-online.com/features/50-greatest-game-design-innovations?page=0,3 |archive-date=21 September 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://games.ign.com/halloffame/populous.html |title=IGN Hall of Fame: Populous |website=IGN|year=2008 |access-date=2013-11-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104120533/http://games.ign.com/halloffame/populous.html |archive-date=4 November 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designersnotebook.com/Lectures/God_Games/god_games.htm |publisher=Designer's Notebook |author=Ernest Adams |title=What's Next for God Games |year=2008 |access-date=2013-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=75 Power Players |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=11  |date=November 1995 |page=51|issn=1078-9693|url=https://archive.org/details/nextgen-issue-011/page/n51/mode/2up|quote=Its first title, ''Populous'', created a whole new genre, the 'God' game.}}</ref> With over four million copies sold, ''Populous'' is one of the [[List of best-selling PC games|best-selling PC games of all time]].

The player assumes the role of a deity, who must lead followers through direction, manipulation, and divine intervention, with the goal of eliminating the followers led by the opposite deity. Played from an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]], the game consists of more than 500 levels, with each level being a piece of land which contains the player's followers and the enemy's followers. The player is tasked with defeating the enemy followers and increasing their own followers' population using a series of divine powers before moving on to the next level. The game was designed by [[Peter Molyneux]], and Bullfrog developed a gameplay prototype via a board game they invented using [[Lego]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Candy |first=Robin |title=Bullfrog: Ribbeting Stuff |url=https://archive.org/details/thegamesmachine-22/page/n73 |magazine=[[The Games Machine]] |issue=22  |date=September 1989 |pages=75–76|issn=0954-8092}}</ref>

The game received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the game's graphics, design, sounds and replay value. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades, including Game of the Year from several gaming publications. Retrospectively, it has been considered one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The game was ported to many other computer systems and was later supported with multiple expansion packs. It is the first game in the [[Populous (series)|''Populous'' series]], preceding ''[[Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods]]'' and ''[[Populous: The Beginning]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Amiga Populous.png|frame|left|Amiga screenshot]]

The main action window in ''Populous'' is viewed from an [[isometric projection|isometric]] perspective, and it is set in a "tabletop" on which are set the command [[computer icon|icons]], the world map (depicted as an open book) and a [[slider (computing)|slider bar]] that measures the level of the player's divine power or "[[magic point|mana]]".

The game consists of 500 [[Level (computer and video games)|levels]], and each level represents an area of land on which live the player's followers and the enemy followers. In order to progress to the next level the player must increase the number of their followers such that they can wipe out the enemy followers. This is done by using a series of divine powers. There are a number of different landscapes the world (depicted on the page in the book) can be, such as desert, rock and lava, snow and ice, etc. and the type of landscape is not merely aesthetic: it affects the development of the player's and enemy's followers.

The most basic power is raising and lowering land. This is primarily done in order to provide flat land for the player's followers to build on (though it is also possible to remove land from around the enemy's followers). As the player's followers build more houses they create more followers, and this increases the player's mana level.

Increasing the mana level unlocks additional divine powers that allow the player to interact further with the landscape and the population. The powers include the ability to cause [[earthquake]]s and [[flood]]s, create [[swamp]]s and [[volcano]]es, and turn ordinary followers into more powerful [[knight]]s.<ref name="PopulousManual">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/populousmanual|title=Populous Amiga version user manual |author=Bullfrog |year=1989 |format=PDF |work=Populous |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]}}</ref>

==Plot==
In this game the player adopts the role of a [[deity]] and assumes the responsibility of shepherding people by direction, manipulation, and [[miracle|divine intervention]]. The player has the ability to shape the landscape and grow their civilization – and their divine power – with the overall aim of having their followers conquer an enemy force, which is led by an opposing deity.<ref name="PopulousManual"/>

==Development==
[[File:Populous_Lego_Model.png|left|thumb|Lego model of Populous]]
[[Peter Molyneux]] led development, inspired by Bullfrog's artist [[Glenn Corpes]] having drawn isometric blocks after playing [[David Braben]]'s [[Zarch|Virus]].<ref name="PeterMolyneuxInterview"/><ref name="EdgeOnline">{{cite web | url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-populous/ |title=The Making Of: Populous|year=2012 |website=Edge|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710085757/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-populous |archive-date=10 July 2012 |url-status=unfit|author=Edge Staff|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The game's budget was £20,000.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Foster|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/99178270/the-observer/|title=Britain faces game drain|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|page=38|date=March 5, 1995|accessdate=April 6, 2022|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

Initially Molyneux developed an isometric landscape, then populated it with little people that he called "peeps", but there was no game; all that happened was that the peeps wandered around the landscape until they reached a barrier such as water. He developed the raise/lower terrain gameplay mechanic simply as a way of helping the peeps to move around. Then, as a way of reducing the number of peeps on the screen, he decided that if a peep encountered a piece of blank, flat land, it would build a house, and that a larger area of land would enable a peep to build a larger house. Thus the core mechanics – god-like intervention and the desire for peeps to expand – were created.<ref name="PeterMolyneuxInterview"/><ref name="EdgeOnline"/>

The endgame – of creating a final battle to force the two sides to enter a final conflict – developed as a result of the developmental games going on for hours and having no firm end.<ref name="PeterMolyneuxInterview"/><ref name="EdgeOnline"/>

Bullfrog attempted to prototype the gameplay via a board game they invented using [[Lego]], and Molyneux admits that whilst it didn't help the developers to balance the game at all, it provided a useful media angle to help publicise the game.<ref name="PeterMolyneuxInterview"/><ref name=CGW62/> One curious incident related in media coverage involved an attempt by Molyneux to investigate the displacement of water when adding blocks to the world model, this being frustrated by Lego not being watertight and thus causing a "flood" that "dissuaded further experimentation".<ref name="ace198903_populous">{{ cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/details/ACEIssue18Mar89/ACE_Issue_18_Mar_89/page/n17/mode/2up | title=And Frog Created Man | magazine=Advanced Computer Entertainment | date=March 1989 | access-date=8 August 2022 | issue=18 | last1=Wade | first1=Bob | pages=18–19 }}</ref>

During the test phase the testers requested a [[Cheating in video games|cheat code]] to skip to the end of the game, as there was insufficient time to play through all 500 levels, and it was only at this point that Bullfrog realised that they had not included any kind of ending to the game. The team quickly repurposed an interstitial page from between levels and used it as the final screen.<ref name="PeterMolyneuxInterview"/>

After demoing the game to over a dozen publishers, Bullfrog eventually gained the interest of [[Electronic Arts]], who had a gap in their spring release schedule and was willing to take a chance on the game. Bullfrog accepted their offer, although Molyneux later described the contract as "pretty atrocious:" 10% royalties on units sold, rising to 12% after one million units sold, with only a small up-front payment.<ref name="PeterMolyneuxInterview"/>

Peter Molyneux presented a post-mortem of the game's development and work in progress on a related personal project at Game Developers Conference in 2011.<ref name="GDC11"/>

==Expansion packs==
Bullfrog produced '''''Populous World Editor''''', which gave users the ability to modify the appearance of characters, cities, and terrain.<ref name=CGW96>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_96/page/n39/mode/2up |title=The World According To...Max: Electronic Arts' Populous World Editor |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |date=July 1992|last=Eden|first=Maxwell |pages=40–41|issn=0744-6667|issue=96}}</ref> An [[expansion pack]] called '''''Populous: The Promised Lands''''' added five new types of landscape (the geometric Silly Land, Wild West, Lego style Block Land, Revolution Française, and computer themed Bit Plains). In addition, another expansion disk called '''''Populous: The Final Frontier''''' added a single new landscape-type and was released as a [[cover disk]] for ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]''.<ref name=theonefrontier>{{cite magazine|title =The One: Final Frontier Disk|date =November 1989 |url =https://archive.org/details/TheOneIssue14Nov89/page/n7/mode/2up |magazine =The One |publisher =emap Images|issue =14 |page =8 }}</ref>

''Populous'' was released in 1989 to almost universal critical acclaim. The game received a 5 out of 5 stars in 1989 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #150 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column.<ref name="Dragon150"/> Biff Kritzen of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave the game a positive review, noting, "as heavy-handed as the premise sounds, it really is a rather light-hearted game." The simple design and layout were praised, as were the game's colourful graphics.<ref name=CGW62/> In a 1993 survey of pre 20th-century strategy games the magazine gave the game three stars out of five, calling it a "quasi-arcade game, but with sustained play value".<ref name=CGW107>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_107/page/n139/mode/2up |title=An Annotated Listing of Pre-20th Century Wargames |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |date=June 1993 |author=M.

''Populous'' is both highly original and amazingly addictive, with a constant challenge on offer". They gave the Mega Drive version of ''Populous'' an overall score of 91%.<ref name=mega />

In the September–October 1989 edition of ''[[Games International]]'' (Issue #9), John Harrington differed from other reviewers, only giving the game a rating of 2 out of 5, calling it "repetitive" and saying, "Although you take on the role of a god, somehow there is a lack of mystique about this game, and despite the cute graphics, the colourful worlds and the commendably elegant icon-driven game system, this game left me with a less than 'god like' feeling."<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine|last=Harrington|first=John| date=September–October 1989 |title=Computer Games|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=9|pages=48}}</ref>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reviewed the Amiga version, giving it an overall score of 96%.<ref name=cavg /> Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave the SNES version 31 out of 40.<ref name=famitsu /> ''[[Raze (magazine)|Raze]]'' gave the Mega Drive version of ''Populous'' an overall score of 89%.<ref name=raze /> ''[[Zero (video game magazine)|Zero]]'' gave the Amiga version of ''Populous'' an overall score of 92%.<ref name=zero /> ''Your Amiga'' gave the Amiga version of ''Populous'' an overall score of 93%.<ref name=your /> ''[[ST/Amiga Format]]'' gave the Amiga version of ''Populous'' an overall score of 92%.<ref name=st />

Maxwell Eden reviewed ''Populous World Editor'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Now all ''Populous'' fans wanting to be apprentice wizards can share in the magic of that gift. ''Populous'' is a great game and ''PWE'' is an ideal enhancement that breathes new life into weary bytes. Absolute power was never as incorruptible, nor this creative."<ref name="CGW96"/>

''[[Compute!]]'' named the game to its list of "nine great games for 1989", stating that with "great graphics, a simple-to-learn interface, and almost unlimited variety, ''Populous'' is a must buy for 1989".<ref name=compute110>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-07-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_110_1989_Jul#page/n25/mode/2up |title=Nine for '89 |magazine=[[Compute!]] |date=July 1989 |last=Gutman|first=Dan |page=25|issn=0194-357X}}</ref> Peter Molyneux estimated that the game accounted for nearly a third of all the revenue of [[Electronic Arts]] in that year.<ref name="PeterMolyneuxInterview">{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Molyneux |title=Game Developer's Conference - Classic Game Post-Mortem: Populous |year=2011 |website=GDC Vault|publisher=UBM Tech|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014633/Classic-Game-Postmortem |access-date=2013-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122003611/http://gdcvault.com/play/1014633/Classic-Game-Postmortem |archive-date=22 January 2013}}</ref>

[[Orson Scott Card]] in ''[[Compute!]]'' criticized the game's user interface, but praised the graphics and the ability to "create your own worlds ... you control the world of the game, instead of the other way around".<ref name=compute114>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-11-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_114_1989_Nov#page/n89/mode/2up |title=Deluged by Brilliant World-Creation Games: Entertainment Gameplay|magazine=[[Compute!]] |date=November 1989 |author=Orson Scott Card|page=88|issn=0194-357X|issue=114}}</ref> ''[[STart (magazine)|STart]]'' in 1990 gave "kudos especially to Peter Molyneux, the creative force behind ''Populous''".

Most video games posit you as a mere sword-wielding, perilously mortal human; in ''Populous'' you're a deity. Slow-paced, intricate, and difficult to learn: You literally have to create entire worlds while all the time battling those pesky forces of evil."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Strauss |first1=Bob |title=Video Games Guide |url=https://ew.com/article/1991/11/22/video-games-guide/ |magazine=Entertainment Weekly  |date=November 22, 1991}}</ref>

The game was released in the same month that [[The Satanic Verses controversy|''The Satanic Verses'' controversy]] gained publicity in the United States following the publication of ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' in the United States. Shortly after release, Bullfrog was contacted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and was warned that the "good vs evil" nature of the game could lead to them receiving similar [[fatwā]], although this did not materialize.<ref name="PeterMolyneuxInterview"/>

==Legacy==
In 1990 Bullfrog used the ''Populous'' engine to develop ''[[Powermonger]]'', a strategic combat-oriented game with similar mechanics to ''Populous'', but with a [[3D computer graphics|3-dimensional]] graphical interface. In 1991 they developed and released a true sequel, ''[[Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods]]'', and in 1998 a further direct sequel, ''[[Populous: The Beginning]]''.

''Populous'' was also released on the SNES, developed by Imagineer as one of the original titles for the console in Japan,<ref name="EdgeOnline"/> and features the addition of a race based on the [[Three Little Pigs]].

''[[Populous DS]]'', a new version of the game (published by [[Xseed Games]] in America and [[Rising Star Games]] in Europe), was developed by [[Genki (company)|Genki]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] and released 11 November 2008. The game allows the user to shape the in-game landscape using the DS's [[stylus]]. It also features a multiplayer mode allowing four players to play over a wireless connection.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hatfield |first1=Daemon |title=E3 2008: Census Taken of Populous DS |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/891/891574p1.html |website=IGN  |date=July 17, 2008 |url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722082902/http://ds.ign.com/articles/891/891574p1.html|archive-date=July 22, 2008}}</ref>

''Populous'' has been re-released through [[GOG.com]] and on [[Origin (service)|Origin]] through the [[Humble Bundle|Humble Origin Bundle]] sale. It runs under [[DOSBox]].

The browser-based game ''Reprisal'' was created in 2012 by Electrolyte and Last17 as a homage to ''Populous''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Maxwell|first=Ben|title=Populous reborn in your browser|url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/populous-reborn-your-browser/|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|date=May 21, 2012|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523024157/http://www.edge-online.com/news/populous-reborn-your-browser/|archive-date=May 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/05/this-free-game-takes-populous-and-gives-it-a-sworcery-makeover/ |title=This Free Game Takes Populous And Gives It A Sworcery Makeover |website=Kotaku|last=Hamilton|first=Kirk |date=22 May 2012 |access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref>
