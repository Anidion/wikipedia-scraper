==Gameplay==
''Joan of Arc: Siege & the Sword'' is a game in which the player is [[Charles VII of France|Charles]] of France in 1428 and must use [[Joan of Arc]]'s "miracle" army against defiant French dukes and the invading English.<ref name="CGW68"/>

==Reception==
Chris Lombardi reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "It has a wonderful setting, a nice 'look and feel', and elements that truly capture the spirit of the historical period, but the prevalence and nature of the action sequences, along with the quirks in Al and design, keep it from being "all that it could be" and prevent one from offering a wholehearted recommendation."<ref name="CGW68">{{cite magazine |last=Lombardi |first=Chris |title=The Witch of Orleans: Broderbund's Joan of Arc: Siege and The Sword |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=February 1990 |volume=1 |issue=68 |pages=14, 16}}</ref>
