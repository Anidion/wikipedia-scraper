'''''Stormlord''''' is a [[platform game]] developed and published by [[Hewson Consultants]] in 1989.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Stormlord International Releases |url=https://www.giantbomb.com/stormlord/3030-1044/releases/ |access-date=2023-09-19 |website=Giant Bomb |language=en}}</ref> It was released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[MS-DOS]].<ref name=":0" /> It was ported to the [[Sega Genesis]] by Punk Development for Razorsoft and published in 1990.<ref name="Genesis Firsts The Rating System" />

It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Deliverance: Stormlord II]]''.

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}

The player can eliminate enemies by throwing a star-like weapon and travel rapidly from place to place by means of a particularly-powerful [[trampoline]]. In certain versions, this was replaced by a falcon.  However, sometimes the journeys must be carefully planned out, since the falcon can transport the player on one-way trips, and if all fairies have not been freed from the previous area, it will be impossible to win. The player has a limited amount of time to finish (before the sunset).

== Ports ==
[[Sega of America]] pulled the Genesis edition of the game off the market and forced Razorsoft to give clothing to cover up the faries' bare breasts.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The History of Stormlord – Gaming Alexandria |url=https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/2019/01/the-history-of-stormlord/ |access-date=2023-09-19 |website=www.gamingalexandria.com}}</ref> Indeed, certain advertisements for the game often made note of the controversy. In August 1991 Sega also announced that it was bringing legal action against RazorSoft for unauthorized use of Sega's "trademarks, copyrights and logos," and a breach of contract.<ref>''[[GamePro]]'' 28 (November 1991)</ref> Yet, programmer Kevin Seghetti stated that the changes on the Genesis version were done voluntarily.<ref name="Genesis Firsts The Rating System">{{cite web|url=http://www.sega-16.com/feature_page.php?id=57&title=Genesis%20Firsts:%20The%20Rating%20System|title=Genesis Firsts The Rating System|publisher=Sega-16.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404105434/http://www.sega-16.com/feature_page.php?id=57&title=Genesis%20Firsts:%20The%20Rating%20System|archive-date=2009-04-04|url-status=dead|access-date=2008-11-16}}</ref>

However, when ''[[Amstrad Action]]'' gave the complete CPC version of the game away on their free covertape they edited the code of the game to cover up the fairies with a black square. This was due to avoid controversy with their young readership, or their parents.<ref>''Amstrad Action'' #99, December 1993</ref>

In 2009, ''[[GamesRadar]]'' included it among the games "with untapped franchise potential", commenting: "Nowadays, thanks to games like ''[[Conan (2004 video game)|Conan]]'' and ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'', bare-chested men are free to rescue bare-chested women and ''Stormlord'' is ripe for a comeback."<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/123-games-with-untapped-franchise-potential/?page=4 123 games with untapped franchise potential], GamesRadar US, April 30, 2009</ref>
