==Reception==
''QuestBusters'' reviewed the Amiga version of ''Bride of the Robot'' in a February 1990 issue, criticizing the game's graphics as "not great", but praising the game's 'juvenile' humor. ''QuestBusters'' criticized ''Bride of the Robot's'' puzzles as "dumb", as well as the abundance of ways to die, stating that "To create a series of stupid puzzles, kill the player and razz him when he dies shows the mentality and morality of a thirteen year-old juvenile delinquent." ''QuestBusters'' noted the game as overpriced, expressing that real pornography's cheaper and has more sexual content, and overall summarized ''Bride of the Robot'' as "disappointing".<ref name=questbusters>{{cite magazine|title = Bride of the Robot|date = February 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/questbusters-v7n02/page/n9/mode/2up|magazine = QuestBusters|last = St. Andre|first = Ken|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 10, 15}}</ref>

German gaming magazine ''Amiga Joker'' gave the Amiga version of ''Bride of the Robot'' an overall score of 34%, criticizing the game's plot as 'stupid' and the overall quality of the game as 'outdated', calling it "a cheap game running on [[Commodore 64]] code from 1985." ''Amiga Joker'' criticized ''Bride of the Robot's'' graphics, sound effects, and parser, expressing that "The graphics are low-quality and anything but exciting, the sound is limited to a beep-y [[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|wedding march]] and a few miserable sound effects ... all in all the parser barely understands anything". ''Amiga Joker'' summarised ''Bride of the Robot'' as having "essentially nothing to look forward to", further expressing that "If you were to use the money [spent on the game] to buy a porno magazine, it would be better spent."<ref name=joker>{{cite magazine|title = Bride of the Robot Amiga Review|date = February 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Joker_1990-02_Joker_Verlag_DE/page/n67/mode/2up|magazine = Amiga Joker|publisher = Joker Verlag|last = Schikora|first = Ralf|language = German|page = 68}}</ref>
