'''''MiG-29: Soviet Fighter''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] game developed by [[Codemasters]] in 1989 and released for several contemporary [[home computer]]s. An unlicensed version was also released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Camerica]].

==Gameplay==
The player plays the role of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] fighter pilot. The object of the game is to defeat the World Terrorist Army. It is similar in style to ''[[After Burner]]''. ''MiG-29'' [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]]s have a small switch in the back to make the game compatible with U.S. and European systems.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://games.ign.com/objects/025/025360.html |title=IGN: Camerica<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2005-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206173508/http://games.ign.com/objects/025/025360.html |archive-date=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Development==
The original version of the game was written for the ZX Spectrum by Richard Chaney while he was a pupil at [[Wolfreton School]], Hull, UK. Updated graphics and sound were later added by Codemasters. The ten names on the high score table are pupils in Richard's form at the school, giving away the game's home-grown origins.
