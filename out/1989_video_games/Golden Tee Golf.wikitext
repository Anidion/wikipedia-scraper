'''''Golden Tee Golf''''' is a [[golf]] [[arcade game]] series by [[Incredible Technologies]]. Its signature feature is the use of a [[trackball]]<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Peter Jacobson's Golden Tee 3D Golf |url=https://archive.org/details/NEXT_Generation_14/page/n177/mode/2up |access-date=4 March 2022 |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |volume=2 |issue=14 |publisher=Imagine Media |date=February 1996|page=176 |url-access=registration |quote=Using the new, improved handy-dandy, hip... trackball (surely proving to be a revival in the '90s), you swing through three pleasant, 18-hole courses (Oak Valley, Ocean Point, and Cactus Canyon).}}</ref> to determine the power, direction and curve of the player's golf shot. Play modes include casual 18-hole golf, closest to the pin, and online tournaments. One of the longest running arcade game series, ''Golden Tee'' has maintained a large following and spawned a competitive tournament scene.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/20/technology/can-t-get-a-tee-time-try-the-corner-bar.html|title=Can't Get a Tee Time?

== History ==
[[File:Golden Tee 3D screenshot.png|thumb|left|The success of ''Golden Tee 3D'' started a succession of yearly releases for the franchise, here the game illustrates its trackball-based controls.]]

The ''Golden Tee'' series began as a project at Incredible Technologies to create a large scale [[golf simulator]] for sizable family entertainment centers. The idea was scrapped, but not before programmer Larry Hodgson had already written software to create virtual golf courses. Rather than discard his work, Hodgson retooled the concept to develop a golf game for regular [[arcade cabinet]]s. He worked with co-designer Jim Zielinski, who initially rendered the courses using [[Deluxe Paint]]. Instead of a regular [[joystick]] and buttons for controls, they used a trackball, which Incredible Technologies had previously used for ''[[Capcom Bowling]]''.<ref name="FTW"/>

The first ''Golden Tee'' was play-tested in a bar, a venue which would become the most popular location for ''Golden Tee'' cabinets. Released in 1989, the first iteration was sold exclusively as a kit that could be used to convert existing arcade machines to ''Golden Tee.'' It sold relatively well, but the series would find greater success with ''Golden Tee 3D'' several years later.<ref name="FTW">{{Cite web|title=How Golden Tee became the best bar game in America|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/06/golden-tee-the-history-of-a-beer-soaked-american-pastime|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett|date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2017|author=Siegel, Alan}}</ref> The 1995 ''[[Peter Jacobson's Golden Tee 3D Golf]]'' (featuring [[Peter Jacobsen]]) was the first in the series to support online networked play. Rather than being networked to each other, the cabinets were all linked to a central computer which compared scores for tournament play. The first test tournament, held on 24 game cabinets in the [[Chicago]] area from November 24 to December 17, 1995, awarded real money to the winners, including a $1,000 grand prize.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Webb |first1=Marcus |title=Another Network Test |url=https://archive.org/details/nextgen-issue-015/mode/2up |access-date=4 March 2022 |work=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |volume=2 |issue=15 |publisher=Imagine Media |date=March 1996 |page=23 |url-access=registration}}</ref> The first "real world" tournament was held mid-June to July 7, 1996, on 145 cabinets across six states, and was considered a major success.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Webb|first=Marcus |title=Modem-Linked Video Scores |url=https://archive.org/details/nextgen-issue-022/page/n23/mode/2up |access-date=4 March 2022 |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|volume=2 |issue=22 |publisher=Imagine Media |date=October 1996|page=22 |url-access=registration}}</ref> By the end of 1996, 1,250 cabinets were installed across 32 states.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Marcus|last=Webb|title=And in the U.S.A... |url=https://archive.org/details/NEXT_Generation_27/page/n27/mode/2up |access-date=4 March 2022 |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |volume=3 |issue=27|publisher=Imagine Media |date=March 1997|page=26 |url-access=registration}}</ref> The tournament gave rise to a large competitive play scene for the franchise.<ref name="WSJ">{{cite news|title=It's Rough to Make a Living as a Pro Golfer on the Bar Circuit|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304765304577478583110102656 |author=Belkin, Douglas|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 5, 2012|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref><ref name="RS">{{cite magazine|title=Bangers and Everymen: Life on the 'Golden Tee' Pro Tour|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/bangers-and-everymen-life-on-the-golden-tee-pro-tour-20140903|author=Allen, Jeff|date=September 3, 2014|accessdate=July 11, 2017|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-04-30-video-golf_x.htm|title=Video golf champ has a steady hand, 'Golden Tee'|website=[[USA Today]] |date=April 30, 2003|accessdate=July 11, 2017|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Ryan Bourgeois has won the US national championship three times.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-10-24-0310240022-story.html|date=October 13, 2013 |title=One-trackball mind |first=Whet |last=Moser |newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>
