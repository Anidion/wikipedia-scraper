'''''Badlands''''' is a 1989 [[arcade video game]] published by [[Atari Games]]. It was ported by [[Domark]] under the [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] label to the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. The game is a re-themed version of Atari's previous racing games ''[[Super Sprint]]'' and ''Championship Sprint'' with the addition of vehicular combat. ''Badlands'' is set in the aftermath of a nuclear war and races around abandoned wastelands with many hazards. Three gun-equipped cars race around a track to win prizes.

==Gameplay==

''Badlands'' pits three cars against each other in a three lap race around a small, single-screen circuit. Bonuses are present in the form of wrenches which can be traded for goods such as extra speed, extra acceleration or better [[tires]].

Unlike the ''Sprint'' games, ''Badlands'' expands upon the formula, taking place in a post-apocalyptic environment and equipping each of the players with [[cannon]]s. In reality, the cannons do little except to slow cars down by repeatedly shooting at them, but the shop between levels offers the possibility of arming the car with [[missile]]s which will destroy the target car, placing it at a severe disadvantage as a replacement is brought onto the track, taking a few seconds.

The tracks also featured a number of new obstacles, including mines and retractable barricades.

==Reception==
Response to the Spectrum version was mixed. ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' and ''[[Crash (magazine)|CRASH]]'' awarded average marks, both claiming in reviews of the original and rerelease that the title's contemporary ''[[Ivan 'Ironman' Stewart's Super Off Road|Super Off-Road]]'' was superior.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''[[Sinclair User]]'' expressed more enthusiasm for the game, but made the same comparison to ''Super Off-Road''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
