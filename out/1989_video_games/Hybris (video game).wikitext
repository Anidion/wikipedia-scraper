''Hybris'' has a weapon enhancement feature, called "expansion"; once a new weapon has been collected it can be temporarily upgraded by the player rotating the joystick or pressing "Enter" on the keyboard, each weapon can be enhanced three times before a new weapon is needed in order to enhance again.
