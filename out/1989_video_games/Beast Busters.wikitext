[[File:Beast_Busters_Arcade_Gameplay_Screenshot.png|thumb|left|''Beast Busters'' is a [[rail shooter]] where the player shoots [[zombies]].]]
In the game, players control one of three mercenaries named Johnny Justice, Paul Patriot and Sammy Stately, who must discover the cause of a bizarre outbreak and shoot their way out of a city that has been invaded by the [[undead]] called Beasts. The original arcade machine allows for up to three players to play the game at the same time. [[Light gun|Guns are mounted]] to the machine and look like machine guns. Players can earn a number of [[power-up]]s through the course of each stage to aid them in battle such as [[rocket]]s, [[grenade]]s, armor, health packs, and ammo.<ref name=crash>{{cite magazine|title =Arcade Action: Beast Busters |date =May 1990 |url =https://archive.org/details/Crash_No._76_1990-05_Newsfield_GB/page/n7/mode/2up |magazine =Crash |publisher =Newsfield Publishing |last =Caswell |first =Mark |issue =76 |page =8}}</ref>

The game has seven sections for players to shoot their way through. In between stages players are shown [[cutscene]]s explaining the events of the [[zombie]] infestation that has overtaken the city. Each stage has a sub boss as well as an [[boss (video gaming)|end boss]] to defeat, all of which have 2 forms to defeat. The game was known for having unusual [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]], such as a zombie punk who mutates into a [[dog]], or a [[Willys MB|jeep]] which starts coming to life. One stage ends with the militiamen having to rescue a female [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent from that stage's boss.
