'''''Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball''''' (released in Japan as '''''Softball Tengoku''''') is a one- or two-player [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] video game where players can select various fictional [[softball]] players and customize their own team to take to the championship.<ref name="nesplayer">{{cite web| url = http://www.nesplayer.com/features/famicom/7.htm| archive-url = https://archive.today/20060327145201/http://www.nesplayer.com/features/famicom/7.htm| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2006-03-27| title = Basic information| publisher = NES Player| accessdate = 2008-08-12}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
In 1-player mode, the player attempts to win one game on each available field. Upon doing so, the player then faces a difficult all-female team called "The Amazons" on the professional field. Defeating the Amazons beats the game. In 2-player mode, players play an "exhibition game."

Players choose either fast-pitch or slow-pitch mode, the playing field, a team of ten players from the 60 available characters, and a team name from a list of 26 names, one for each letter of the alphabet.

Despite the game being a softball game, the rules are more reminiscent of baseball, with the exception that each game is played to a maximum of seven innings (unless extra innings are needed to break a tie). The game also features a mercy rule, with the game ending if someone leads by 10 or more runs after an entire inning is played.

==Characters==
Players assemble their teams from 60 characters, some of whom have noticeable trademarks. For instance:
* Diablo looks like an [[ogre]]. He bats with a club, and runs very slowly.
* Zelda looks like a witch, and bats with a broom.
* Froggy skips as he runs.
* Casey has the ability to float in the air while playing defense.<ref name="30dash30dotclub">{{cite web| url = https://30-30.club/wiki/dusty-diamonds-all-star-softball-softball-tengoku/| title = Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball / Softball Tengoku| publisher = 30-30.club| accessdate = 2023-12-03}}</ref>

==Fields==
The game features six different playing fields, each with its own features and ground rules.
* Sandlot: Based on a traditional [[sandlot ball|sandlot]], the field has areas with high grass and rocks that can interfere with a live play. To hit a home run, the player only has to hit a ball over the "home run line," not beyond the fence.
* Park: There is a pond in foul territory. The area beyond the home run line has trees, park benches, and a mud puddle that can interfere with the play.
* Cliff: Any hit that rolls under the picket fence in right field is a ground-rule double.
* School: Based on a schoolyard. A fly ball that lands beyond the home run line is a home run, but if it breaks a window on the school building then it's an automatic out instead.
* Island: Similar to a professional field, with an outfield fence.
* Professional: Standard field. Only available in 1-player mode after defeating the computer on the other five fields.
