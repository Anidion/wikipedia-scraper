{{Nihongo foot|'''''Dragon Spirit: The New Legend'''''|ドラゴンスピリット 新たなる伝説|Doragon Supiritto: Aratanaru Densetsu|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is a [[Shoot 'em up|shoot 'em-up]] [[video game]] developed by [[Now Production]] and published by [[Namco]] in Japan and [[Bandai]] worldwide for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1989. It is a remixed port of the 1987 arcade game ''[[Dragon Spirit]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:DragonSpirittheNewLegendNESScreenshot.PNG|left|thumb|The two headed dragon is fighting the final battle against the evil monster of the abyss.]]
''Dragon Spirit: The New Legend'' is a vertical shooter that plays similarly to ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'', ''[[1943: The Battle of Midway|1943]]'', and ''[[Tiger-Heli]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/NES/dragon_spirit_the_new_legend/ | title = Advanced overview | publisher = NeoSeeker | date = | accessdate = 2011-05-24}}</ref> The player controls a [[dragon]] who must use fireballs to destroy various enemies.

There are two different kinds of games: the golden dragon game (easy difficulty level) or the blue dragon game (normal difficulty level).<ref name=nesworld/> A story is told between levels as the player progresses.

The "easy mode" that will become available if the player dies during the opening level offers a very different gameplay experience from the standard mode. 

Major differences in gameplay aside from the color of the dragon include differentiation in powers. The gold dragon is much faster by default, both in movement and attack speed. Additionally, power-up transformations are far more destructive and effective, often wiping out most enemies in a single strike, and sweeping across the entire screen, in some cases leaving no enemy alive.

In addition to enhanced powers and speed, many of the more difficult levels are removed from this mode, shortening the total game and story. The golden dragon also takes more damage and will face slightly different enemies and bosses. The story for Prince Lace is very different from that of King Amru's tale should the player successfully activate the standard difficulty game.

The player has 360° control within the screen on display, with most enemies appearing at the top of the screen. Hitting enemies on-screen damages (and ultimately kills) the main character.<ref name=miked>{{cite web | url= http://www.mikedidonato.com/2011/03/18/nes-review-1-dragon-spirit-the-new-legend/ | title = Gameplay information | publisher = Mike Di Donato | date=March 18, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-05-24}}</ref> Players have two kinds of attacks; shoot directly in the air with fire or bomb the ground with bombs.<ref name=miked/> There are nine worlds in the game, ranging from the [[Paleozoic Era]] to a parallel universe known only as the ''Evil Palace'', where the final boss awaits the player in his lair.<ref name=miked/>

==Plot==
Peace has reigned over the kingdom of Olympis for years, thanks to King Amul's (Amru in the English translation) heroic battle against the demon Zawel.<ref name=nesworld>{{cite web | url = http://www.nesworld.com/spotlight-dragonspirit.php | title = Story/gameplay information | website = NES World | date = | accessdate = 2011-05-24}}</ref> After Amul married Aricia, they had two children, Princess Iris and Prince Lace.<ref name=nesworld/> The evil Galda was building an army of evil and used his black magic to resurrect Zawel from the dead.<ref name=nesworld/> Galda has decided to attack the [[Earth]]. Amru's son Prince Lace wakes suddenly from a nightmare, wherein his father Amru is killed when fighting Zawel, which is not how that event transpired (i.e., the player's failure to complete the first level). He is then confronted by the sorcerer Galda who declares that he is taking Lace's sister, Princess Iris, to be his prisoner. Lace takes up his father's sword to rescue his kidnapped sister from the demon Galda. Instead of transforming into a blue dragon-like his father, Lace becomes a gold dragon.
