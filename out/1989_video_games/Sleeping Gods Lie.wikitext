'''''Sleeping Gods Lie''''' was a first-person adventure game released on the [[Amiga]], [[DOS]] and [[Atari ST]], published by [[Empire Interactive]] in 1989. 

==Gameplay==
It was set in the world of Tessera, a land created by the Gods, which had fallen into the control of an evil Archmage who terrorised the populace with the aid of evil demons. The player took the role of an adventurer, with a quest through eight kingdoms. The goal was to find  N'Gnir, one of the sleeping Gods who created the world, and to wake him up so he could rid the world of the demons.

==Reception==
Tom Malcom for ''[[.info (magazine)|Info]]'' said "''Sleeping Gods Lie'' could have used some more polish, but it's one of the most unusual and playable adventures I've been on in a long time."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/info-magazine-47/Info_Issue_47_1992_Feb/page/n29/mode/2up|title=Info Magazine Issue 47|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Tony Dillon for ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' said "with a little more planning and a bias away from arcade toward RPG, ''Sleeping Gods Lie'' could have been a real corker. As it is, it falls uneasily between two stools."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Ace_Magazine_Issue_22/page/40/mode/2up|title=Ace Magazine Issue 22|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Zzap!64|Zzap!]]'' said "if you've the time and patience for such a big challenge ''Sleeping Gods Lie'' could just be the off-beat kind of hit you want. Less committed adventurers however, are probably best advised to try before buying."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/zzapp_64_issue_054_600dpi/page/n79/mode/2up|title=Zzap! 64 Issue 054 (HQ)|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[ST Action]]'' said "As a first release, ''Sleeping Gods Lie'' is excellent. It's by no means easy but nevertheless it does keep you coming back for more."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/st-action-16-august-1989/page/62/mode/2up|title=ST Action 16 August 1989|date=August 1, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[The Games Machine]]'' said "Though most suited to RPGers (and adventurers), the arcade elements of combat and exploration open up the involving fantasy world of Tessara to action freaks also."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/TheGamesMachineIssue21Aug89/page/n97/mode/2up|title=The_Games_Machine_Issue_21_Aug_89|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' said "It's difficult to imagine who Sleeping Gods Lie could appeal to â€“ it's far too slow-moving for most of us, and any serious RPG fan will no doubt dismiss it as lightweight piffle. Personally, it bored me to tears."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/The_One_Issue_047/page/n85/mode/2up|title=The One Issue 047|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Gordon Houghton for ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said "A great attempt at a world simulator, combining RPG and arcade adventure; unfortunately, the scenario isn't compelling enough or the gameplay addictive enough to back it up."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_0093/page/n39/mode/2up|title=Computer and Video Games Issue 0093|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Steve Cooke for ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' said "If [...] you're of the broad-minded category of gamesplayer and enjoy exploration with a bit of action on the way, then SGL offers a pretty enormous challenge."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/The_One_Issue_011/page/n63/mode/2up|title=The One Issue 011|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Peter Olafson for ''[[Amiga World]]'' said "If you're tired of waiting for the sequel to Drakkhen, or of waiting for any good new RPG, you'll love Sleeping Gods Lie. I recommend it wholeheartedly."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/AmigaWorldIssue066199203IDGCI300dpi/page/n61/mode/2up|title=Amiga_World_Issue_066__1992_03__IDGC_I__300dpi_|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Michael Spiteri for ''The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review'' said "If you are looking for something different but still perplexing and challenging, then take a look at ''Sleeping Gods Lie''."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Australian_Commodore_and_Amiga_Review_The_Volume_6_Issue_10_1989-10_Saturday_Magazine_AU/page/n71/mode/2up|title=Australian Commodore and Amiga Review, The - Volume 6 Issue 10 (1989-10)(Saturday Magazine)(AU)|date=October 1, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
