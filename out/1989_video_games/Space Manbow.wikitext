{{nihongo foot|'''''Space Manbow'''''|スペースマンボウ|''Supēsu Manbō''||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] developed and published on December 21, 1989 by [[Konami]] for the [[MSX2]] and MSX2+ home computers. It was re-released for mobile phones on September 1, 2006; for the [[Nintendo Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service on November 24, 2009;<ref name=Nintendolife>[http://vc.nintendolife.com/games/msx/space_manbow Space Manbow Virtual console details]</ref> on February 19, 2014, for the [[Wii U]]; and on July 28, 2015, for the Windows Store (Project EGG). It has never been released outside [[Japan]].

== Gameplay ==
{{Expand section|date=September 2022}}
In the game, the player pilots a starship shaped like a [[Sharptail mola|mambo fish]].<ref name=HG101>{{cite web |url=http://hardcoregaming101.net/konamishooters/konamishooters5.htm |title=Konami Shoot Em Ups: MSX Shooters |author=Kurt Kalata |date= |work=Hardcore Gaming 101 |publisher= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref> There are only two weapon types available throughout the game, which can be powered up through standard pickups. The weapons gradually lose power unless the player makes additional pickups, but the ship is helped by two stationary "options" similar to those found in the ''[[Gradius]]'' series. The "options" are able to shift so that they alternatively fire in three directions: forward, backward, and towards the top/bottom of the screen.

== Development and release ==
{{Expand section|date=September 2022}}
Originally, Space Manbow was intended to be a port of the arcade game [[Thunder Cross (video game)|Thunder Cross]] under the working title of Egzart.

== Reception ==
{{Expand section|date=September 2022}}
The game was praised for its bright colors and smooth scrolling something the MSX2 particularly struggled with.

== Notes ==
The video game [[Ganbare Goemon]] on the [[Nintendo DS]] contains an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] that lets you play the entire Space Manbow first level if you insert the [[Game Boy Advance]] cartridge for the games ''[[Kessakusen! Ganbare Goemon 1 & 2]].''{{notelist}}
