'''''Wrestle War''''' is a video game developed and published by [[Sega]] which was released in arcades in 1989, and later ported to the [[Sega Mega Drive]] console in 1991 in Japan, Australia, and Europe. Despite being released the same year as [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s ''[[WrestleWar]]'' pay-per-view event, it is not associated with any wrestling promotion. The original Japanese game cover featured a [[Hulk Hogan]] look-alike, but it was changed for the international release.

''Wrestle War'' was included as part of the ''[[Sega Smash Pack]]'' compilation for the [[Dreamcast]] in 2001. In 2022, the original arcade version will be included as part of the Sega Astro City Mini V, a vertically-oriented variant of the Sega Astro City mini console.<ref>{{cite web|last=McFerran|first=Damien|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/12/segas-astro-city-mini-is-getting-a-tate-version-packed-with-shmup-goodness|title=Sega's Astro City Mini Is Getting A 'TATE' Version Packed With Shmup Goodness|work=[[Nintendo Life]]|publisher=Nlife Media|date=December 17, 2021|access-date=2021-12-17}}</ref>
