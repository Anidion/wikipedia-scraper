{{nihongo foot|'''''WWF Superstars'''''|WWFスーパースターズ|WWF Sūpāsutāzu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[List of wrestling video games|wrestling video game]] manufactured by [[Technōs Japan]] and released for [[arcade game|arcades]] in 1989. It is the first [[WWE|WWF]] arcade game to be released. A series of unrelated games with the [[WWF Superstars (Game Boy)|same title]] were released by [[LJN]] for the original [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]]. Technōs followed the game with the release of ''[[WWF WrestleFest]]'' in 1991.

==Features==
The game features some of the signature moves and trademark mannerisms of the wrestlers in the game. There are also [[cut scene]]s featuring [[Ted DiBiase]], [[André the Giant]] and [[Virgil (wrestler)|Virgil]]. [[Gene Okerlund|Mean Gene Okerlund]], and [[Miss Elizabeth]] make appearances as well. Before the first match, the player's chosen team enters the arena via the "ring cart" seen at [[WrestleMania]]s [[WrestleMania III|III]] and [[WrestleMania VI|VI]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Arcade 0198 13.png|thumb|left|Hulk Hogan and the Honky Tonk Man team up in a tag team match.]]
Players select two wrestlers to form a [[tag team]]. The playable wrestlers are [[Hulk Hogan]], "Macho Man" [[Randy Savage]], [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]], [[Ray Traylor|Big Boss Man]], "Hacksaw" [[Jim Duggan]], and [[The Honky Tonk Man]]. Up to two players can play at once. The players take their team through a series of matches with other tag teams in [[New York City]] and then [[Tokyo]].

The game features a basic grappling and attack system. From a grapple, a player can either toss the opponent, throw them into the ropes, or go into a headlock from which two character-specific grapple moves can be performed. Each wrestler also possesses standing strikes, running attacks, running counterattacks, ground attacks, and moves from the top turnbuckle. A referee is present in the ring, but cannot be attacked or otherwise affected by the wrestlers.

It is also possible to brawl outside of the ring, provided the player reenters before a count of 20. There, a table can be picked up and swung at opponents. If both wrestlers go outside the ring at once, their tag team partners automatically jump out to join the fight. Occasionally one of these partners will wander off screen and return wielding a folding chair. Neither the chair nor table can be taken inside the ring.

After three matches are won, players get to challenge the [[Mega Bucks]] ("The Million Dollar Man" [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[André the Giant]]) for the final round. Most grapple moves do not work against André because of his immense size. (Though two specific grapple moves can be used on him. Since they do not require him to be lifted. Honky Tonk Man's [[noogie]], and The Big Boss Man's [[headbutt]].) The Mega Bucks are not selectable characters. However, there are cheats for [[MAME]] that allow them to be used (together or separately), the drawback being that if DiBiase or André get a submission victory, the game will think that the player lost. Also, there can sometimes be graphical errors which will make the in-ring opponent disappear.

If the player wins the title match, a newspaper headline heralding the players' tag team as champions is shown. The player is then taken through another series of three matches (one of which will feature DiBiase) in the other city and a final match against DiBiase and André before the game ends.

== Reception ==
