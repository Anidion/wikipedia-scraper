It was originally released in Japan in December 1989 and North America in September 1990. It is the first game in the ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' series and the first [[role-playing video game]] for the system. Square translated the game into English for worldwide release and renamed it, linking it with the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series to improve marketing. [[Sunsoft]] re-released it in North America during 1998; Square followed with a Japan-exclusive [[Video game remake|remake]] released for the [[WonderSwan#WonderSwan Color|WonderSwan Color]] and mobile phones in 2002 and 2007 respectively, it was also ported to the [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2020 and later ported to [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2021.

''The Final Fantasy Legend'' operates on a [[Turn-based games|turn-based]] system similar to that of ''[[Final Fantasy II]]''. The game's characters battle monsters and fiends using a variety of weapons, armor, and skills that develop through the player's actions. The game follows the story of four heroes who attempt to scale a tower at the center of the world that supposedly leads to paradise. The four heroes may belong to one of three character classes, each housing a unique customization path.

''The Final Fantasy Legend'' was conceived by Nobuyuki Hoshino and developed under director [[Akitoshi Kawazu]]; renowned composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] wrote its score. The game is Square's first million seller with 1.37 million units shipped. Though released to mixed reception, it has since been described as one of the Game Boy's greatest games and cited as an influence for series such as the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:FFlegend1.png|frame|left|The protagonist in a town, standing in front of an inn and guild hall.]]
In ''The Final Fantasy Legend'', the player navigates a character throughout the game world with a party of up to four characters, exploring areas and interacting with [[non-player character]]s. Most of the game occurs in towns, castles, caves, and similar areas.<ref name="gbman24-25">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] pp. 24-25. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> To aid exploration on the field screen, the game makes use of various signs within towns.<ref name="gbman22-23">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] pp. 22-23. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> The player is initially limited to the World of Continent to explore,<ref name="gbman12">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 12. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> and given access to later worlds as his or her party climbs the Tower.

''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref>

Players can journey between field screen locations via the [[overworld|world map]], a downsized representation of ''Final Fantasy Legend''{{'}}s various worlds.

===Classes===
At the beginning of the game, the player must choose a [[character class]], gender, and name for the group's "party leader".<ref name="gbman7">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 7. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> There are three available classes: ''humans'', ''mutants'' (''espers'' in the Japanese version),<ref name="Ref_">{{cite web |title=魔界塔士 サ・ガ (Espers) |language=ja |url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/mobile/sem/saga/chara/esper.html |publisher=[[Square Enix]]. |access-date=2009-06-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308123522/http://www.square-enix.co.jp/mobile/sem/saga/chara/esper.html |archive-date=2012-03-08}}</ref> and ''monsters'', each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Character classes cannot be changed once the game has begun. The player may recruit up to three additional party members through a similar process via "Member Guilds" in various towns.<ref name="gbman13">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 13. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> Characters may also be recruited to replace fallen party members, though the party leader is irreplaceable. Higher-level party members may be recruited at later towns in the game.<ref name="gbman14">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 14. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref>

A character's performance in battle is determined by numerical values ("statistics") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are ''strength'', the effectiveness of physical attacks; ''defense'', the ability to reduce damage received; ''agility'', the effectiveness of ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and ''mana'', the effectiveness of magical attacks. A character's health is measured in ''[[hit points]]'' (''HP''), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999.<ref name="gbman28" /> Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense,<ref name="gbman8">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 8. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic.<ref name="gbman9">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 9. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types.<ref name = "gbman31"/> Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.<ref name="gbman10">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 10. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref>

Humans raise their statistics through items that grant permanent bonuses, such as "STRENGTH" or "HP200".<ref name="gbman8" /> Mutant attributes simply increase by random increments after battles, and new abilities may be gained (or lost) in the process.<ref name="gbman9" /> Monsters change in power by consuming "meat" dropped in battles; depending the monster's current sub-class and the meat's origin, the monster may transform into a stronger or weaker sub-class<ref name="gbman10" /> or fully recover health.<ref name="gbman54">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 54. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> Later versions of the game released upon the WonderSwan and mobile phones removed the latter effect entirely.

===Equipment and abilities===
The basic function of equipment in ''SaGa'' games is to increase character attributes. Arming a character with a gold helmet increases his or her base defense statistic, for example. The amount of equipment that can be placed on any one character at any time depends on the character's class. Humans can hold eight, mutants four, and monsters none. There are five types of armor: ''shields'', ''helmets'', ''breastplates'', ''gauntlets'', and ''shoes''. Only one of each at a time may be added to one character and cannot be added to monsters.<ref name="gbman31">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 31. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> Weapons, consisting of swords, hammers, whips, spell books, and guns, utilize either the strength, agility or mana attribute of a character, and can be used only a certain number of times before breaking and being removed from the player's inventory. Shields can be used as items in combat, most with a limited number of uses, and allow the user to evade enemy attacks.<ref name="gbman38">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 38. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref>

Mutants and monsters have different spells and abilities depending on their battle experience and sub-class. These come in one of four categories: ''attack'', ''non-combative'', ''healing'', and ''resistances/weaknesses''. When used in combat, attack spells and abilities will damage a target by an elemental type, while non-combative spells and abilities inflict various status ailments (such as "blindness") or grant benefits upon a target. Healing spells and abilities restore a target's HP and can be used outside of combat.<ref name="gbman39" /> Certain spells and abilities have added traits, like affecting a group of enemies or draining HP from a target.<ref name="gbman43-45">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] pp. 43-45. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> Each spell and ability has a finite number of uses, and once depleted the party must visit an inn to recharge them.<ref name="gbman39">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 39. ''Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> Resistances and weaknesses are abilities that are active throughout combat. Represented by an "O" or "X" next to the related element or status ailment, they respectively give the user either resistance or weakness to one or more types of attack; status ailments grant immunity against a particular ailment.<ref name="gbman42">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 42. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref>

Curative items can be found or purchased in the game through various means, each with a limited number of uses and able to be activated from a character's inventory or the items sub-menu to restore HP or remove a status ailment in or out of combat from a single target. Like other inventory items, in order to be used during combat these must be placed in a party member's equipment slot prior to battle.<ref name="gbman40-41">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] pp. 40-41. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref>

===Combat===
Combat is initiated when the player encounters an enemy, which changes the map to the "battle screen". The enemy appears at the top, above the current party characters; each battle uses a menu-driven [[Final Fantasy#Battle system|turn-based system]]. At the beginning of each turn, the player selects whether to fight or attempt to run.<ref name="gbman18">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 18. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> If the fight option is selected, the player selects an action for each party member from his or her equipment or skills to attack, defend, use magic, or use equipped items. Once the player has chosen actions for each player character, the player characters and enemy begin battle.<ref name="gbman19-20">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] pp. 19-20. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> Participants move one at a time determined by their agility statistic.<ref name="gbman28">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 28. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> If the player tries the "attempt to run" option and it fails, the party skip their turn and the enemy attacks.<ref name="gbman18" /> Combat ends if the party successfully flees, all enemies are defeated, or all player characters are defeated; in the last case, the game ends and must be reloaded from the last save.<ref name="gbman32" />

Winning battles may award the player money (''[[Final Fantasy gameplay#Currency|GP]]'') and items. Enemy monsters occasionally drop meat, which can be consumed by monster-class characters.<ref name="gbman20">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 20. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref> Mutant classes may "evolve" at this point, randomly gaining either increased statistics or a new random magic spell or ability, possibly overwriting an existing one.<ref name="gbman9" /> Party members that lose HP during combat can have them restored via curative items,<ref name="gbman41">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] p. 40.

Defeated characters with no remaining hearts cannot be revived. An item can be bought at significant expense to restore a heart to a character. Alternatively, a fallen party member can also be replaced completely with a new character recruited from a town guild, regardless of the number of hearts they have remaining.<ref name="gbman22-23" />

===Plot===
Standing in front of the tower, the hero and party learn that they cannot climb it to paradise without first unsealing its base door. In the base world, three kings named Armor, Sword, and Shield fight for dominance using a piece of legendary equipment corresponding to their names. Visiting King Armor, the party learns that he is in love with a girl who returns his feelings, but cannot marry him, as a bandit holds her village hostage in return for her love. They defeat the bandit, and the king gives them his armor in gratitude. King Sword attacks the heroes, who vanquish him and take the sword. Lastly, King Shield is murdered by his own steward, and after a short fight, the party recovers his shield. Restoring the items to a statue of a great hero, they receive the Black Sphere, but are attacked by [[Black Tortoise|Gen-bu]], the first of four fiends controlled by [[Asura|Ashura]]. They defeat him and use the power of the Sphere to enter the tower.<ref name="gbman47-74">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] pp. 47-74. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-04.</ref>

They climb the tower and come to another door; inside lies a second world surrounded by large bodies of water. By navigating caves, they find a floating island which allows them to travel around the world by air.<ref name="gbman75-78">[[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]] pp. 75-78. ''The Final Fantasy Legend, instruction manual'', Retrieved on 2009-06-05.</ref> They locate an old man, Ryu-O, and solve his riddle to obtain the Airseed, allowing them to breathe underwater and enter the undersea palace. They encounter the second fiend, [[Azure Dragon|Sei-ryu]]; they defeat him and recover half of the second sphere. Upon returning to Ryu-O, he reveals himself to be the guardian of the other half of the sphere, and the two halves form the Blue Sphere.

Using the Blue Sphere to continue up the tower, the party comes to a world of clouds, dominated by [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|Byak-ko]] and an army of thugs. They learn that Byak-ko recently wiped out an underground resistance movement, except for Millie and Jeanne, the two daughters of its leader. The party temporarily joins Byak-ko's gang to find the girls, and attempt to defend them until Millie betrays Jeanne and the party is captured. Breaking free, they confront the fiend, who tries to kill Millie; Jeanne takes the blow and the party engages the fiend. They defeat him, recover the White Sphere, and continue their journey.

The fourth world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland; [[Vermilion Bird|Su-Zaku]] roams the surface defended by an impenetrable forcefield. The party retreats to an abandoned subway for refuge and meets Sayaka, who directs them to the nearest town. There the party is confronted by the leader of a biker gang, So-Cho, but his sister Sayaka intervenes and the two groups agree to work together to defeat Su-Zaku. As they gather the needed parts for a device to deactivate the forcefield, So-Cho sacrifices his life to guide the party through an atomic power plant. Beasts then ambush the town, and Su-Zaku kidnaps Sayaka. The party defeats Su-Zaku, earns the Red Sphere and travels on.

Climbing the tower, the party discovers the remains of a family that attempted to reach Paradise but failed,<ref name="Ref_e">{{cite video game|title=The Final Fantasy Legend |developer=[[Square (video game company)|Square Co]] |publisher=[[Square (video game company)|Square Co]] |date=1990-09-30 |platform=[[Game Boy]] |level=before Ashura |quote='''Diary:''' We barely made it to this shelter.

==Development==
''The Final Fantasy Legend'' was the first installment of the ''SaGa'' series in Japan and the first Game Boy game produced by Square.<ref name="assl1" /> Square president [[Masafumi Miyamoto]] requested developers create a Game Boy game after he noticed the success of ''[[Tetris (Game Boy)|Tetris]]'' and the popularity of the handheld system.
