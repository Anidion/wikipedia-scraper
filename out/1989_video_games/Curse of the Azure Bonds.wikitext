'''''Curse of the Azure Bonds''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Strategic Simulations]], Inc (SSI) in 1989. It is the second in a four-part series of [[Forgotten Realms]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons|Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[Gold Box]] adventure [[Video game|computer games]], continuing the events after the first part, ''[[Pool of Radiance]]''.

The game serves as a sequel to the 1988 novel, ''[[Azure Bonds]]'', that was written by [[Kate Novak]] and [[Jeff Grubb]], and is the first book of the ''[[Finder's Stone]]'' trilogy. An [[List of Dungeons & Dragons modules|adventure module]] [[Curse of the Azure Bonds (module)|of the same name]], coded FRC2, was written based on the game.

==Gameplay==
A party of up to six [[player character]]s and two [[non-player character]]s is required to complete the various quests in the game.<ref name=manual/>  Player characters from ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'' (POR) can be transferred to ''Curse of the Azure Bonds'', although players do not need to have played POR to play this game.<ref name="CGW63"/> Characters can likewise be transferred from ''[[Hillsfar]]'',<ref name="info37"/> another contemporaneous ''AD&D''-based game. The [[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|paladin]] and [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|ranger]] are two new [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character classes]] available in this game.<ref name="TGM22"/><ref name=tresca2010>{{citation |first1=Michael J. |last1=Tresca |title=The Evolution of Fantasy Role-Playing Games |publisher=McFarland |year=2010 |isbn=978-0786458950 |page=142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H8bzqj6S4sC&pg=PA142}}</ref> A player can generate new characters, choosing the options for each character from six races, nine [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignments]], two genders, and six [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character classes]].<ref name="Zzap53"/> Multi-class characters can be created for [[Half-elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|half-elf]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elf]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarf]], [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|halfling]], and [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnome]] characters.<ref name=manual>{{cite book |title=Curse of the Azure Bonds ''Manual'' |year=1989 |publisher=TSR, Inc.}}</ref>  New characters begin with 25,000 [[experience point]]s,<ref name=manual/> which starts single-class characters at level 5.<ref name="CGW63"/>  Multi-classed characters have the total number of experience points divided equally amongst their classes,<ref name=manual/> giving either 12,500 or 8,333 experience points, for two or three classes, respectively. This means multi-class characters generally start at level 4,<ref name="CGW63"/> although a triple-classed character would start as a level 3 magic-user.  The player can adjust the statistics for any character before beginning the game.<ref name="CGW63"/>

''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' uses the style from ''Pool of Radiance'', with the main adventuring action using a first person perspective.<ref name="CU A-64"/> The player uses the top left window to view the current location and move, and can view the status panel on the right and select from the commands along the bottom. Using these commands, the player can select from a range of actions and tasks including casting spells, switching weapons, or resting and preparing spells for the day.<ref name="Zzap53"/> The player creates an icon to represent each character,<ref name="CGW63"/> which can be customized to taste.<ref name="Zzap53"/>

During combat, the screen display changes so that the right half of the screen becomes the status panel, and the left half shows an overhead view of the combat. Characters can use spells and ranged weapons by lining up their targets.<ref name="Zzap53"/>

===Game differences===
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2014}}
''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' contained new features compared to its predecessor, ''[[Pool of Radiance]]''. The game primarily takes place in the [[Dalelands]], and the overland map allows a player to select an adjacent location and automatically travel there. There are random encounters with monsters when traveling to locations. The player may now choose the classes of paladin and ranger for characters in addition to fighter, thief, magic-user, and cleric. A ''Fix'' command was added to the ''Encamp'' menu, which allows a party to be healed very quickly as long as a living and conscious cleric or paladin is in the party.<ref name="Dragon149"/> The graphics were improved slightly, though everything was still drawn in [[EGA graphics|16 colors]].

==Plot==
===Setting===
''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' takes place in the [[Forgotten Realms]] setting. The adventure begins in the city of Tilverton, a relatively small town that nonetheless contains sufficient shops and services to equip the party.<ref name="Zzap53"/> Although the characters begin the game with no equipment, each character does receive money at the start of the game with which to buy weapons and armor.<ref name="CGW63"/> Outside the city of Tilverton, the characters may explore caverns, sewers, and the wilderness outside. Other locations include the Elven Forest, Zhentil Keep, the temple at Yulash, and the citadel at Hap,<ref name="Zzap53"/> though these locations cannot be freely explored by the party. Instead, the player can use a menu to select places within the locations to visit. Yulash is under siege by marauders, and characters entering the town are also in danger from crumbling walls and sinkholes.<ref name="CGW63"/>

===Plot summary===
At the start of the game, the player characters are adventurers of great renown who wake up from a magic sleep to find themselves in a small inn in the city of Tilverton, with all of their possessions stolen and no memory of how it happened.<ref name="Zzap53"/> A landlord passing by informs the characters that they have been unconscious for over a month after suffering an attack.<ref name="CU A-64"/> Each of the player characters has five azure-colored markings similar to tattoos, called ''bonds'', on one arm.<ref name="CU A-64"/> The party had been ambushed while traveling on the road to Tilverton.<ref name="CGW63"/> They were taken captive and cursed with the magical bonds embedded on their arms; the quest for the characters is to get rid of these bonds.<ref name="TGM22"/> Characters can visit the sage Filani, who will give them information about the bonds.<ref name="CGW63"/> Each of these bonds represents a separate evil faction,<ref name="CGW63"/> and through the bonds, which glow when active and are the result of a spell with an affect similar to possession, the factions can control the actions of the characters.<ref name="CU A-64"/>

The first bond forces the characters to attack the passing royal carriage, resulting in a fight with the royal guards.<ref name="CU A-64"/> The characters begin searching for the first controlling faction, a band of assassins known as the Fire Knives. After defeating the Fire Knives which eliminates the first bond, the characters are banished from Tilverton for trying to kill the King. The characters may then journey to [[Shadowdale (Forgotten Realms)|Shadowdale]] or Ashabenford. The player then spends the rest of the game deciding where to go next to remove another bond.<ref name="CGW63"/> As the story continues, the adventurers confront the King of [[Cormyr]] and his daughter the princess, save Dimswart the Sage, find three artifacts, and investigate Dagger Falls.<ref name="Zzap53"/> Princess Nacacia of Cormyr went missing a year ago, when she fled a marriage that her father arranged, and it is up to the party to find her.<ref name="AA16"/> The game combines mini-adventures with major adventures in the quest of the party to remove the Azure Bonds. The climax of the game features a battle against an old foe back from the dead.<ref name="Zzap53"/>

The remaining four bonds are controlled by Mogion, leader of the cult of [[Moander]], Dracandros the Red Wizard, [[Fzoul Chembryl]] and his [[Beholder (Dungeons & Dragons)|beholder]] allies, and Tyranthraxus, the main antagonist from ''Pool of Radiance''. The cult of Moander is based in Yulash, where the characters encounter [[Alias (Forgotten Realms)|Alias]] and [[Dragonbait]], who can join the party. After defeating the cult, the party must also defeat three Bits O' Moander, which behave as powerful shambling mounds. Dracandros is found in the Red Tower in Haptooth, and the characters will face a beholder in [[Zhentil Keep]], along with a group of [[Minotaur (Dungeons & Dragons)|minotaurs]] and a medusa.<ref name="CGW63"/>

After removing two bonds, the player gains the ability to use the ''Search'' command on the wilderness map to locate mini-dungeons under certain towns; these caverns are dangerous, but the party can gain both [[Experience point|experience]] and treasure in them.<ref name="CGW63"/> When the player has successfully removed four of the bonds, the characters will need to fight Tyranthraxus, who takes the form of a [[Giant (Dungeons & Dragons)|storm giant]], in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. After defeating Tyranthraxus, the game is over.<ref name="CGW63"/>

==Development==
The game includes a manual to explain its game play, and an ''Adventurer's Journal'' which contains contextual paragraphs intended to be read at specific points during the game. The game also includes a 2-ply [[code wheel]] featuring [[runes]] for protection against game piracy; on occasion during play, the player will be asked to enter a letter from the wheel before the characters can continue their journey.<ref name="CGW63"/>

''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' (1989) was the first of three sequels to ''Pool of Radiance'' (1988), and was followed by ''[[Secret of the Silver Blades]]'' (1990) and ''[[Pools of Darkness]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Barton |date=23 February 2007 |work=The History of Computer Role-Playing Games |title=Part 2: The Golden Age (1985-1993) |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070223b/barton_04.shtml |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |access-date=26 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227174428/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070223b/barton_04.shtml |archive-date=27 February 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Players of ''Secret of the Silver Blades'' may begin the game by using characters previously generated in ''Curse of the Azure Bonds''.<ref name="Dragon162">{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser |last2=Lesser |last3=Lesser |first1=Hartley |first2=Patricia |first3=Kirk |journal=Dragon |issue=162 |date=October 1990 |pages=50}}</ref> ''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' was released on the Apple II, Commodore 64, and DOS in 1989, the Amiga and Macintosh in 1990, and the Atari ST in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title=Curse of the Azure Bonds |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/curse-of-the-azure-bonds |publisher=[[MobyGames]] |access-date=11 September 2009}}</ref> It was distributed in the UK by [[U.S. Gold]].<ref name="TGM22"/><ref name="CU A-64"/> A Nintendo [[SNES]] videogame version was planned as a sequel to the [[NES]] conversion of ''Pool Of Radiance'', but was abandoned; the publisher in both cases was [[Fujisankei Communications International|FCI]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587518-advanced-dungeons-and-dragons-pool-of-radiance/faqs |title=Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Pool of Radiance FAQs, Walkthroughs, and Guides for NES - GameFAQs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Curse of the Azure Bonds...there were plans to remake it for the SNES |url=http://tv-games.narod.ru/snes/games/a2.htm}}</ref>

The novel ''Azure Bonds'' is a [[Forgotten Realms]] fantasy adventure book, written by [[Jeff Grubb]] and [[Kate Novak]] and published by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] in 1988. The story begins with an adventurer named [[Alias (Forgotten Realms)|Alias]] awakening in an inn with amnesia and a set of magical blue sigils on her arm.

''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' was almost as successful as ''Pool of Radiance'', with SSI selling 179,795 copies. More than one third were the Commodore 64 version, benefiting from SSI being the last major American publisher of games for the computer.<ref name="maher20170331">{{Cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2017/03/opening-the-gold-box-part-5-all-that-glitters-is-not-gold/ |title=Opening the Gold Box, Part 5: All That Glitters is Not Gold |last=Maher |first=Jimmy |date=31 March 2017 |website=The Digital Antiquarian}}</ref> By 1996, the ''Pool of Radiance'' series had reached combined global sales above 800,000 copies.<ref name=800k>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961119114425/http://www.ssionline.com/cgi-bin/omixlink?709815180+insider/corporate/corporate.html |url=http://www.ssionline.com/cgi-bin/omixlink?709815180+insider/corporate/corporate.html |title=SSI Corporate Background |publisher=[[Strategic Simulations, Inc.]] |archive-date=19 November 1996 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the August 1989 edition of ''[[Commodore User|CU Amiga-64]]'', Tony Dillon commented that "the graphics are more or less the same as [''Pool of Radiance''], which is no bad thing, and thankfully the game is still as entertaining and involving as the original". He noted that the game's first-person perspective is similar to that of ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]'', and also features an overhead view similar to that of ''[[Gauntlet (arcade game)|Gauntlet]]''. He gave the game an excellent overall score of 89%.<ref name="CU A-64">{{cite journal |last=Dillon |first=Tony |date=August 1989 |title=Curse of the Azure Bonds |journal=[[Commodore User|CU Amiga-64]] |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_705_pages |pages=33}}</ref>

In the August 1989 edition of ''[[The Games Machine]]'' (issue 21), Paul Rigby previewed the upcoming release of ''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' and noted he had not been happy with ''Pool of Radiance'', which he felt was more like basic ''D&D'' due to certain classes, spells, and other elements being unavailable. However he believed that ''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' would allay his criticism, noting that "six extra character classes, 20 extra high-level spells and a bunch of new monsters make ''CAB'' a very promising product".<ref name="TGM21">{{cite journal |last=Rigby |first=Paul |title=The Adventure Strategy Roleplay Column |journal=[[The Games Machine]] |issue=21 |date=August 1989 |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_834_pages |page=85}}</ref> In the following issue of ''The Games Machine'', Rigby reviewed the actual game, and confirmed that he considered it to be a dramatic improvement over ''Pool of Radiance'', with introduction of new classes, better storylines, and an improved combat engine. He concluded by giving ''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' an excellent overall score of 90%: "Overall, ''CAB'' is an excellent RPG, much improved and polished over ''POR'' [...] With a good storyline and excellent graphics, ''CAB'' is recommended whatever version you have".<ref name="TGM22">{{cite journal |last=Rigby |first=Paul |title=The Adventure Strategy Roleplay Column |journal=[[The Games Machine]] |issue=22 |date=September 1989 |url=https://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-22/page/n79/mode/2up |page=80}}</ref>

In the September 1989 edition of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' (issue 63), [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] reviewed the PC version and was critical of certain elements: she found the ending disappointing; believed that the game speed — which had been slow in ''Pool of Radiance'' — was still a problem; was disappointed that little was added to the game except for the ranger and paladin class; and that the emphasis was still on hack-and-slash as opposed to puzzle-solving and genuine role-playing. Scorpia concluded the review by calling the game a "standard follow-up", saying it was "better than ''POR'' in some ways", but that "combat still predominates".<ref name="CGW63">{{cite magazine |title=Curse of The Azure Bonds |author=Scorpia |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=63 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_63/page/n7/mode/2up |date=September 1989 |pages=8–9, 46}}</ref> In a retrospective review in 1993, Scorpia called the game a "sequel to ''Pool of Radiance'' with a bit more plot" and "mainly hack'n'slash leading up to the usual 'Kill [the evil villain]' ending".<ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 |title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1993 |access-date=25 March 2016 |author=Scorpia |pages=34–50}}</ref>

The September 1989 edition of ''[[Zzap!64|Zzap]]'' (issue 53) featured a review of the Commodore 64 version. The reviewer felt that the addition of more character classes "allows the player more choice and a lot more scope to create a truly mixed band of adventurers, mirroring the original RPG well". The reviewer also felt the monsters were better drawn and the game's plot had more depth than previous RPGs from SSI, although some innovation was lost because the game is a sequel. However, the reviewer said that "with its intricate plot and superb player interaction ''Curse'' creates a very strong atmosphere with authenticity lent to the proceedings by the mass of options and the well executed tactical combat display". The reviewer concluded by giving the game an above-average rating of 86%.<ref name="Zzap53">{{cite journal |title=Pool of Radiance |url=https://archive.org/details/zzapp_64_issue_053_600dpi/page/n21/mode/2up |publisher=[[Zzap!64|Zzap]] |issue=53 |date=September 1989 |pages=22–23}}</ref>

In the September 1989 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (issue 149), Patricia Hartley and Kirk Lesser found that "both the user's manual and the Adventurer's Journal [...] are extremely well written". The pair also admired the number of encounters — more than in other adventure games — and the number of hours required to play, more than 120 hours by their count. They concluded by giving the game a perfect rating of 5 out of 5: "As the adventure continues, you'll find that tearing yourself away from ''CAB'' is the most difficult decision of all".<ref name="Dragon149">{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser |last2=Lesser |last3=Lesser |first1=Hartley |first2=Patricia |first3=Kirk |journal=Dragon |issue=149 |date=September 1989 |pages=76–78}}</ref>

In the November 1989 edition of ''[[Games International]]'', Jamie Thomson commented that "the plot is good enough, although not that original for games of this kind", although he liked the role-playing aspects of the game, calling it "a role-playing computer game in one of the purist (''sic'') forms I have yet encountered [...] surprisingly one of the best I have tried (and one of the very few I've had the enery to play to the bitter end)". Thomson concluded by giving the game above average scores of 4 out of 5 for both game play and graphics.<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine |last=Thomson |first=Jamie |date=November 1989 |title=Curse of the Azure Bonds |journal=[[Games International]] |issue=10 |pages=50}}</ref>

In the January 1991 edition of ''Amiga Action'' (issue 16), Doug Johns and Alex Simmons reviewed the [[Amiga]] version of ''Curse of the Azure Bonds''. Johns felt that it was a very good RPG worth getting hold of, although he felt it was a bit too similar to other ''AD&D'' computer games and less polished than ''[[Champions of Krynn]]''. Simmons found the game decidedly average and less appealing compared to previous releases such as ''Champions of Krynn'', but felt that RPG fanatics who enjoyed SSI's other titles should consider purchasing it. They concluded by giving it an average rating of 72%.<ref name="AA16">{{cite journal |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_89_pages |title=Curse of the Azure Bonds |first1=Johns |last1=Doug |first2=Alex |last2=Simmons |journal=[[Amiga Action]] |issue=16 |date=January 1991 |pages=72}}</ref>

In the March 1991 edition of ''[[.info (magazine)|.info]]'' magazine (issue 37), Judith Kilbury-Cobb reviewed the Amiga version, and felt that the graphics and animation were noticeably improved, and that combat encounters were still emphasized while being made more manageable. She concluded by giving the game an above-average rating of four out of five, calling it "most playable ''AD&D'' game yet".<ref name="info37">{{cite journal |last=Kilbury-Cobb |first=Judith |date=March 1991 |title=New Diversions |journal=[[.info (magazine)|.info]] |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_1673_pages |pages=40}}</ref>

The January 1991 edition of ''Zzap'' reviewed the Amiga version, noting that this version of ''Curse'' is "a game that has fallen victim to the steady trudge of progress". The reviewer felt that the game was so dated by 1991 that Amiga ''AD&D'' devotees might want to buy the game to add it to their collections, but the reviewer could not "help but wonder why SSI have bothered to release this conversion when they should be concentrating on bringing prompt Amiga versions of their newer titles". The reviewer concluded by giving the game an average rating of 71% overall.<ref name="Zzap69">{{cite journal |title=Curse of the Azure Bonds |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_1287_pages |publisher=[[Zzap!64|Zzap]] |issue=69 |date=January 1991 |pages=41, 43 |access-date=11 September 2009}}</ref>

The January 1991 issue of the German gaming magazine ''Amiga Joker'' wrote that "''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' is once again [''Advanced Dungeons and Dragons''] at its finest ... the combat is the best thing that the game has to offer, and has lots of variation therein". The reviewer criticized the small field of view as well as the sound effects and music, which they gave a poor score of 33%. They were frustrated by the dated controls and furthermore criticized its similarity to the rest of the series, saying "the presentation of the game is admittedly the same as its predecessors ... and looks more like C64 rather than Amiga. This goes for the graphics as well as the infrequent sound effects, but applies most of all to the controls, with which one must laboriously agonise through the menus". The reviewer concluded by giving the Amiga version an average overall score of 74%.<ref name=joker>{{cite magazine |title=Curse of the Azure Bonds Review |date=January 1991 |url=https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Joker_1991-01_Joker_Verlag_DE/page/n77 |magazine=Amiga Joker |publisher=Joker Verlag |page=78}}</ref>

A retrospective article on the website [[GameSpot]] titled "History of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" commented that "in terms of gameplay and structure, ''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' followed its predecessor more or less directly, though it broadened the path considerably". The reviewer mentioned that the game system benefited from material that had been missing from ''Pool of Radiance'', such as the ability for [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|clerics]] and [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|magic-users]] to attain higher character levels, the ability to enlist characters of [[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|paladin]] and [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|ranger]] character classes, and the option for human characters to become dual-class characters.<ref name="GameSpotAD&D">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/history_add/p4_04.html |title=GameSpot's History of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons |website=[[GameSpot]] |access-date=1 September 2009 |archive-date=5 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105065817/http://www.gamespot.com/features/history_add/p4_04.html |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the 2003 book ''High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games'', Rusel DeMaria and Johnny Wilson related that SSI ran into a play balance dilemma by allowing players to import experienced characters from ''Pool of Radiance''. In order to make the game playable for both beginners and players with built-up characters, the designers had most of the characters' weapons and equipment stolen at the beginning of the game. SSI received criticism for this decision, and had to come up with new solutions to balance play in future games.<ref name="HighScore">{{cite book |last=DeMaria |first=Rusel |author2=Johnny L.

In a retrospective review in 2004, the website ''GameSpy'' commented that ''Azure Bonds'' was a worthy addition to the series, and was, in many aspects, superior to its predecessor.<ref name="rausch04">{{cite web |first=Allen |last=Rausch |date=15 August 2004 |title=A History of D&D Video Games |publisher=GameSpy |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538865p3.html |access-date=23 December 2009}}</ref>
