==Gameplay==
According to the game's preamble, a [[prophet]] has determined that within the next seven years, there will be a [[world war]] which is instigated by a "mysterious leader"; so terrible that the [[Italy|Italians]] have already surrendered and so violent that the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] will be involved.  To avoid this fate, six world leaders have agreed to duke it out - the winner being the undisputed ruler of the world.

The player chooses one of six world rulers of the 1980s: [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], and [[P. W. Botha]]. The game selects a random opponent and the player's character travels to the country of the world leader to duke it out in a best of three fight.  [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] adjudicates and comments on the fights, appearing in a [[postage stamp]] at all times.

Being launched on an [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-Bit]] gaming platform, the fights are two dimensional with the characters being limited in moves they can perform.  The characters can attack on the ground or in the air through jumping and each has special moves - Khomeini can land damage by using his [[beard]] as a third fist while Thatcher can [[headbutt]] opponents.  Each character can call an [[Personal assistant|aide]] twice in a fight to assist them.  This aide typically throws some sort of [[projectile]] in the melee which has a specific [[arc (projective geometry)|arc]] so a seasoned player can avoid the attack.

After all five opponents have been defeated, the player has to fight the "mysterious leader".  Elizabeth announces that the [[mud wrestling]] equipment from [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip's]] last party is still available and the fight takes place in the dark as someone switches out the lights.  Mud occasionally stains the screen and the only clue as to the whereabouts of the player's opponent and the player's character are their eyes.

If the player is able to beat the "mysterious leader", it is revealed that all this was a ploy for [[John Rambo]] to take over the world and the game ends.

There is also a two-player mode available where the opponents can do combat at any of the six main game locations (non-story mode).

== Reception ==
''[[Zzap!64]]'' rated it as 39% in issue 47.  It was praised for its excellent rendition of the ''Spitting Image'' theme tune however.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}
