==Gameplay==
[[File:Top_Gun_TSM_jet,_parachute,_explosion.gif|thumb|right|A high-resolution graphic after player 1 wins]]
The player assumes the role of Maverick in an [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14 Tomcat]] as he is summoned for a new operation, divided into three missions. The enemy is not explicitly identified but boss characters are all highly advanced [[Soviet Union]] prototypes from the time, and the enemy aces have stereotypical Russian-styled names such as "Gorky", "Demitri", and "Stalin". The first mission is to destroy the enemy's [[Tupolev Tu-160]] Blackjack. The second mission is to destroy an advanced version of a [[Mil Mi-24]] Hind helicopter, through an obstacle course through a forest. The third and final mission is to destroy an enemy "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|star wars]] [[Buran programme|space shuttle]]", with two obstacle courses of avoiding lightning bolts and laser beams. Aside from the mission mode, the player can select a one-on-one dogfight mode against seven aces or another player.<ref name="TG2 manual">{{cite book | type=instruction manual | title=Top Gun: The Second Mission | url=http://www.nesworld.com/manuals/topgun2.txt | date=January 1990 | publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] | author=[[Konami]] | access-date=January 2, 2021}}</ref>

The primary weapon of the player's F-14 is its auto-cannon with unlimited ammo; one of three types of missile payloads can be attached, named after their real-life counterparts of [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], [[AIM-7 Sparrow]], and [[AIM-54 Phoenix]]. In the first game, all missiles carried by F-14 are fictional models. In this game, "better" missiles like AIM-54s simply have a larger effective lock-on area. Missiles can be used to lock on and destroy ground targets in-game.

Compared to the previous ''[[Top Gun (1987 video game)|Top Gun]]'' game, this features greatly improved graphics, in-game music (which appears in both the Japanese Famicom version and the arcade version of the first game), and an easier carrier landing sequence. A one or two player versus mode can [[dogfight]].
