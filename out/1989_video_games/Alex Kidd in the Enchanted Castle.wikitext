{{nihongo|'''''Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle'''''|アレックスキッド 天空魔城|Arekkusu Kiddo Tenkū Majō}} is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] developed and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]]. It is the only 16-bit platform game starring [[Alex Kidd]], and the fifth game in the [[Alex Kidd#Games|''Alex Kidd'' series]] of video games.

''Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle'' follows Alex as he fights his way through the fictional planet Paperock in search of his long-lost father, King Thor. Alex has access to several items and vehicles that help him complete his quest, including a motorbike, a pedicopter and a pogo stick, which each give him unique abilities. While traveling through eleven worlds, Alex must defeat several opponents in "Paper, Rock, Scissors" before finally finding King Thor.

==Gameplay==

The player guides Alex through eleven stages by fighting and avoiding enemies and obstacles. Alex can jump, kick, crawl or punch enemies, causing them to explode into gold coins, called Baums. New items and vehicles are gained by playing [[Janken]] ([[rock paper scissors]]) in gambling houses, including the [[motorbike|Sukopako Motorcycle]], the pedicopter (a small pedal-powered [[helicopter]]), a [[pogo stick]] and wizard cane which allows Alex to float in the air for a few seconds. One hit from any enemy causes Alex to die instantly.

In the original [[Japan]]ese version of the game, when Alex or his opponent lose a Rock Paper Scissors match, the loser's clothes disappear, leaving him/her naked with a [[fig leaf]] over his/her genitalia. In the Western versions, the loser is flattened by a heavy weight. Several levels were also renamed for the Western release.

==Plot==
The story continues that of ''[[Alex Kidd in Miracle World]]'' (1986).  Alex lives on Planet Aries which is ruled by his brother, King Igul. After hearing a rumor that his long-lost father, King Thor, is still alive on Planet Paperock, Alex travels to the planet to search for him.

Thomas, reviewing the game for ''[[IGN]]'', gave the game a 4.5/10, criticising the game's "floaty play control" and the [[Rock paper scissors|Rock, Paper, Scissors]] boss battles, lamenting: "It's all very random, and it's not fun at all". Thomas also commented that "You'll understand why [[SEGA]] dropped [Alex Kidd]".<ref name="IGN"/> Frank Provo of [[GameSpot]] had similar problems with the game, also criticising the controls and stating that "Alex slides around like his feet are coated with oil". Provo additionally disapproved of the game's level design, calling it "unremarkable" and that "the game's 11 stages are short left-to-right strips peppered with the same rocks, trees, breakable bricks and generic enemies." He gave ''Enchanted Castle'' 3.8/10.<ref name="Gamespot">{{cite web|last=Provo|first=Frank|date=April 18, 2007|title=Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alex-kidd-in-the-enchanted-castle-review/1900-6169314/|url-status=live|work=Review|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|access-date=2014-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109112026/http://www.gamespot.com:80/reviews/alex-kidd-in-the-enchanted-castle-review/1900-6169314/ |archive-date=2013-11-09 }}</ref> ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Dan Whitehead gave the game a 4/10, disliking the game's "abominable collision detection" and "infantile effort". Like Thomas, he was dissatisfied with the game's Rock, Paper, Scissors sections, observing that "victory comes from blind luck, you'll sit there ... hoping the law of averages means you'll eventually choose the right option and escape from this ''[[Groundhog Day]]'' gaming hell".<ref name="Eurogamer"/> MegaTech gave a review score of 68% and commenting that the game's graphics and sound are almost Master System standard and saying it's fun to play it does not have the same addictive spark like its predecessors. They recommend the game for ''Alex Kidd'' fans.<ref name="MegaTech"/> ''Console XS'' gave a score of 72%, writing: "This platform adventure has loads of games and is packed with average selection of adversaries but the whole thing gets very boring."<ref name="Console XS"/>
