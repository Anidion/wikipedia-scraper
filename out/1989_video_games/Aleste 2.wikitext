==Gameplay==
{{This section needs expansion|date=October 2023}}
Just like in the first ''[[Aleste]]'', the player controls a spaceship the flies across a scrolling land. It features the same gameplay from its predecessor, with multiple weapons which are equipped by picking the corresponding icon, though this time the player can choose its starting secondary weapon before starting the game, with the chosen weapon becoming more powerful.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the year 2039, two decades after the supercomputer DIA 51 attacked and decimated the Earth. After the long restoration period, Earth is invaded by a race of alien plantlike humanoids called the Vagand, intent on finding a new food source on Earth. In their first attack on Earth, the Vagand destroy an Earth space cruiser commanded by the previous Earth hero, Ray Waizen. Their plan to invade Earth is challenged by the newest version of the Aleste piloted by the daughter of Ray and Yuri Waizen, Ellinor, who has vowed to avenge her father's death and to personally kill the Vagand leader Gaizel.

==Development and release==
Former Compile members Yuichi Toyama and Kazuyuki Nakashima stated that a prototype of ''Aleste 2'' for [[Sega Mega Drive]] was developed but it was ultimately reworked into ''[[MUSHA]]''.<ref name="VGMDBa1">{{cite web|url=https://vgmdb.net/album/35719|title=WMBM-0022~4 &#124; NAXAT SOFT SHOOTING COLLECTION|work=vgmdb.net|publisher=VGMdb|access-date=2020-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108113302/https://vgmdb.net/album/35719|archive-date=2013-01-08|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/compilestg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811021707/http://shmuplations.com/compilestg/|date=2017-08-11}}).</ref>

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
''[[Retro Gamer]]'' included it among top ten MSX games.
