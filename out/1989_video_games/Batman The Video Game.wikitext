'''''Batman: The Video Game''''' is a [[platform game]] developed by [[Sunsoft]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], loosely based on the 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. The game contains five levels culminating in a showdown with the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] in the bell tower of Gotham Cathedral. It was received well.

Sunsoft developed three related games with the same title for the [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], and [[PC Engine]] in 1990.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:Batman (NES) gameplay.png|thumb|200px|left|[[Batman]] being attacked by [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] in the first stage]]
The game has a feature that was unusual in side-scrolling platform games at the time, largely to the NES itself. Unlike Sunsoft's [[Batman (Sega Mega Drive video game)|''Batman'' for the Mega Drive/Genesis]], which features the [[grappling hook]], [[Batman]] has the ability to do a [[wall jump]]. He is able to use three projectile weapons: the [[batarang]], batdisk, and batpoon, which are powered by pellet cartridges.

The stages in the game consists of the Gotham City Streets, Axis Chemical Plant, Gotham Sewers, Mysterious Laboratory, and the Gotham Cathedral Belltower. A number of notable [[DC Comics]] villains appear as low-level minions in the game, including [[Deadshot]], [[KGBeast]], [[Maxie Zeus]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], Shakedown, and [[Nightslayer]].

The bosses in the game are [[Killer Moth]], a device known as the Machine Intelligence System, [[Electrocutioner|the Electrocutioner]], a machine known as the Dual-Container Alarm, [[Firebug (comics)|Firebug]], and the Joker. The penultimate boss will be skipped in the continued play if the player reached the Joker previously, so the player can directly fight the Joker next time.

== Development ==
{{Expand section|date=October 2023}}
The prototype version of the game had some significant differences, such as a 1UP icon and entirely different [[cutscene|cut-scene]]s. The game's original last boss was Firebug and there was no Joker boss. Instead, Batman defeats the Joker in the ending cut-scene. The art and dialogue were changed from the prototype to the final version to better reflect the look and events from the film.<ref name="BTVGNEShg101"/>

==Genesis version==
{{Main|Batman (Sega Genesis video game)}}
A title for [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] was also developed by [[Sunsoft]]. Unlike the NES version, its plot has more similarities to that of the film.

==PC Engine version==
{{Main|Batman (PC Engine video game)}}
''Batman'' for the PC Engine is an action-puzzle game, developed by Sunsoft and released in 1990 only in Japan. For unknown reasons the game was never released in North America for the TurboGrafx-16. There originally was a side scrolling action Batman like the other console versions, but it got canceled at some point and was replaced with what became the released product.
