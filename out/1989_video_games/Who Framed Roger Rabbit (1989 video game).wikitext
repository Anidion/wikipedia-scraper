==Gameplay==

The game takes place in [[Los Angeles]] in 1947.

The player controls private detective Eddie Valiant, who is always closely followed by [[Roger Rabbit]]. The game begins in the city proper, where Valiant and Roger must search buildings to find useful items while avoiding the weasels of Judge Doom's Toon Patrol and other hazards. Benny the Cab can be found or summoned for faster travel on the roads. As the game progresses, the player can travel to both the outskirts of Los Angeles and to Toontown in order to widen the search. Forested areas off the paved roads contain caves which must also be checked for items. In order to complete the game, the player must find all four pieces of Marvin Acme's lost will, then enter a warehouse in Toontown and defeat Doom.

One of the Los Angeles locations that the player can visit is the Ink and Paint Club, where Roger's wife Jessica is performing. She offers hints as to where to find pieces of the will, and a telephone number can be found by searching the tables. When the game was originally released, players could call that number and hear a recording of Jessica giving additional tips on gameplay. The recording is no longer available, and the number has since been reassigned.
