==Gameplay==

The final goal is to reach the "Ultimate Challenge", an endless race filled with surprises, where the player must simply get as far as possible in the allotted time. Markers on the Ultimate Challenge course show the names of the five players who have traveled the farthest, who are tracked independently of the game's traditional high score table.

Twin triggers fire laser cannons mounted atop the craft, and the Start buttons double as the triggers for the Shockwave "smart bomb" weapon.

== Development ==
The game initially began as a remake of Atari's ''Tunnel Hunt''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Never Before Seen Atari Stuff at California Extreme (from Scott Evans) |url=https://rec.games.video.arcade.collecting.narkive.com/uFTeLpYS/never-before-seen-atari-stuff-at-california-extreme-from-scott-evans |access-date=2023-09-02 |website=rec.games.video.arcade.collecting.narkive.com}}</ref>{{notinsource|date=November 2023}}

The Lynx version was programmed by D. Scott Williamson, an employee of Atari who went on to form the development group Solid Software.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-10-10 |title=some pretty awesome graphics for the Lynx! |url=https://forums.atariage.com/topic/188836-some-pretty-awesome-graphics-for-the-lynx/ |access-date=2023-09-02 |website=AtariAge Forums |language=en-US}}</ref>
