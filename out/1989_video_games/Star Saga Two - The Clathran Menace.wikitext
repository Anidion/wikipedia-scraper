'''''Star Saga: Two - The Clathran Menace''''' is a 1989 video game published by [[Masterplay Publishing]].

==Gameplay==
In this title, a gigantic [[Naval fleet|armada]] of alien ships scours the galaxy, seeking to eliminate any and all sentient life.  Players must quickly explore the accessible reaches of space, hoping to uncover technology with which to oppose this threat.

==Reception==
The second game is described as being more difficult than the first, due to frequent conflicts with the Clathran "Survey Line" which inexorably moves across the galaxy.  It's also more linear, in that players are prevented from undertaking certain activities due to current game conditions.<ref name="cgw2">{{Citation | last1=DeNardo | first1=Vince |last2=Lombardi |first2=Chris | title=Star Saga II: Mankind Strikes Back | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | volume=63 | pages=36–37 | date=September 1989 }}</ref>  Nonetheless, the ''Computer Gaming World'' review concludes, "Despite the few faults, ''Star Saga Two'' is a wonderfully written and produced game that can really glue you to the computer."<ref name="cgw2" /> The editors of ''[[Game Player's PC Strategy Guide]]'' gave ''Star Saga Two'' their 1989 "Best PC Science Fiction Game" award. They wrote, "Although darker and more sinister in tone than its predecessor, ''Star Saga: Two'' is still a rollicking, all-stops-out space opera".<ref name=gameplayers1989>{{cite journal | title=''Game Player''{{'}}s First Annual PC Game Awards 1989 | journal=[[Game Player's PC Strategy Guide]] | date=March–April 1990 | volume=3 | number=2 | pages=11, 12 }}</ref>
