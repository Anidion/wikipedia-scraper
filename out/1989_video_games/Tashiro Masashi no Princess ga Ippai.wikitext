One happy ending and four unhappy endings were used in the game; becoming one of the first video games to have [[Types of fiction with multiple endings#Video games|multiple endings]]. The game was not very successful, but it started appearing frequently and getting high prices on [[online auction business model|online auction sites]] like [[Yahoo!]] after 2000, when Masashi Tashiro was arrested and convicted several times in connection with [[voyeurism]] and [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]].
