'''''F-15 Strike Eagle II''''' is an [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E Strike Eagle]] [[Combat flight simulation game|combat flight simulator]] released in 1989 by [[MicroProse]] and is the sequel of ''[[F-15 Strike Eagle (video game)|F-15 Strike Eagle]]''. It was followed in 1992 by ''[[F-15 Strike Eagle III]]'', the final game of the series.

The fighter is equipped with a [[M61 Vulcan]] and three different kinds of missiles, [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|Sidewinders]], [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AMRAAM]]s and [[AGM-65 Maverick|Mavericks]]. ''F-15 Strike Eagle II'' comes with four scenarios: [[Libya]], [[Persian Gulf]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Middle East]]. In a mission the player has to fight a variety of enemy aircraft, missile boats, satellite stations and other ground targets, to take out one primary and one secondary target, making sure to not attack friendly targets. [[promotion (rank)|Promotion]]s and medals are based on the mission score.

''Strike Eagle II'' was very similar in both appearance and game play to MicroProse's previous release, ''[[F-19 Stealth Fighter]]''.<ref name="CGW"/> Like many flight simulators of the time, realism was at times sacrificed due to either computing requirements or playability.

In 1991, a scenario disk was released called '''''F-15 II Operation Desert Storm'''''. It added three new scenarios, two from the earlier ''[[F-19 Stealth Fighter]]'', [[North Cape (Norway)|North Cape]] and [[Central Europe]], and a new scenario based on the contemporary [[Gulf War]] called [[Desert Storm]]. In addition, night missions, improved sound support and new weapons were included.

==Reception==
The game was reviewed positively in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''. The review described it as "a gamer's game", emphasizing the game aspects over the simulation, and notably less complicated than ''F-19 Stealth Fighter''.<ref name="CGW"/> 1992 and 1994 surveys in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game three and a half stars out of five.<ref name="brooks199206">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
