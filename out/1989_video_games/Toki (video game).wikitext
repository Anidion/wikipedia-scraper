'''''Toki'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''JuJu Densetsu'''''|JuJu伝説|''JuJu legend'' or ''Legend of Juju ''||lead=yes}} in Japan.}} is a [[run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] [[platform game]] released in arcades in Japan in 1989 by [[TAD Corporation]]. It was published in [[North America]] by [[Fabtek]]. Designed by [[Akira Sakuma]], the game has [[tongue-in-cheek]] humor mixed with the action. The player controls an [[incantation|enchanted]] [[ape]] who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth. The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] who cast a spell on the title protagonist; thereby transforming him from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several [[video game console]]s and [[home computer]]s.

==Gameplay==
The player must traverse several levels with a [[miniboss]] at the end. Despite his apparent handicap, his slowness as an ape, and the fact that almost any attack can kill him, Toki is able to spit powerful shots that will help him in defeating enemies and obstacles that try to slow him down in his mission.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Alec |date=2018-03-23 |title=Retro Revisited: Toki (Arcade) |url=https://www.vintageisthenewold.com/retro-revisited-grab-your-spittoons-as-we-review-toki-a-classic-arcade-coin-op-by-tad-corporation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210613144458/https://vintageisthenewold.com/retro-revisited-grab-your-spittoons-as-we-review-toki-a-classic-arcade-coin-op-by-tad-corporation/ |archive-date=2021-06-13 |access-date=2022-04-01 |website=Vintage is The New Old |language=en-US}}</ref> There is a timer for each stage.

Toki can make use of items such as power-ups for his spit; lucky rabbit feet which can give Toki bursts of superhuman agility and jumping skill; clocks which add extra time to the countdown; fruit which can add to Toki's bonus points; keys which unlock bonus areas; a special helmet that protects him from upwards attacks (the helmet rather comically resembles an [[American football|American football helmet]]); extra lives; and magic coins (food in the Genesis version) which when collected in abundance can obtain Toki an extra life.

==Plot==
The [[protagonist]] of the game is a muscular, [[loincloth]]-wearing, [[Tarzanesque]] [[tribe]]sman named Toki (known in Japan and in some ports as JuJu), who up until recently lived a primitive yet contented life in the jungles of a vast and wild island in the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]].

This all ends tragically when the beautiful Miho, princess of Toki's tribe of jungle men, and a potential suitor to Toki, is kidnapped by the treacherous [[witch doctor]] Vookimedlo. Miho is taken to a vast golden palace at the summit of the island, which Vookimedlo has conjured up for himself to reside in. The wicked [[Shamanism|shaman]] then casts a spell to transform all the human inhabitants of the island into various animals and beasts, before they can defend themselves against the evil magic.

Toki himself is transformed into a Geeshergam, one of the ape-like minions of Vookimedlo, although in his [[primate]] form, Toki more resembles a [[gorilla]]. Fortunately, the great warrior discovers that he is still in control of his own faculties and as an unexpected side effect of the spell cast on him, he can breathe fire and shoot forth various projectiles from his mouth.

Toki then sets off on a quest to pursue and defeat Vookimeldo, rescue princess Miho, and undo the curse which has befallen the island. However, to reach Vookimedlo's golden palace, Toki will have to travel through murky lakes, steep canyons, over frozen ice-capped mountain ranges and [[lava]]-spewing [[volcano]]es alike. To progress in his quest and be ultimately victorious, Toki will have to battle all manner of dangerous wild animals and various mutants of Vookimedlo's creation; not to mention Vookimedlo's own abominable guardians who act as [[miniboss|level bosses]].

==Ports==
Within the next two years the game was ported to a larger number of [[video game console|home video game consoles]] and home computers of the time. [[Ocean Software]] published versions for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Commodore 64]], They also advertised versions for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] and the Spectrum version was previewed in issue 90 of [[CRASH (magazine)|Crash Magazine]], but neither port materialized. [[Taito]] published ports for the [[Atari Lynx]] and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The latter version of the game was slightly altered and featured a [[Heads-up display (video games)|health bar]] so that Toki didn't die after one hit. [[Sega]] would later reprogram and retool the game into an exclusive version for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] known as ''Toki: Going Ape Spit''. This version lacks the non-spit power-ups, but it features additional levels and more detailed graphics compared to the NES version.

In some ports, Toki is named "JuJu", Miho is named "Wanda" and Vookimedlo is named "Dr. Stark". Also, in some ports it is not Vookimedlo who kidnaps princess Miho, but his chief [[henchman]], the half-[[invisible]] giant known as Bashtar. In some ports Bashtar is the final boss of the game, and not Vookimedlo.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Toki'' on their March 15, 1990 issue as being the sixteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=376|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 March 1990|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>

''Toki'' won a [[Golden Joystick Award]] in 1992.

''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' gave the Amiga version of ''Toki'' an overall score of 88%, calling its gameplay "standard stuff", but praises the variety of gameplay that's outside of the norm, posing such examples as Toki's ability to swim, climb, and ride [[Minecart|trolleys]], stating that these "all help to make it stand out from the current crop of arcade conversions." ''The One'' praises ''Toki's'' gameplay, stating that "the gameplay is so well balanced, becoming gradually harder as you get into it", furthermore stating that this is "exactly the way it should be." ''The One'' also praises ''Toki's'' music and graphics, expressing that "it complements the action perfectly" and "[adds] greatly to the game's appeal", furthermore stating that ''Toki's'' animations add "instant appeal", and calls ''Toki'' "An enjoyable conversion that's as playable as it is pretty".<ref name=theone>{{cite magazine|title = Toki Review|date = July 1991|url = https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-34/page/n53|magazine = The One|publisher = emap Images|last = Watsham|first = Jools|issue = 34|pages = 54–55}}</ref>

[[Destructoid]] praises the game for the [[nostalgia]] it gave to the reviewer. Despite this, they still didn't see it as a great game at all, and stated that it "isn't a perfect game".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-toki/|title=Review: Toki|accessdate=8 April 2023}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
An [[Arcade game|arcade-style]] platform game with similarly-looking simian characters was in development by Ocean Software for the [[Atari Jaguar]] under the working title ''Apeshit'' but was later renamed to ''Toki Goes Apespit'' at one point during development due to Ocean still retaining the license to Toki,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/ocean-power-02#page/n6/mode/1up|title=News: Jaguar - Watch the skies|magazine=Ocean Power|issue=2|publisher=Bastion Publishing|date=Spring 1994|page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Edge_UK_008#page/n31|title=Prescreen - Ocean Software|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|issue=8|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=May 1994|pages=32–33}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ripper|first=The|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_06#page/n131/mode/1up|title=Europa!|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=2|issue=6|publisher=DieHard Gamers Club|date=May 1994|pages=132–134}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Generation%204/generation4_numero066/GEN4%20066%20-%20Page%20014.jpg|title=News - L'ECTS: le fur en marche - La Jaguar montre ses crocs!|magazine=[[:fr:Gen4|Génération 4]]|issue=66|publisher=Computec Media France|date=May 1994|page=14|lang=fr|access-date=2018-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200745/http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Generation%204/generation4_numero066/GEN4%20066%20-%20Page%20014.jpg|archive-date=2018-09-23|url-status=live}}</ref> with plans to be published in Winter 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_07#page/n146/mode/1up|title=The Game Fan 32Bit System Shoot Out - Who Will Lead Us Into The Next Generation?|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=2|issue=7|publisher=DieHard Gamers Club|date=June 1994|pages=146–147}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Hackett|first=Tina|url=http://www.atarimania.com/mags/hi_res/atari-st-user-issue-101_69.jpg|title=Action Feature - The Jaguar: ready to pounce!|magazine=[[Atari ST User]]|issue=101|publisher=[[Europress]]|date=June 1994|pages=68–71|access-date=2018-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927001535/http://www.atarimania.com/mags/hi_res/atari-st-user-issue-101_69.jpg|archive-date=2018-09-27|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=The Laird|url=http://gameon.freeforums.net/thread/118/toki-goes-apeshit-atari-jaguar|title=Toki Goes Apeshit - Atari Jaguar|website=gameon.freeforums.net|date=July 17, 2015|accessdate=2018-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923235132/http://gameon.freeforums.net/thread/118/toki-goes-apeshit-atari-jaguar|archive-date=2018-09-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.janatari.de/atari-jaguar/jaguar-lost-games/|title=Atari Jaguar Lost Games|website=janatari.de|accessdate=2018-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906052745/https://www.janatari.de/atari-jaguar/jaguar-lost-games/|archive-date=2018-09-06|url-status=live}}</ref> However it was never released, likely due to the failure of the Jaguar both commercially and critically.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ripper|first=The|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_12#page/n229/mode/1up|title=Europa!|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=2|issue=12|publisher=Shinno Media|date=December 1994|page=214}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/07/apeshit-atari-jaguar-unreleased/|title=Apeshit [Atari Jaguar – Unreleased]|website=unseen64.net|date=April 7, 2008|accessdate=2018-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923235108/https://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/07/apeshit-atari-jaguar-unreleased/|archive-date=2018-09-23|url-status=live}}</ref>

The original game was also ported by Magic Team for iOS on September 7, 2009 in the United States.

A new, [[independent game developer|independent]] [[video game remake|enhanced remake]] was announced in October 2009. It was being developed by Golgoth Studio and was originally targeted for release on [[Personal computer|PC]] via [[Steam (service)|Steam]], and on home consoles through [[Xbox Live Arcade|XBLA]], [[PlayStation Network]], and [[WiiWare]]. It missed its original 2011 release, and while it wasn't officially cancelled, it was considered [[vaporware]] for years, even after being approved on the (now-retired) [[Steam Greenlight]] service at the end of 2013. However, on April 5, 2018, [[Microïds]] announced that the remake would finally be released on December 4, 2018 for [[Nintendo Switch]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Reseigh-Lincoln|first=Dom|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/04/arcade_classic_toki_will_return_with_a_brand_new_remake_on_nintendo_switch|title=Arcade Classic Toki Will Return With A Brand New Remake On Nintendo Switch|publisher=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=April 5, 2018|accessdate=2018-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710010232/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/04/arcade_classic_toki_will_return_with_a_brand_new_remake_on_nintendo_switch|archive-date=10 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was then announced for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on March 28, 2019, for a Q2 2019 release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2019/03/toki-remake-coming-to-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc-in-q2-2019|title = Toki remake coming to PS4, Xbox One, and PC in Q2 2019|date = 28 March 2019}}</ref> It was then released in June 2019.
