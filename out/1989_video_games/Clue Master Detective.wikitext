==Reception==
M. Evan Brooks reviewed the computer editions of ''[[The Computer Edition of Risk: The World Conquest Game|Risk]]'', ''[[Monopoly (1985 video game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[The Computer Edition of Scrabble|Scrabble]]'', and ''Clue'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "In this reviewer's opinion, ''Scrabble'' is the weakest product (given cumbersome play and graphics), while ''Risk'' and ''Clue: Master Detective'' are the strongest."<ref name="CGW69">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M. Evan |title=CLASSIC CONVERSIONS |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=March 1990 |volume=1 |issue=69 |pages=44â€“45}}</ref>

''[[Run (magazine)|Run]]'' found the need to look at the screen without other players seeing it to be awkward, but complimented the sound, graphics, and strategic elements. The magazine concluded, "It is a very satisfying way to play [[Sherlock Holmes]] on your very own C-64."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Software Gallery: Clue Master Detective |journal=Run |date=November 1991 |volume=8 |issue=6 |page=14 |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_run_november-december-1991_8_6/page/n17/mode/2up}}</ref>
