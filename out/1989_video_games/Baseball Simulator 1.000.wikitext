{{nihongo|'''''Baseball Simulator 1.000'''''|超人ウルトラベースボール||"Choujin Ultra Baseball"}} is a [[baseball]] game released on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]. It was released in 1989 in Japan and in 1990 in North America.

==Gameplay==
In the game, there are four leagues available. The first two contain only normal teams, the third contains only ultra teams, and the fourth allows a player to create their own league from any mixture of normal and ultra teams. A player can either control a normal baseball team or an ultra baseball team with super hitting and pitching plays to boost their chances of winning.

Each Ultra play uses a certain number of points. Ultra points are limited and when they are all used up no more ultra plays can be performed. There are also some Ultra Upgrades, for outfielders and batters. These cost more points to assign, but become intrinsic effects, and do not cost points to use.

Within ''Baseball Simulator 1.000'', there is an [[Exhibition game|exhibition]] mode, a [[regular season]] mode, and a team edit mode that allows the player to make his own players to form a customized baseball team.

A [[magic number (sports)|magic number]] appears during the regular season, telling the leading team how many victories they have to make until they are assured the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]].

A season can be 5, 30, 60, 120, or 165 games. Out of the 18 possible teams, only six teams can be used in a division/league during the season. However, there are no playoffs for the top two teams.  Whoever wins the division is the champion.
