'''''Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero''''' (originally known as '''''Hero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero''''') is a 1989 [[adventure game]]/[[role-playing game]] hybrid, designed by [[Lori Ann Cole]] and published by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]] for [[MS-DOS]]. It is the first game in the ''[[Quest for Glory]]'' series, and has been credited for being a genre-defining game, as it tried to mix graphical adventure gaming with role-playing-like elements such as statistic building (strength, intelligence, health) that would actually affect the ability to accomplish certain parts of the game.<ref name=Eng>{{cite web| url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/05/17/the-glory-of-quest-for-glory/ |title=The glory of Quest For Glory |last=Kaizer |first=Rowan |access-date=11 August 2015}}</ref> The game has a satirical and silly tone.<ref name=DND>{{cite book |last=Barton |first=Matt |date=2014 |title=Dungeons and Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781439865248 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPPRBQAAQBAJ&q=%22quest+for+glory%22+game&pg=PA229 |access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref> Ports for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[NEC PC-9801]] were released in the early 1990s. A [[VGA]] remake, titled ''Quest for Glory I: So You Want to Be a Hero'', was released in 1992 for DOS and later in 1994 for [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]].

==Gameplay==
The original title was an adventure game with a text parser, with players typing commands for the character to perform, while the remake is a point-and-click adventure game.<ref name=Eng/><ref name=IGN>{{cite web| url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/revisiting-quest-for-glory-i-ii |title=Revisiting Quest for Glory I & II |last=Andreadis |first=Kosta |date=2 November 2014 |access-date=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=Poly1>{{cite web| url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/6/5975145/best-games-of-july-2014-the-besties |title=Best games of July 2014 - The Besties |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=6 August 2014 |access-date=10 August 2015}}</ref>

The game advertised itself as "three games in one" since it was the first Sierra game that (according to RPG customs) allowed the selection of a character out of three classes: Fighter, Magic User, and Thief. What class the hero assigns to a character largely determines with what equipment the character begins, how they can solve puzzles and what quests they will run into. However, the distinction between classes was not an absolute one; players could add skills to a character and allow them to complete quests related to other classes in this game and others in the series.<ref name=RPG2>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/qfg/qfg1/reviews/qfg1strev1.html |title=Quest for Glory I: So You Want to Be a Hero - Staff Review |last=Willis |first=Tyler |access-date=10 August 2015 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304211159/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/qfg/qfg1/reviews/qfg1strev1.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''Quest for Glory'' introduced a realism rarely found in RPGs and other adventure games even today. Day, night and the passage of time was a factor; the setting and scenery was different during day and night. The main character had to eat on a regular basis, he would become tired from running and fighting which required rest and sleep. Skills were not obtained by gaining levels through combat, but rather increased distinctly through the regular course of adventuring.<ref name=RPG2/> The more the player used magic, the more the Hero's Magic ability would increase (followed by Intelligence); likewise the more the player engaged in battle, training, or even cleaning the baron's stables, the more the Hero's Strength, Vitality and Agility would increase.

This is one of the few Sierra adventure games where the [[player character]] has few or no speaking lines. Although the player can input commands such as "ask about brigands", the player character has almost no dialogue.

==Plot==
In the valley barony of Spielburg, the evil ogress [[Baba Yaga (Quest for Glory)|Baba Yaga]] has cursed the land and the baron who tried to drive her off. His daughter has disappeared and his son has been transformed into a bear, while the land is ravaged by monsters and [[Outlaw|brigands]].<ref name=PCG>{{cite web| url=http://www.pcgamer.com/saturday-crapshoot-quest-for-glory-4-12/ |title=Saturday Crapshoot: Quest For Glory 4 1/2 |last=Cobbett |first=Richard |website=[[PC Gamer]] |date=9 June 2012 |access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref> The Valley of Spielburg is in need of a Hero able to solve these problems. The player's character is a customized adventurer whose name and class is chosen by the player. The game follows the Hero, who is a recent graduate of the Famous Adventurer's Correspondence School, on his journey into the land.<ref name=RPG2/> He must help people and become a proclaimed Hero.<ref name=RPGamer>{{cite web |url=http://rpgamer.com/games/qfg/qfg1/reviews/qfg1strev2.html |title=Quest for Glory I: So You Want to Be a Hero - Retroview |last=Baker |first=Michael |access-date=11 August 2015 |archive-date=5 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805141031/http://rpgamer.com/games/qfg/qfg1/reviews/qfg1strev2.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The adventurer battles brigands and monsters such as kobolds,<ref name=Eng/><ref name=RPGamer/> solves [[side quests]] (such as finding lost items and spell ingredients) and helps fantasy creatures such as a [[dryad]], a hermit, and a colourful collection of furry creatures called Meeps. Fulfilling quests will grant him experience and money, which he may use to buy equipment and potions. The game is open-ended, which means the player can explore all the game at once and solve the quests in any order. During the quest, the character also meets recurring series characters such as the wizard [[Erasmus (Quest for Glory)|Erasmus]] and his [[familiar spirit|familiar]] [[List of Quest for Glory characters#Fenrus|Fenrus]], and first hears tales of the benevolent faery [[List of Quest for Glory characters#Erana|Erana]].

While the game can be completed without solving the secondary quests, in the optimal ending, which nets the player the maximum score and serves as [[canon (fictional)|canon]] for the remainder of the series, the player frees the baronet from a powerful curse and thwarts the plans of the witch Baba Yaga. Finally, the adventurer frees the baron's daughter, [[List of Quest for Glory characters#Elsa von Spielburg|Elsa von Spielburg]], from the curse which had transformed her into the brigand leader. By doing so, the adventurer fulfills a [[prophecy]], restores Spielburg Valley to prosperity, and is awarded the title of Hero. After this, the Hero, along with the merchant [[List of Quest for Glory characters#Abdulla Doo|Abdulla Doo]] and the innkeepers [[List of Quest for Glory characters#Shameen and Shema|Shameen and Shema]], leaves on a [[magic carpet]] for Shapeir, the homeland of the three, setting the plan for the sequel, ''[[Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire]]''.

==Development==
The idea for ''Quest for Glory'' was that the game should "be as much about story as it was about combat and exploration".<ref name=IGN/> The story and setting are culled from various folklore sources.<ref name=DND/><ref>{{cite journal |date=1995 |title=Quest for Glory I |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j4hVAAAAMAAJ&q=%22quest+for+glory%22 |journal=Macworld |location=USA |publisher=PC World Communications |access-date=12 August 2015 }}</ref>

Many planned features were cut off in the development progress, to release the game in a realistic amount of time. Originally, Lori had planned for four different races: thief-like gnome, magic-wielding elf, human as a jack of all trades, and archer centaur, as well as the option for a female player character. Due to the limited resources available, the development team scaled back these plans, compromising with multiple classes for the human character.<ref name=AG>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/23214/page3 |title=Corey Cole: Recruiting for Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption interview |last=Böke |first=Ingmar |date=9 November 2012 |access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.transolar.com/TSHerosquestnew.html |title=Transolar Games Entertainment: Hero's Quest<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-06-24 |archive-date=2019-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624073155/http://www.transolar.com/TSHerosquestnew.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the original design, there was supposed to be a big goblin maze.

Also, magic users were supposed to be able to get a [[familiar]] like Zara had, but it was cut due to programming difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Live chat with Lori and Corey Cole|date=31 March 2001|url=http://geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arcade/7435/Goodies/ColesChatTranscript.txt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132212/http://geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arcade/7435/Goodies/ColesChatTranscript.txt|archive-date=27 October 2009}} – Lori Cole: ''We wanted to have the Hero be able to have a familiar, like Zara in the first game. That was just too difficult to pull off in programming.''</ref>

The game was originally released as ''Hero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero'' but was re-released in 1990 as ''Quest for Glory I: So You Want to Be a Hero'' because of trademark issues involving the ''[[HeroQuest]]'' board game.

The original game sported [[EGA graphics]], while the remake had VGA graphics.<ref name=RPGamer/>

According to Corey Cole, one of the game's developers and producers, the original ''Quest for Glory'' game cost $150,000 to make, while the VGA remake cost almost as much to make as a full VGA entry.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.destructoid.com/quest-for-glory-developers-only-approached-once-for-a-remake-135372.phtml |title=Quest for Glory developers only approached once for a remake |last=Nicholson |first=Brad |date=9 June 2009 }}</ref><ref name=Int>{{cite web| url=http://www.rpgcodex.net/article.php?id=8549 |title=RPG Codex Interview: Corey Cole on Quest for Glory and Hero-U (Now on Kickstarter!) |date=19 October 2012 |access-date=10 August 2015}}</ref>

==Reception==
''So You Want to Be a Hero'' is credited as a genre-defining video game, due to its mix of adventure and roleplaying elements.<ref name=80s>{{cite book |last=Purcaru |first=Bogdan Ian |date=2014 |title=Games vs. Hardware.

[[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in 1990 that the game's puzzles were easy, but still fun for an experienced player, and that excellent graphics and good use of humor and role-playing elements made the game "a definite winner".<ref name="scorpia199001">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=67 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | title = Hero's Quest I | date=January 1990 | access-date=15 November 2013 | author=Scorpia | pages=20}}</ref> In 1990 the magazine named it as Adventure Game of the Year, describing it as one of the few introductory games that both beginners and veterans of adventures enjoyed.<ref name="cgw199009">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=74 | title=CGW's Game of the Year Awards | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1990 | access-date=16 November 2013 | pages=70}}</ref> In 1993 Scorpia approved of the "cute hybrid's" graphics, humor, and replayability.<ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | access-date=25 March 2016 | author=Scorpia | pages=34–50}}</ref> In 1996, the magazine named ''Quest for Glory'' the 73rd best game ever,<ref name="cgw150">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1996&pub=2&id=148 | title=150 Best Games of All Time | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1996 | access-date=25 March 2016 | pages=64–80}}</ref> and 15th on the magazine's list of the most innovative computer games.<ref name="cgw199611mostinnovative">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1996&pub=2&id=148 | title=The 15 Most Innovative Computer Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1996 | access-date=25 March 2016 | pages=102}}</ref>

The editors of ''[[Macworld]]'' gave ''Quest for Glory'' their 1994 "Best Role-Playing Game" award. Writing about their decision, the magazine's [[Steven Levy]] remarked that the game "merges classic role-playing aspects—building up a character's attributes by vanquishing enemies, all in service of a larger goal—with the more playful mood and interactivity of Sierra On-Line's ''King's Quest'' adventure-game series." He called it "a kinder, gentler form of role-playing game, and one particularly well suited to newcomers to the genre, especially those familiar with adventure gaming."<ref name=macworld1994>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030108175638/http://www.macworld.com/1995/01/features/143.html |url=http://www.macworld.com:80/1995/01/features/143.html |title=1994 Macintosh Game Hall of Fame |author=Levy, Steven |author-link=Steven Levy |work=[[Macworld]] |date=January 1995 |archive-date=January 8, 2003 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Michael Baker of RPGamer scored the game 3.5 out of 5, writing that it is "a piece of RPGaming history that stands the test of time" that balances puzzles, gameplay, and writing to entertaining effect, while finding the game's pacing to be sometimes too slow.<ref name=RPGamer/> Tyler Willis of RPGamer gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, praising especially the personality and presentation of its in-game locations and characters.<ref name=RPG2/> Richard Cobbett for PC Gamer stated that his impressions of the game are "almost all" positive, especially for the VGA remake, due to the great adventure offered and the spectacular game world.<ref name=PCG/>

The game sold 130,000 copies in its first year of release.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Stuart |date=June 1991 |title=Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire |url=https://www.amigareviews.leveluphost.com/questgl2.htm |journal=[[Amiga Power]] |issue=2 |pages=85 |access-date=18 August 2023}}</ref> According to Corey Cole, the game became one of Sierra's fastest-selling products, selling over 250,000 copies in its first few years.<ref name=AG/>

==Remake==
[[File:ScreenShotQuestForGlory1Game.jpg|thumb|Combat in the 1992 remake]]

Like the first games in the ''[[King's Quest]]'', ''[[Space Quest]]'', ''[[Police Quest]]'', and ''[[Leisure Suit Larry]]'' series, a [[VGA]] version using Sierra's point and click SCI1.1 interpreter was released in 1992 for the [[DOS]] and [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]]. This version had input limitations compared to the original, which used the text-parser–based SCI0. The VGA remake and original version were also released on CD-ROM as part of the 1996 Anthology collection and 1997 Collection Series.

While the original game was based on dialogues and asking questions in order to obtain some background information, in the new interface the dialogues had a tree structure: a menu of question topics. By asking certain questions (e.g., "Ask about Potion"), the player will get new questions to ask (e.g., "Healing potion", "Stamina potion", "Dispel potion"). The backgrounds and characters were hand drawn and scanned, while the monster fights and character portraits were made using clay models and [[stop motion]] animation. Unlike other games, running out of stamina points here can kill the hero outright instead of starting to do health damage. Some easter eggs were also updated, for example in Erasmus's house, the original has a reference to ''[[King's Quest IV]]'', while the [[Video game remake|remake]] has a reference to ''[[The Dagger of Amon Ra]]''. The treasure room in the troll cave leading to the Brigand's hideout was missing in the remake.

According to Corey Cole, Lori Cole was responsible for the design of both the VGA remake and ''[[Quest for Glory III: Wages of War]]'', which she worked on at the same time.<ref name=AG/> The box art for the remake is reminiscent of the famous painting of [[Saint George and the Dragon]].<ref name=RPGamer/>
