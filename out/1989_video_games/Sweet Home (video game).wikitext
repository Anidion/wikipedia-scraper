'''''Sweet Home'''''{{efn|In Japanese: {{Nihongo||スウィートホーム|Suwīto Hōmu|lead=yes}}}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Capcom]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in 1989. It was developed alongside the [[Sweet Home (1989 film)|horror film of the same name]] and tells the story of a team of five filmmakers exploring an old mansion in search of precious [[fresco]]s hidden there. As they explore the mysterious mansion, they encounter hostile ghosts and other supernatural enemies. The player must navigate the intricately laid out mansion, battling with the enemies, and the five main characters with the limited weapons and health restorative items available. The narrative moves forward regardless of whether the characters stay alive, and leads to its five different endings.

The game was directed by [[Tokuro Fujiwara]], who previously worked primarily on arcade games such as ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)|Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' (1985). Fujiwara toured the film's set to gather inspiration for the game, and the film's director [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]] gave Fujiwara permission to take some liberties with the game's script. Both the game and film were produced by filmmaker [[Juzo Itami]]. ''Sweet Home'' was released in December 1989 exclusively in Japan, where it gathered generally favorable reception and was considered better than the film. The game was never localized to western markets, likely because of the game's gruesome imagery and the unpopularity of role-playing games outside Japan.

In retrospect, ''Sweet Home'' is considered a landmark game and is often cited for laying the groundwork for the [[survival horror]] genre. It served as the main inspiration behind [[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|''Resident Evil'']] (1996) which was a massive critical and commercial success, launching [[Resident Evil|a multimedia franchise]]. Later games in the future continue to pull inspiration from the game through the use of [[quick time event]]s, inventory management, and ghost story elements. ''Sweet Home''<nowiki/>'s [[Metroidvania]]-style exploration, storytelling methods, and horror elements have been cited as precursors to key elements found in other successful games decades later.

In the present day, a team of five documentary filmmakers seek to recover the paintings from the abandoned, dilapidated mansion. Upon entering, they are trapped inside by the ghost of an unknown woman, who threatens to kill all trespassers. The team decides to split up and find a way out, but the mansion is both in danger of collapsing and is occupied by countless monsters.

The team find a projection room, where they find a projector that displays an image of a couple and their baby burning. They discover that the ghost is that of Lady Mamiya, Ichirō's wife. It is revealed that thirty years previously, Mamiya's two-year-old son had fallen in the house's incinerator and was burnt alive, and Mamiya attempted to provide playmates for her son by killing several other children. She committed suicide shortly after and her ghost, unable to forgive herself, became trapped in the mansion. The team arrives in the main chamber and confronts Mamiya in a final battle. After defeating her, a rescuer arrives to help them escape from the mansion as it crumbles.

== Development and release ==
''Sweet Home'' was developed by [[Capcom]] and directed by [[Tokuro Fujiwara]]. He had previously directed ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)|Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' (1985) and worked on titles such as [[Commando (video game)|''Commando'']] (1985), ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]'' (1987), ''[[Mega Man 2]]'' (1988), and [[Strider (arcade game)|''Strider'']] (1989). ''Sweet Home'' was one of his first [[console game]] projects after working primarily on [[arcade game]]s. At times he was frustrated by the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (Famicom)'s graphics limitations.<ref name="interview"/>

The game is based on the 1989 film of the same name. [[Juzo Itami]], the film's executive producer, and [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], its director, served as the game's producer and supervisor respectively.<ref name="hg101"/><ref>{{cite video game| title = Sweet Home| developer = Capcom| publisher = Capcom| date = 1989| platform = Family Computer| scene = Credits}}</ref> Fujiwara took a tour of the film studio to gather ideas to build the game.<ref name="interview" /> Kurosawa told Fujiwara to not concern himself with following the movie exactly.<ref name="interview" /> Some of the items Fujiwara wanted to include in his game were ultimately left out because they did not match the atmosphere of the film.<ref name="interview" /> The game's plot ended up diverging somewhat from the film's.

== Legacy ==
In retrospect, ''Sweet Home'' is considered one of the greatest horror games ever made and a landmark in the evolution of horror game design. It is often cited for laying the groundwork for the [[survival horror]] genre.<ref name="destructoid" /><ref name="UGOsweethome" /><ref name="kotaku" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name="CVG" /> Allistair Pinsof of ''[[Destructoid]]'' believed ''Sweet Home'' to be the single best Famicom game and dubbed it "one of the very best games ever made". He also called it one of the first games to realize the potential of a fully cohesive world as in the [[Metroidvania]] genre (even though ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' (1986) attempted it first), and one of the first to use scattered notes and diary logs to tell a story, an element later popularized by ''[[BioShock]]'' (2007).<ref name="destructoid" /> Peter Tieryas of ''[[Kotaku]]'' wrote that ''Sweet Home'' successfully fused the RPG, [[Adventure game|adventure]], and horror genres into a "macabre" in a way most other games rarely have.<ref name="kotaku" /> Marty Sliva of ''[[1UP.com]]'' wrote that this mixture of genres was a precursor to ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'' (1998).<ref name="1up" /> Ben Reeves of ''[[Game Informer]]'' called it a cult hit and Tokuro Fujiwara's most significant contribution to the video game industry. He continued by saying the entire horror genre "owe[s] a blood debt to this long-forgotten 8-bit game that had no right to be as good as it was."<ref name=":0" />

The horror elements of ''Sweet Home'' have received significant praise. Critics believe the game successfully created a haunting experience despite the limited technical capabilities of the Famicom hardware.<ref name="destructoid" /><ref name="kotaku" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/05/matters_of_import_survival_horror_in_a_sweet_home|title=Matters Of Import: Survival Horror In A Sweet Home|last=Brunskill|first=Kerry|date=26 May 2014|website=Nintendo Life|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926185212/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/05/matters_of_import_survival_horror_in_a_sweet_home|archive-date=26 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The staff of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called it "one of the Famicom's finest technical hours."<ref name="CVG" /> Tieryas wrote that technical limitations created opportunities for the designers to implement clever gameplay which contributed to the sense of horror.<ref name="kotaku" /> Pinsof agreed and praised the game's structure for creating a tense atmosphere. He wrote that the mansion feels unpredictable and the game is paced well, providing items at just the right moment to maintain the tension. He also praised the innovative and gruesome cinematic imagery.<ref name="destructoid" /> Sliva believed the game had an impressive cinematic quality to it.<ref name="1up" />

=== Influence on ''Resident Evil'' ===
''Sweet Home'' served as the main inspiration for Capcom's ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' (1996), a game which defined the survival horror genre and spawned [[Resident Evil|a multimedia franchise]].<ref name="destructoid" /><ref name="kotaku" /><ref name=":0" /> When development began in 1993, ''Resident Evil'' was originally intended to be a [[Video game remake|remake]] of ''Sweet Home.''<ref name="kotaku" /><ref name="CVG" /><ref name="gamespot-mikami">{{cite web|last1=Butterworth|first1=Scott|title=Resident Evil Creator Shinji Mikami Reflects on the Series' Roots|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami-reflects-on-th/1100-6435918/|website=GameSpot|date=22 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124100824/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami-reflects-on-th/1100-6435918/|archive-date=24 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The game was directed by [[Shinji Mikami]] with Fujiwara acting as producer.<ref name="gamespot-mikami" /> Fujiwara believed the basic premise for ''Resident Evil'' was to do the things that he was unable to include in ''Sweet Home'', particularly in the sense of graphics.<ref name="interview" /> Since Capcom no longer had the rights to the ''Sweet Home'' license, they had to invent a new universe,<ref name="lemonde" /> but the game still adopted many elements from ''Sweet Home''.<ref name="gamespot-mikami" />

Both games placed an emphasis on survival<ref name="UGOsweethome" /><ref name="Sterling" /> with elements such as the management of a limited inventory<ref name="gamespot-mikami" /> and health restoratives scattered throughout the game.<ref name="destructoid" /> ''Resident Evil'' was originally intended to have a first-person perspective influenced by ''Sweet Home''{{'}}s battles, before the perspective was changed during development.<ref name="lemonde" /> Some story elements borrow heavily from ''Sweet Home''. Both games are set in a mansion with an intricate layout,<ref name="destructoid" /> the story is told through the use of scattered notes, and there are [[Types of fiction with multiple endings|multiple endings]] depending on how many characters survive.<ref name="GameSpy" /> Other shared elements include the brutal imagery,<ref name="CVG" /> door loading sequences, puzzles,<ref name="UGOsweethome" /><ref name="Sterling" /> backtracking,<ref name="GameSpy" /> and characters with unique items such as the lockpick and lighter.<ref name="1up" />

''Sweet Home''<nowiki/>'s influence carried further into the series than just the first game. It also inspired ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'' (2002) which allows the player to switch between characters at will and drop items anywhere on the map for the other character to pick up.<ref name="hyper" /> ''Sweet Home''{{'}}s quick time events are considered a precursor to those seen in ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005) and beyond.<ref name="1up" /> ''[[Resident Evil 7]]'' (2017) also shares similarities to ''Sweet Home'', including the plot of a film crew going to an abandoned house, a paranormal female presence in the house, and a tragic tale involving a family that once lived there.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|last1=Moser|first1=Cassidee|title=The Facts, Clues, and Theories of Resident Evil 7|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/95664/the-facts-clues-and-theories-of-resident-evil-7|website=Shacknews|language=en|date=1 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703122102/http://www.shacknews.com/article/95664/the-facts-clues-and-theories-of-resident-evil-7|archive-date=3 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It also pays homage to ''Sweet Home'' in a side story told through a [[VHS]] tape.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/gaming/resident-evil-7-10-facts-secrets-easter-eggs-you-totally-missed|title=Resident Evil 7: 10 Facts, Secrets & Easter Eggs You Totally Missed|date=28 January 2017|website=WhatCulture.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202081158/http://whatculture.com/gaming/resident-evil-7-10-facts-secrets-easter-eggs-you-totally-missed|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Peter Tieryas of ''Kotaku'' blamed the decline in critical acceptance of modern ''Resident Evil'' offerings on Capcom abandoning the basic gameplay design laid out in ''Sweet Home''.<ref name="kotaku" />
