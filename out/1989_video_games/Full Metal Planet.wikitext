==Reception==
Mike Siggins reviewed ''Full Metal Planete'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it 4 stars out of 5, and stated that "I can certainly think of no better company to tackle the conversion of Full Metal Planete and they have done a fine job. I am not sure of the merits of owning the boardgame as well as the computer game but they are both worthy products and, for once, the computer version is cheaper than the boardgame!."<ref name="gi12">{{cite journal | last = Siggins |first = Mike | title =Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 12 | pages =48–49 |date=January 1990}}</ref>

Roger White reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Full Metal Planet'' offers a viable choice for gamers looking for a multi-player strategy game on the computer, a challenging game which can require from a short to medium amount of time to complete and a game that does not follow tried and true formulas of game design."<ref name="CGW80">{{cite magazine |last=White |first=Roger |title=The Tides of Ambition: Data East's Full Metal Planet |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=March 1991 |volume=1 |issue=80 |pages=40, 42}}</ref>

Keith Ferrell for ''[[Compute!]]'' said that "Within its own context, ''Full Metal Planet'' is a solid strategy game. It would be interesting to see what its designers could do with the game's engine by way of offering different planetary surfaces and types. It certainly has potential for creating the basis for a much larger games."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/1991-05-compute-magazine/page/n179/mode/2up | title=Compute!
