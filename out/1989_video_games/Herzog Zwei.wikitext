An early real-time strategy game, it predates the genre-popularizing ''[[Dune II]]''. It was released first in Japan in 1989 and worldwide in 1990.<ref name="1UP">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3134179 | title=Essential Top 50: Herzog Zwei | author=Sharkey, Scott | website=[[1UP.com|1UP]] | access-date=2007-09-27 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120604112047/http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-herzog-zwei | archive-date=2012-06-04 }}</ref> It is the sequel to ''[[Herzog (video game)|Herzog]]'', which was available on the Japanese [[MSX]] and [[PC-8801]] personal computers.

''Herzog Zwei'' combines the arcade-style play of Technosoft's own ''[[Thunder Force]]'' series with a simple, easy-to-grasp level of strategy.

We played for hours on the SEGA. However, Dune was inspired by more than Herzog .. The whole industry was moving to more interactiviity. FTL had Dungeon Master that took the Ultima and Wizardry games to a new level. We were already doing "what if" games like DragonStrike and Eye of the Beholder.At that time it was all about usability, not just about the character or the story. That was the problem with Dune I, it was just Zork with graphics. We wanted to place the player into the environment and let them create their own story. I always felt that Warcraft was a clone of the original Dune. Virgin at that time had a close relationship with Blizard. But now, having years to reflect upon it, I think it was a common synergy going through the industry. There were probably five or six development teams thinking about the same thing. Anyway just my thoughts .. from a guy on the original Dune design team. }}</ref> and is also considered a precursor to the [[MOBA]] genre.<ref name="MCV">{{cite magazine | first=Greg | last=Lockley | date=June 3, 2014 | url=https://www.mcvuk.com/business/moba-the-story-so-far | title=MOBA: The story so far | magazine=[[MCV (magazine)|MCV]]}}</ref><ref name="gamesradar">{{cite web | first=Andrew | last=Groen | date=March 7, 2012 | url=https://www.gamesradar.com/ask-gr-anything-whats-moba/ | title=Ask GR Anything: What's a MOBA? | website=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:MD Herzog Zwei.png|thumb|left|Genesis version]]

The player directly pilots a flying, transforming [[mech]], similar to the [[variable fighter]] depicted in ''[[Macross]]''. It is a multi-role vehicle suited for utility and combat.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/retrogamer_herzogzwei.pdf |magazine=Retro Gamer |issue=28 |last=McFerran |first=Damien |access-date=2011-01-24 |year=2005 |title=Herzog Zwei |archive-date=2014-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403014404/http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/retrogamer_herzogzwei.pdf }}</ref> Through the mech, the player purchases surface combat units, airlifts them across the battlefield, and issues them orders. These command activities can only be performed through the mech. Vehicles follow their assigned orders (patrol, garrison, capture base) until they either run out of fuel or are destroyed. Tactical re-deployment (mission reassignment, vehicle repair) involves a great deal of micromanagement, due to the required involvement of the mech.

Both the player's ground forces and the mech have finite fuel and ammunition. A prolonged engagement requires considerable micromanagement, as vehicles will not auto-repair, and the fragile combat-supply vehicles have a limited radius of service.

With a total of eight different types of land units to purchase, the player can determine the composition of his army. Each combat vehicle type represents a tradeoff between speed, anti-air, ground-attack, and cost. Units are assigned mission orders from a menu selection: "fight from a fixed position", "patrol this area", "fight in fixed radius" and "go to/attack/occupy intermediate base". New orders can only be issued during the airlift, and every time a unit's mission orders are reassigned, a cost is incurred.

In addition to the player's main base, there are nine permanent [[outpost (military)|outpost]]s scattered across the battlefield. These indestructible buildings are the only production resources on the battlefield. Once under a player's control, an outpost generates additional revenue (for purchase of units) and serves as a remote base of operations (repair/refuel, pick up delivery of purchased unit). A key strategy is to capture as many outposts as possible or deny enemy use through nuisance actions.

''Herzog Zwei'' supports both [[single-player]] mode against the AI, as well as a two-player [[multiplayer]] mode. In single-player, the entire screen is devoted to the human-player's field of view. The game partially offsets the AI's inherent weakness by increasing the armor and offensive damage of computer player side with each advancing level.

''Herzog Zwei'' was not a huge commercial success, due to its lack of marketing, relatively early release on the Genesis platform,<ref name="1UP" /> and non-[[Arcade game|arcade]] genre on what was considered an arcade [[Video game console|game console]]. Upon its 1990 release in North America, ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the game a rating of 4.25 out of 10,<ref name=GameRankings>{{cite web|title = Herzog Zwei Reviews|publisher = GameRankings.com|url = http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/473001.asp|access-date = 2009-01-04}}</ref> based on four individual reviewer scores of 4, 6, 4, and 3.<ref>{{cite magazine |year=1993 |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |page=46 }}</ref>

The Mega Drive version's reception in Europe was generally more positive. In the United Kingdom, in the April 1990 issue of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', reviewer Paul Glancey gave the game an 82% score. He described it as "a game of conquest between two commanders in real time" and stated that what "sets it apart from other strategy games is that everything happens in real time. Both players are in action simultaneously and there are no pauses while decisions are taken so you have to think on the move or die". He noted that the command icons are "fairly easy to grasp" and concluded that it is a game that helps establish the Mega Drive as a "real" computer rather than "a machine for immobilized arcade players".<ref name="cvg_zwei"/> Warren Lapworth reviewed the game in the March 1990 issue of ''[[The Games Machine]]'' magazine, giving the game a 75% score. He described it as an "unusual product" and stated that "whether it's intended to get strategists to consider buying the console or to broaden the horizons of trigger-happy lunatics, I don't know. Either way, it's quite refreshing and can be quite addictive in two-player mode, fierce rivalry developing between friends".<ref name="gamesmachine_zwei"/> In France, the game was reviewed in the November 1990 issue of ''[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]'' magazine, where reviewer JM Destroy gave the game a 78% score.<ref name="joystick_zwei">{{cite journal|title=Herzog Zwei|journal=[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]| date=November 1990 |issue=10|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_44262|access-date=4 February 2012|author=JM Destroy|page=102}}</ref> The game was particularly well received in Germany, where it was known as ''Herzog 2''; ''[[:de:Power Play (Zeitschrift)|Power Play]]'' magazine gave it an 80% score in its April 1990 issue,<ref name="powerplay_herzog2"/> and ''[[:de:Play Time|Play Time]]'' gave it an 85% score in its June 1991 issue.<ref name="playtime_herzog">{{cite journal|title=Konsolen Spiel: Herzog Zwei|journal=[[:de:Play Time|Play Time]]| date=June 1991 |issue=1|pages=116–7|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ninretro.de%2Fgame-4-2397.html|access-date=3 March 2012}}</ref>

=== Retrospective coverage ===
Retrospective reviews have been very positive. David Filip of ''[[AllGame]]'' gave the game a score of 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as "one of the first" and "one of the best" [[strategy video game]]s on home consoles and as "a fine cure for those days when you want a different kind of RTS to control".<ref name="allgame_zwei"/> ''[[Game Informer]]'' in 1999 scored it 9.75 out of 10, making it the magazine's highest-rated Genesis game.<ref name="GI"/> Daniel Thomas of ''Sega-16'' gave it a score of 10 out of 10 in 2004, describing it as "very probably the finest video game you've never played" and as the Genesis console's "finest hour".<ref name="Sega-16"/> Lawrence Wright of ''Insomnia'' gave the game a score of 5 out of 5 stars in 2008.<ref name="insomnia_zwei"/> [[GameSpot]] users have given ''Herzog Zwei'' an average score of 8.8 out of 10 as of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title = Herzog Zwei for GEN|website = GameSpot|url = http://www.gamespot.com/genesis/strategy/herzogzwei/index.html|access-date = 2009-01-04}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
The game concept of a central command and fighting vehicle directing other friendly units to attack remote enemy base appeared in past games, such as Sir Tech's 1984 game ''[[Rescue Raiders]]''. However, Scott Sharkey of [[1UP.com]] states that the 1988 game ''[[Modem Wars]]'' was possibly "[t]he closest predecessor" to ''Herzog Zwei'', but that it "was fairly primitive and abstract by comparison", that earlier such games lacked the ability to construct units or manage resources which made them "much more [[Real-time tactics|tactical]] than strategic", and that the slower processors made the ticks "so long that the games were practically turn based".<ref name="1UP" /> ''[[Total Annihilation]]'' (1997) and its spiritual successor ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'' also inherit the concept of a large robotic command vehicle which is used to construct and command an army. Conversely, ''[[Total Annihilation]]'' and ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'' are controlled in a similar fashion to traditional [[real-time strategy]] games; unlike in ''Herzog Zwei'', the command vehicle in those games is mainly nothing more than a particularly powerful and versatile unit.
