'''''The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle''''' is a 1989 [[puzzle video game]] developed by [[Kemco]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In 1990, it was released with the same title for the [[Game Boy]] in North America and Europe. In Japan, it was released for the [[Family Computer Disk System|Disk System]] as {{nihongo foot|'''''Roger Rabbit'''''|ロジャーラビット|Rojā Rabitto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, and then for the Game Boy as {{nihongo foot|'''''Mickey Mouse'''''|ミッキーマウス|Mikkī Mausu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}. 

Each version of the game features different cartoon characters based on their respective titles: [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Roger Rabbit]], or [[Mickey Mouse]]. The object of the game is to go through a series of rooms collecting items to advance to higher levels while avoiding related cartoon characters.

It is the first puzzle game in Kemco's ''[[Crazy Castle (series)|Crazy Castle]]'' series and the only one that was released for a home console. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2]]'', in 1991.

==Gameplay==
While presented in a [[platform game|side-scroller format]], ''Crazy Castle'' differs from standard side-scrollers such as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' in that Bugs Bunny does not have the ability to jump; therefore, only by taking different routes can Bugs avoid enemies. Some of the levels have [[boxing glove]]s, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten thousand-pound weights that can be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game has a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove, and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects. Because most [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game cartridges lacked the ability to save, passwords can be used to start at a certain level in this game.

==Plot==
[[Honey Bunny]], who doesn't exist in any media outside of the game's ending screen, has been kidnapped by Wile E. Coyote, Yosemite Sam, Daffy Duck, and Sylvester. Bugs must travel through 60 levels (80 in the Game Boy version) in order to save her. To get past each level, Bugs must collect all 8 carrots in each level.

==Characters==
There are four minions - Sylvester, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and Yosemite Sam. However, the Sylvester character has three variations - two gray, one green and one pink, Daffy has two variations, one being dark gray and one brown, and Yosemite Sam being either in blue or brown.
* '''Gray Sylvester''' - can only travel up a floor or a tube; cannot bypass a door or tube without going through it; cannot go under staircases; cannot stop moving; two of this kind can be used in a single level.
* '''Green Sylvester''' - can travel both up and down a floor or tube; can bypass a door or tube without going through it; can go under staircases; cannot stop moving.
* '''Pink Sylvester''' - can only travel up a floor or a tube; cannot bypass a door or tube without going through it; cannot go under staircases; able to stop moving after a short distance travelled.
* '''Yosemite Sam / Wile E. Coyote''' - cannot go through doors or tubes; once they've traveled down a staircase, they cannot go back up; cannot stop moving.
* '''Daffy Duck''' - cannot go through doors or tubes; once he has traveled down a staircase, he cannot go back up; able to stop moving after a short distance travelled.

==Development==
The North American NES game is a modified version of the Japan-exclusive Family Computer Disk System title, ''Roger Rabbit''. Roger Rabbit is the game's playable character, all the villains are ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''-related, and hearts are collected. Due to [[Capcom]] owning the rights to develop and publish Disney film-based video games, as well as [[LJN]] already having published [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1989 video game)|own video game adaptation of the film]], Kemco decided to use Bugs Bunny, due to he and Roger both being rabbits, making it easier for Kemco to modify the ''Roger Rabbit'' game and release it outside Japan as ''The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle''. For the Game Boy version, Kemco's license to develop and/or publish video games based on ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' became outdated; however, they still had the license to create Disney-based video games, which they used to create ''Mickey Mouse'' for Game Boy. An early beta version of the game shows the working title as ''Bugs Bunny Fun House''. In 1997, Kemco released the Game Boy version along with ''[[The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2]]'' in one cartridge under the name ''Bugs Bunny Collection''.

==Sequels==
The game has spawned three sequels, including ''[[The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny: Crazy Castle 3]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny in Crazy Castle 4]]'' and a spin-off game, ''Woody Woodpecker in Crazy Castle 5''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Bugs-Bunny-In-Crazy-Castle-4-Passwords-GameBoy-Color-74894.shtml |title=Bugs Bunny in Crazy Castle 4 Passwords (GameBoy Color) - Softpedia |accessdate=2011-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018045832/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Bugs-Bunny-In-Crazy-Castle-4-Passwords-GameBoy-Color-74894.shtml |archivedate=2012-10-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://beta.gamespot.com/gba/action/woodywoodpeckercrazycastle5/index.html |title=New Games, Newest Games - GameSpot |accessdate=2011-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131113015943/http://beta.gamespot.com/gba/action/woodywoodpeckercrazycastle5/index.html |archivedate=2013-11-13 }}</ref>

The Game Boy Japanese version, '''Mickey Mouse''', has spawned four sequels, including [[The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2|Mickey Mouse II]], [[Kid Klown in Night Mayor World|Mickey Mouse III: Balloon Dreams]], [[The Real Ghostbusters (1993 video game)|Mickey Mouse IV: The Magical Labyrinth]], and [[Mickey Mouse: Magic Wands!|Mickey Mouse V: The Magical Stick]]. Other games published by Kemco with Mickey Mouse include the spin-off game [[Mickey's Dangerous Chase|Mickey's Chase]].

==Legacy==
The NES version of ''Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle'' was prominently featured in an ''[[Angry Video Game Nerd]]'' episode of the same name, which was released on August 5, 2009. It was featured again in the 2021 feature film, ''[[Space Jam: A New Legacy]]'' for a few brief moments, where a young [[LeBron James]] is given a Game Boy with the game inside it.<ref>{{Cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=2021-07-19|title=Space Jam 2's Game Boy cameo is fine, actually|url=https://www.polygon.com/22583573/space-jam-2-game-boy-bugs-bunny-game|access-date=2021-07-25|website=Polygon|language=en}}</ref>
