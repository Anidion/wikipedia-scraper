== Development and history ==
''Caper in the Castro'' was developed with the Mac [[HyperCard]] and the original game description file says that it was created over the course of 6 months.<ref name="internetarchive" /> C.M. Ralph has stated that they worked on it outside of their full-time job in Silicon Valley.<ref name="archive" /> In interviews, they have mentioned that they were inspired to create the game so they could give back to the LGBT community.
{{quote| text =In 1988 I had moved from Southern California (behind the orange curtain) to the San Francisco Bay Area. I was so impressed and grateful for the freedom of the LBGT community here as compared to what I had lived in down in SoCal. I wanted to give back to the community and also create a way to raise money for AIDS Charities.| sign =C.M. Ralph, Interview in ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''<ref name="paste">{{cite web |last1=Winkie |first1=Luke |title=A Q&A With The Designer of the First LGBT Computer Game |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/caper-in-the-castro-interview |publisher=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |access-date=23 February 2020 |date=9 June 2014 |archive-date=9 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609100056/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/06/caper-in-the-castro-interview.html |url-status=live  }}</ref>}}
Ralph made the game as [[charityware]] and asked for people to donate to an AIDS charity of their choice instead of paying for the game.<ref name="internetarchive">{{cite web |title=Caper in the Castro |date=January 1989 |url=https://archive.org/details/hypercard_caper-in-the-castro |publisher=Internet Archive |access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref> In this way, it was one of the only games in the 1980s and 1990s to directly reference [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name="cameraobscura">{{cite journal |last1=Ruberg |first1=Bonnie |title=Creating an Archive of LGBTQ Video Game Content: An Interview with Adrienne Shaw |journal=Camera Obscura |date=1 September 2017 |volume=32 |issue=2 (95) |page=170 |doi=10.1215/02705346-3925176}}</ref> The game was distributed freely over [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS), which allowed programs and information to be shared between computers using telephone lines. These systems provided a way for diverse communities to network easily. The game was specifically shared on the LGBT BBS.<ref name="cameraobscura" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Malloy |first1=Judy |title=Social media archeology and poetics |date=2016 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0262034654 |pages=20â€“21}}</ref>

In 1989, C.M. Ralph released an alternative version of the game called ''Murder on Mainstreet'' for commercial sale. This version swapped out the main characters' names and other details to exclude LGBT themes, so that they could sell it to a publisher that might not have been interested in an LGBT-related game.<ref name="archive" /><ref name="journalcomm" /> Heizer Software sold this version of the game in mail order catalogs.<ref name="archive" /><ref name="paste" />

From 2014 to 2017, the game was thought to be lost because there were no known [[floppy disk]] copies left, and since the game was distributed through BBS, it was unlikely any copies would have survived.<ref name="strongmuseum">{{cite web |last1=Borman |first1=Andrew |title=Game Saves: Preserving the First LGBTQ Electronic Game |url=https://www.museumofplay.org/blog/2018/09/game-saves-preserving-the-first-lgbtq-electronic-game |publisher=The Strong National Museum of Play |access-date=24 February 2020 |date=7 September 2018 |archive-date=24 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224021839/https://www.museumofplay.org/blog/2018/09/game-saves-preserving-the-first-lgbtq-electronic-game |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="paste" /> However, in 2017, C.M. Ralph found original floppy disks of both ''Caper in the Castro'' and ''Murder on Mainstreet'' while in the process of moving.<ref name="archive" /> [[Adrienne Shaw]], the director of the LGBTQ Video Game Archive, reached out to [[The Strong National Museum of Play]] to find a way to access the data on the floppy disks. From there, Andrew Borman, the Digital Games Curator at The Strong, came up with a solution to access the game.<ref name="strongmuseum" /> In 2017, playable versions of both ''Caper in the Castro'' and ''Murder on Mainstreet'' were hosted online through the Internet Archive.<ref name="internetarchive" /> In 2019, the game was exhibited at [[Schwules Museum]] in Berlin, during the Rainbow Arcade, the first exhibit on the history of LGBTQ video games.<ref name="theguardian" />
