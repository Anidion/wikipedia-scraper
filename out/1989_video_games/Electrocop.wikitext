== Development and release ==
[[File:Atari-Lynx-I-Handheld.jpg|thumb|right|''Electrocop'' began development prior to the existence of any functional Atari Lynx hardware.]]
''Electrocop'' was conceived by Greg Omi when he worked at Epyx as games developer and programmer alongside Chuck Sommerville. In an [[online interview]] with website ''The Atari Times'', Omi recounted about the development process of the game, stating that work on the project began before any functional Atari Lynx hardware existed and the team were working on an [[emulator]] of the console on the [[Amiga]] [[microcomputer]] at a slow [[frame rate]], in addition of also using a [[video camera]] to scan the image in order to test how the graphics would look like once the hardware was finalized, although an early revision of the Lynx capable of displaying [[raster graphics]] was made later during development.<ref name="GOECTttmbtC!"/><ref>{{cite web|last=D.

A long-running rumor was that ''Electrocop'' initially started as a 3D sequel to Dennis Caswell's ''[[Impossible Mission]]''. However, when asked about this rumor, Omi said "it's funny, but I can't remember if it was supposed to be a sequel to ''Impossible Mission'' or not. I remember writing a story and basic game design and pitching it to [[RJ Mical|RJ [Mical]]], but I don't remember if they were asking for a sequel."<ref name="RG122">{{cite magazine|last=Bevan|first=Mike|title=The History Of: Impossible Mission - The Electrocop Connection|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=122|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|date=December 2013|page=45}}</ref> Despite being a fan of ''Impossible Mission'' and knowing Caswell personally, Omi could not recall if he was still a member of Epyx.<ref name="RG122"/> Atari [[Video game music#Composers|composer]] Alex Rudis was also involved during the production of the project and created the music for it.<ref>{{cite web|last=D.

''Electrocop'' was one of the original launch titles during the initial release of the Lynx in 1989, along with the aforementioned ''Blue Lightning'', ''California Games'' and ''[[Gates of Zendocon]]''. It was also released in Europe around the same time period and later in Japan on December 23 of the same year, where it was distributed by Mumin Corporation instead and the difference between the international and Japanese releases is that the latter came bundled with an [[Video game packaging#Instruction manuals|instruction manual]] in Japanese.<ref name="GDRLynx"/><ref name="LLcfj"/><ref name="JSOSJS89">{{cite web|last=Covell|first=Chris|url=https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/OTH_1989Q3.html|title=Japanese Secrets! - Other Systems: Jul. - Sept. 1989 - Atari Lynx Announcement|website=chrismcovell.com|date=March 3, 2016|access-date=2019-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122091735/http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/OTH_1989Q3.html|archive-date=January 22, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The game was first showcased to the public during the [[Consumer Electronics Show#1980s|International Summer Consumer Electronics Show 1989]] along with the system, though early previews showed the title under the earlier name ''Net Runner''.<ref name="JSOSJS89"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-23/ACE_Issue_23_1989_Aug#page/n25/mode/2up|title=Hot From The USA - ACES From The Biggest Computer Show On Earth|magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]|issue=23|publisher=[[Ascential|EMAP]]|date=August 1989|pages=26–27|access-date=2019-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007232125/http://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-23/ACE_Issue_23_1989_Aug#page/n25/mode/2up|archive-date=2016-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jung reviewed the game which was published to IGN Entertainment. In his final verdict he wrote "This cart was a brilliant concept that didn't completely click; the race against the clock and the real-time exploration/combat elements are hampered with uninspired gameplay and little variety. Electrocop's stunning visuals and sounds make it fun to watch, but whether you'd buy a game for its razzle-dazzle is a personal decision." Giving a final score of 7 out of 10.<ref name="IGNec"/>
