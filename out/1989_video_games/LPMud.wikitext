LPMud
{{Short description|MUD server software}}
'''LPMud''', abbreviated '''LP''', is a family of [[multi-user dungeon]] (MUD) server software. Its first instance, the original LPMud game driver, was developed in 1989 by Lars Pensjö (the '''LP''' in LPMud).{{R|bartle-lars|shahromine-mudlib|pike}} LPMud was innovative in its separation of the MUD infrastructure into a [[virtual machine]] (termed the ''driver'') and a development framework written in the [[programming language]] LPC (termed the ''[[mudlib]]'').{{R|bartle-mudlib}}

==Development==
[[File:LoginScreen.jpg|thumb|right|The login screen from ''Genesis'' since May 2011]]

Lars Pensjö had been an avid player of [[TinyMUD]] and [[AberMUD]]. He had wanted to create a world with the flexibility of TinyMUD and the style of AberMUD{{R|bartle-lpmud}} but did not want to have sole responsibility for creating and maintaining the game world. He once said, "I didn't think I would be able to design a good adventure. By allowing [[Wizard (MUD)|wizards]] coding rights, I thought others could help me with this."{{R|dog}}  The result was the creation of a new, [[C (programming language)|C]]-based, [[object-oriented programming]] language, LPC, that made it simple for people with minimal programming skills to add elements like rooms, weapons, and monsters to a virtual world.{{R|giuliano}}

To accomplish his goal, [[Lennart Augustsson]] convinced Pensjö to write what today would be called a virtual machine, the LPMud driver. The driver managed the interpretation of LPC code as well as providing basic [[operating system]] services to the LPC code. By virtue of this design, Pensjö made it more difficult for common programming errors like [[infinite loop]]s and [[infinite recursion]] made by content builders to harm the overall stability of the server. His choice of an [[object-oriented programming|OO]] approach made it easy for new programmers to concentrate on the task of "building a room" rather than programming logic.{{R|pike}}

Pensjö created ''Genesis'' in April 1989 as the first implementation of the LPC language, and therefore the first LPMud, in which the developer (commonly known as a [[Wizard (MUD)|wizard]] within the MUD) could code their own objects.{{R|netgames1|dog|reese-genesis|bartle-genesis}}

Pensjö's work has been extended or reverse engineered in a number of projects:
* {{Anchor|Amylaar}}LPMud 3.2, better known as the Amylaar driver, after its lead developer, Jörn "Amylaar" Rennecke{{R|ywwr2|reese-amylaar}}
* [[MudOS]]{{R|ywwr2}}
* [[Dworkin's Game Driver|DGD, Dworkin's Game Driver]], a conceptual rather than code derivative of LPMud developed by [[Felix Croes|Felix "Dworkin" Croes]]{{R|shahromine-dgd}}
* [[SWLPC (programming language)|SWLPC]], [[Shattered World]]'s [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of LPMud 2.4.5{{R|reese-sw}}

Though an LPMud server can be used to implement nearly any style of game,{{R|hahn}} LPMuds are often thought of as having certain common characteristics as a genre, such as a mixture of [[hack and slash]] with [[role-playing game|role-playing]], [[Quest (gaming)|quests]] as an element of advancement, and "guilds" as an alternative to [[character class]]es.{{R|internetculture|ywwr1}}

==LPMud talkers==
LPMud was used as the basis for the first [[Internet]] [[talker]], ''[[Cat Chat]]'', which opened in 1990{{R|netlingo}}.

==TMI Mudlib==
The '''TMI Mudlib''' from [[The Mud Institute]]<ref name="Takacs">{{cite journal|last=Takacs|first=Mark|date=August 17, 1993|title=Prolix A Text-based Participant System for VR|location=Washington|page=13|quote=2.3.7 MIRE Kay has taken a TMI LPMud driver (a popular alternative driver developed by The Mud Institute) and used it as the basis for a multi-user news and information retrieval system |citeseerx = 10.1.1.53.5993}}</ref> was an attempt to create a framework driven [[mudlib]] for the [[MudOS]] LPMud driver. It consisted of many contributors to MudOS as well as people who became influential in the LPMud community. When TMI began work in 1992, a mudlib was generally packaged with both an LPMud driver and a complete world built on top of the mudlib. As a framework-driven mudlib, the goal of the TMI mudlib was to provide only examples for world objects and place the burden of building a working world on the game developers using TMI.

TMI implemented the first [[InterMUD]] communications network, when [[MudOS]] added network socket support in 1992.<ref name="dog"/>

In 1992, MIRE, a multi-user information system producing customised newspapers<ref>Electronic Publishing Group at the MIT Media Lab. [http://web.media.mit.edu/~walter/ep.html 25+ Years of the Electronic Publishing Group] "MIRE--news in a MUD"</ref> was built based on a modified TMI driver.<ref name="Takacs"/>

In 1993, the TMI-2 mudlib was used to create ''PangaeaMud'', an academic research project designed as an interactive geologic database tool.<ref>{{cite thesis

Notable MUDs based on TMI-derived mudlibs include ''[[The Two Towers (MUD)|The Two Towers]]''{{R|english}}{{R|smith-bebak}}{{R|jones}}{{R|ber}}{{R|Ekman-ttt}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mudconnect.com/mud-bin/adv_search.cgi?Mode=MUD&mud=The+Two+Towers |title=The MUD Connector: The Two Towers |publisher=[[The MUD Connector]] |quote=Highly customized TMI-2 1.1.1 mudlib on MudOS v22 (May 4, 2007) |access-date=2010-07-06 |archive-date=2012-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717014932/http://www.mudconnect.com/mud-bin/adv_search.cgi?Mode=MUD&mud=The+Two+Towers |url-status=dead }}</ref> set in [[Tolkien]]’s universe{{R|english}} and ''Threshold''.

== Server software ==
'''MudOS''' is a major family of LPMud server software, implementing its own variant of the LPC (programming language).<ref name="ywwr" /><ref name="busey-mudos" />  It first came into being on February 18, 1992.<ref name="reese-mudos" />  It pioneered important technical innovations in MUDs, including the network socket support that made [[InterMUD]] communications possible<ref name="dog" /><ref name="shahromine" /> and LPC-to-C compilation.<ref name="reese-beek" /> 

'''FluffOS''' started as a collection of patches of last unreleased version of MudOS, FluffOS has evolved into an independent and enhanced project, providing a powerful platform for crafting interactive and immersive virtual worlds, it is the best choice of running LPMUD lib now, as well as creating new ones. For more information, you can visit the main website at FluffOS Official Website at.<ref name="fluffos" />

''[[Genocide (MUD)|Genocide]]'' was an important development testbed for MudOS from 1992 to 1994, but switched back to the main LPMud branch, citing speed concerns.<ref name="reese-geno-mudos" /><ref name="reese-geno-lpmud" />

About a year later Fredrik Hübinette started playing one of these games and found that the language was the most easy-to-use language he had ever encountered.

''"Having fun playing ''TinyMUD'' and ''AberMUD'', Lars Penjske decides to write a server to combine the extensibility of ''TinyMUD'' with the adventures of ''AberMUD''.  Out of this inspiration, he designed ''LPC'' as a special MUD language to make extending the game simple.  Lars says, '...I didn't think I would be able to design a good adventure.  By allowing wizards coding rights, I thought others could help me with this.'  The first running code was developed in a week on Unix System V using IPC, not BSD sockets.  Early object-oriented features only existed accidentally by way of the nature of MUDs manipulating objects.  As Lars learned C++, he gradually extended those features.  The result is that the whole LPMud was developed from a small prototype, gradually extended with features."'' —'''George Reese's''' ''LPMud Timeline''

 | quote = È stato creato nel 1990 da Lars Pensjö presso la Chalmers Academic Computing Society in Svezia.  Pensjö proveniva dall'esperienza dell'AberMUD e il suo sistema è sostanzialmente il frutto di un compromesso tra la rigidità di AberMUD e l'egualitarismo del TinyMUD.  Il server LPMUD è diverso dagli altri perché non è un gioco prefabricato ma un linguaggio, chiamato LPC, che gli utenti possono utilizzare per interagire, modificare il loro ambiente e costruire un gioco.  Un DikuMUD è molto più efficiente come programma ma non può essere modificato senza avere un alto livello di conoscenza nella programmatazione.  Invece un LPMUD è molto più flessible ed è possibile costruire anche oggetti molto complessi con un livello di conoscenza inferiore.  Grazie a questa flessibilita, che si adatta all'immaginazione dei giocatori, LPMUD si è diffuso rapidamente.  Il livello di programmazione degli oggetti però non è esteso a tutti, ma è limitato ai giocatori che hanno raggiunto un livello elevato di competenza all'interno del MUD stesso e delle sue regole.  Grazie a questo maggior controllo del mondo, un LPMUD tende ad essere più organico e coerente nella construzione del mondo, diversamente dal TinyMUD che tende invece a diventare un po' caotico. '''Translation''': It was created in 1990 by Lars Pensjö of the Chalmers Academic Computing Society in Sweden.  Pensjö's experience was with AberMUD, and its system is basically the result of a compromise between the rigidity of AberMUD and the egalitarianism of TinyMUD.  The LPMUD server is different from others because it is not a game but a prefabricated language called LPC, which users can use to interact, change their environment and build a game.  A DikuMUD is much more efficient as a program but cannot be changed without having a high level of programming knowledge.  On the other hand, LPMUD is much more flexible, and you can build very complex objects with a lower level of knowledge.  Thanks to this flexibility, which adapts to players' imagination, LPMUD has spread rapidly.  The level of programming objects is not for everyone, but is limited to players who have reached a high level of competence within the MUD itself and with its rules.  Thanks to this greater control of the world, a LPMUD tends toward more comprehensive and coherent construction of the world, unlike TinyMUD, which tends to get a little chaotic.}}</ref>

It is normally against the rules for seasoned characters to help you with your quests or finding a guild, but some LPmuds do not enforce this.
