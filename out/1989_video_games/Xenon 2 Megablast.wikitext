'''''Xenon 2: Megablast''''' is a 1989 [[shoot 'em up]] video game developed by [[The Bitmap Brothers]] and published by [[Image Works]] for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]]. It was later converted to the [[Master System]], [[PC-98]], [[X68000]], [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]], [[Commodore CDTV]], [[Game Boy]], [[Acorn Archimedes]] and [[Atari Jaguar]] platforms. The game is a sequel to ''[[Xenon (video game)|Xenon]]'' and takes place a millennium after the previous title. The goal of the game is to destroy a series of bombs planted throughout history by the Xenites, the vengeful antagonists of the first game.

''Xenon 2: Megablast'' is the third major video game release by The Bitmap Brothers. Its subtitle is derived from the [[Bomb the Bass]] track "[[Into the Dragon|Megablast (Hip Hop on Precinct 13)]]", which serves as the game's theme music. The original release of ''Xenon 2: Megablast'' was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, with reviewers praising the detailed visuals, addictive gameplay, variety of weapons and innovative soundtrack.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Xenon II Megablast in-game screenshot (Atari ST).png|thumb|left|An example of gameplay in the Atari ST version of ''Xenon 2: Megablast''.]]
''Xenon 2: Megablast'' is a vertically scrolling [[shoot 'em up]]<ref name="Manual">''Xenon 2: Megablast'' instruction manual</ref>{{rp|5}} in which the player takes on the role of a [[starship]] pilot who must destroy five bombs planted throughout history by the villainous Xenites.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|3}} The player controls the Megablaster, a small battlecraft that can move in multiple directions, is equipped with a [[raygun]] as an offensive measure, and is shielded from enemy attacks and collisions for a temporary period.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|5}} The game is split into five scrolling levels ranging in theme from the [[Cambrian]] era to futuristic metallic spaceways. The levels are primarily inhabited by aggressive lifeforms that have been mutated by radiation emanating from the bombs planted at the end of each level.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|6}}

Attacks from these enemy characters will decrease the player's shield. If the shield is completely depleted, the ship will be destroyed by the next hit it sustains, and the player will lose a [[Life (gaming)|life]].<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|5}} Each level contains six "restart positions", from which the ship will respawn at the most recent position passed if a life is lost.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|9}} If all three lives are lost, the game [[Game over|ends prematurely]].<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|5}} The shield can also sustain damage if the ship is trapped in a corner of the scenery and is crushed as the screen continues to scroll. The player can reverse the direction of the scrolling to a limited extent by pulling back on their directional input when the ship is at the bottom of the screen. A [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] character is found at the end of each level and requires a specific strategy to destroy. When the boss is defeated, the bomb within the level will defuse. The first level only features one boss character, while the other four feature another boss at the level's halfway point.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|7}}

Capsules can occasionally be found within the levels, and release one of a variety of collectible tokens when destroyed.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|8}} These tokens can augment the ship's weaponry or speed, restore a portion of the ship's shield, or allow the ship to dive into the background for a limited time.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|10–12}} Destroyed enemies leave behind currency known as Real Cash, the quantity and value of which depending on the size of the enemy. Real Cash can be used to buy and sell tokens at "Crispin's Swop Shop", which the player can access twice per level.<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|8}} ''Xenon 2: Megablast'' is primarily single-player, but allows for two players to [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|play intermittently]].<ref name="Manual"/>{{rp|4–5}}

==Development and release==
''Xenon 2: Megablast'' was conceptualized and designed by [[The Bitmap Brothers]] (consisting of Mike Montgomery, Steve Kelly and Eric Matthews) and published by [[Image Works]].<ref name="OpeningCredAmiST">''Xenon 2: Megablast'' (Amiga, Atari ST) opening credits</ref> It is the third major release by The Bitmap Brothers after ''[[Xenon (video game)|Xenon]]'' and ''[[Speedball (video game)|Speedball]]''.<ref name="STFRev">{{cite magazine |title=''Xenon 2'' |last=Barrett |first=Gary |magazine=[[ST Format]] |date=October 1989 |pages=82–83}}</ref> Matthews reckoned that "everyone seems to be into destruction and extra weapons in a big way", and sought to satisfy this demand with ''Xenon 2: Megablast''. The development team drew inspiration from ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'', ''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]'' and ''[[R-Type]]'', and attempted to deviate from the shoot 'em up formula by making the enemy characters less predictable and predetermined. The Megablaster's ability from the previous title to transform into a tank was omitted to make the gameplay more straightforward.<ref name="WorkInProgress">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-08/page/n23/mode/2up |title=Work in Progress: ''Xenon II'' |last=Penn |first=Gary |magazine=[[The One (magazine)|The One]] |date=May 1989 |pages=25–28}}</ref>

[[File:Xenon_2_Megablast_Amiga_Theme.ogg|thumb|right|The title's namesake, "[[Into the Dragon|Megablast (Hip Hop on Precinct 13)]]" by [[Bomb the Bass]], was arranged by [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]] and incorporated as the game's primary musical theme.]]
The game was programmed by [[The Assembly Line]], who wrote the code on an [[IBM Personal Computer]] and then ported to an [[Atari ST]].<ref name="STFRev"/> The graphics were created by Mark Coleman,<ref name="OpeningCredAmiST"/> who designed the visuals based on Matthews's brief descriptions using both [[DEGAS (software)|DEGAS Elite]] and additional animation routines written by Montgomery.<ref name="STFRev" /><ref name="WorkInProgress"/> The audio was created by [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]],<ref name="OpeningCredAmiST"/> who arranged the [[Bomb the Bass]] track "[[Into the Dragon|Megablast (Hip Hop on Precinct 13)]]" as the game's background score.<ref name="ACERev">{{cite magazine |url=http://amr.abime.net/review_14038 |title=Screentest: ''Xenon II'' |last=Connor |first=Pete |magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]] |date=October 1989 |pages=50–51}}</ref> The game's subtitle is derived from this track.

It's instrumental, which makes it relatively easy to reproduce on computer, and the title says it all." [[Rhythm King]] founder Martin Heath and Bomb the Bass headman Tim Simenon were both avid fans of computer games, and their favourable response resulted in "Megablast" being licensed for the game.<ref name="WorkInProgress"/>

An early version of ''Xenon 2: Megablast'' was demonstrated on the [[Channel 4]] programme ''Signals'' in mid-January 1989, and the game was formally announced in April.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-07/page/n9/mode/2up |title=News: Bros – The Hot News |magazine=[[The One (magazine)|The One]] |date=April 1989 |page=10}}</ref> After an additional showing at a promotions event by [[Mirrorsoft]] in [[Amsterdam]], ''Xenon 2: Megablast'' was released in September 1989.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://amr.abime.net/review_33015 |title=Previews: Mirrorsoft Into the '90s |magazine=[[ST/Amiga Format]] |date=June 1989 |page=96}}</ref> On that month, a promotional [[sweepstake]] was run by ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' and Mirrorsoft in which contestants who filled and mailed a postcard were eligible to win the grand prize of a [[Discman]] and a copy of the Bomb the Bass album ''[[Into the Dragon]]'', from which the game's titular track originates.

The Amiga and Atari ST versions of ''Xenon 2: Megablast'' were met with critical acclaim. Roland Waddilove of ''[[Atari ST User]]'' gave the game a perfect score and declared it to be one of the year's best vertically-scrolling shoot 'em ups, but stated that while the gameplay is "fast and addictive", it lacked originality in the face of a saturated shoot 'em up market.<ref name="AtariSTUserRev">{{cite magazine|last=Waddilove|first=Roland|date=October 1989|title=Blast it!|magazine=[[Atari ST User]]|pages=36–37}}</ref> Stuart Wynne of ''[[Zzap!64]]'' lauded the game's difficulty, and said that while the gameplay was standard for its genre, the wide range of power-ups to enhance the ship with served as a vital difference.<ref name="Z64Rev">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-054/ZZap_64_Issue_054_1989_Oct#page/n69/mode/2up |title=Zzap!

MacDonald noted that the "add-on weapons" system was "awesome", and both he and McCandless felt that the "restart position" system kept the learning curve and difficulty at a reasonable level.<ref name="ZeroRev"/>

Brian Nesbitt of ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' commended the game's variety of weapons, and felt that the game "will undoubtedly have the same effect on the games scene as its predecessor did over a year ago".<ref name="TheOneRev">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/theone-magazine-11/TheOne_11_Aug_1989#page/n40/mode/1up |title=''Xenon II: Megablast'' |last=Nesbitt |first=Brian |magazine=[[The One (magazine)|The One]] |date=August 1989 |pages=41–44}}</ref> Pete Connor of ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' decided that the game "is one of the most accomplished shoot-em-ups you're likely to come across this side of Christmas", and that the challenge provided by the amount of detail and action balanced out the low amount of levels.<ref name="ACERev"/> Gary Barrett of ''[[ST Format]]'' called the game "extremely addictive and exciting" in spite of its lack of new concepts, and considered it to be "in the same elite class as ''[[Blood Money (video game)|Blood Money]]''".<ref name="STFRev"/> Tony Horgan of ''[[Amiga User International]]'' was grateful for the feature of retaining weapons after losing a life, which he felt made the game's balance "perfect".<ref name="AUIRev">{{cite magazine|last=Horgan|first=Tony|date=November 1989|title=Review: ''Xenon II: Megablast''|magazine=[[Amiga User International]]|pages=90–91}}</ref> Mike Pattenden of ''[[Commodore User]]'' observed that "''Xenon II'' pursues the relentless quest for an arcade quality shoot'em up on the Amiga, and it's probably the closest yet."

The Sega versions were assessed positively by ''[[Mean Machines]]''. Julian Rignall and Richard Leadbetter both praised the Master System version's graphics as some of the best on the console, and considered the gameplay to be as addictive as its 16-bit counterparts due to the variety of weapons, though Leadbetter felt that the pace of the gameplay was slow and that the sound effects were lacking.<ref name="MeanMachinesMSRev"/> Rignall and Leadbetter also complimented the visuals of the Mega Drive version, but were disappointed by the jerky scrolling and poor musical arrangement.<ref name="MeanMachinesMegaDriveRev"/> Damien Noonan of ''[[Amiga Format]]'' rated the [[Commodore CDTV]] version a paltry 32%, commenting that, while innovative at the time it was first released, the game had aged poorly and its gameplay was not well-balanced.<ref name="CDTV"/> In a middling review of the Game Boy version, ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' spoke positively of the mechanic of buying weapons to upgrade the ship and the challenge provided by the enemies approaching from all sides, but criticized the slow speed of the ship and the absence of continuous firing.<ref name="NPRev">{{cite magazine |title=Now Playing: ''Xenon 2'' |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |date=January 1993 |pages=106–107}}</ref>
