'''''Friday the 13th''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Atlus]] and published by [[LJN]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Based on the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|horror franchise of the same name]], players control counselors at [[Camp Crystal Lake]] as they attempt to defeat [[Jason Voorhees]]. The game received generally negative reviews, with criticism centered on its high difficulty and poor gameplay.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Friday the 13th gameplay.png|left|thumb|185px|Gameplay of ''Friday the 13th'']]
Players control one of six camp counselors (each with varying levels of speed, rowing, and jumping ability) in a [[side-scrolling]] perspective. The counselors start with an arcing rock attack. The goal is to find and defeat [[Jason Voorhees]] three times. Along the paths, players will find cabins, a lake, caves, and wooded areas with all but the cabins having enemies such as zombies, crows, and wolves attacking the player. Players may upgrade their weapons upon finding a new one. A timed alarm appears at certain intervals, requiring players to find Jason before he kills one or more children or another counselor. Using the map, players must navigate their way to Jason's location or switch to the counselor being attacked and defeat him. If they do not make it there in time, Jason will kill the counselors or some of the children.<ref name=manual>{{cite book | title=Friday the 13th | type=instruction booklet| publisher=[[LJN Toys Ltd.]] |date=February 1989 | id=NES-F3-USA }}</ref>
 	
Upon nearing Jason's location, Jason may appear on the path or in the lake and attack the player. When inside a cabin Jason will attack the player in a way reminiscent of the video game ''[[Punch-Out!! (NES)|Punch-Out!!]]''.<ref name="gamepro"/> Players may light the fireplaces inside of larger cabins. Upon lighting all fireplaces, a flashlight and torch weapon are available. Notes are found in some larger cabins leading the player to other notes in other locations, eventually leading to new items. The objective of the game is to survive for three days and three nights while attempting to find and kill Jason. Players may battle [[Pamela Voorhees|Jason's mother]] who is in a hidden locked room in the cave. She is represented as a [[Medusa]]-like floating head that swoops down to attack the player.  Navigating in the woods or cave can be confusing as they are set up to purposely disorient the player. They hide several locked rooms/cabins. If all counselors or children die, the game is over.<ref name=manual />

==Characters==
The player can choose from six camp counselors at the start of the game. The currently played counselor can be changed after stepping into a small cabin, which allows for quick traversal across the map in times that a counselor or the children are being attacked. It is also possible to trade items with unplayed counselors by moving to their location. Each counselor has strengths and weaknesses in speed and they could make the difference in surviving or dying during the course of the game:
*Chrissy is the strongest female character, with fast running speed, fast weapon throwing speed, and a high jump, but her rowing speed is slow.
*Debbie is the weakest female character, with fast weapon throwing and average rowing speed, but slow running speed and low jump height.
*George is the weakest male character, possessing slow running speed, low jump and average weapon throwing speed, but with a fast rowing speed
*Laura has fast movement speed, fast weapon throwing speed, but with a low jump and average rowing speed.
*Mark is the strongest male character, with fast running speed, a high jump and fast rowing speed, but with a slow weapon throwing speed.
*Paul has a slow running speed and a low jump, but fast rowing speed and fast weapon throwing speed

===Legacy=== 
In June 2013, the [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] released an exclusive figurine of the video game-style Jason with the turquoise and purple [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] to go along with their other Nintendo-esque horror figure, a video game-style [[Freddy Krueger]] based on LJN's ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (video game)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://necaonline.com/41508/licenses/movies/friday-the-13th/sdcc-exclusive-video-game-jason-voorhees-action-figure-coming-to-comic-con/|title=SDCC Exclusive: Video Game Jason Voorhees Action Figure Coming to Comic-Con!|publisher=Neca Online|date=June 6, 2013|access-date=September 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3247606/toys-as-promised-heres-necas-8-bit-freddy-krueger-based-on-the-1989-nes-game/|title=NECA's 8-Bit Freddy Krueger Based On the 1989 NES Game!!!|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|date=August 7, 2013|access-date=September 28, 2013}}</ref>

In 2017, after developer [[IllFonic]] released ''[[Friday the 13th: The Game]]'', a "Retro Jason" skin based on Jason from the 1989 game was added by developers in a [[software update|video game patch]] to apologize to fans for issues the game experienced when initially released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/friday-the-13th-developers-say-sorry-with-a-new-update-and-free-stuff-for-everyone/|title=Friday the 13th developers say 'sorry' with a new update and free stuff for everyone|publisher=PC Gamer|date=June 19, 2017|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref>
