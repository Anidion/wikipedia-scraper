'''''Dragon Knight''''' (ドラゴンナイト) is a [[fantasy]]-themed [[eroge]] [[role-playing video game]] and the original entry in the [[Dragon Knight (video game series)|''Dragon Knight'']] franchise that was originally developed and published by [[ELF Corporation]] in 1989. Its remake was created by [[NEC Avenue]] in 1995. Both versions were released only in Japan. The game was adapted into an anime film in 1991 and was followed by ''[[Dragon Knight II]]'' in 1990.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Dragon Knight gameplay.gif|thumb|left|Exploration in the 1995 remake.]]
Gameplay-wise, ''Dragon Knight'' is a [[dungeon crawler]] typical for its era (similar to that of early ''[[Wizardry]]'' games). The exploration and combat are shown from the [[First-person narrative|first-person perspective]] using a 2D engine, combat in the game is turn-based and enemies are encountered randomly (a similar system was also used in the [[Dragon Knight II|first sequel]]). With each new floor, the mazes becomes more sophisticated (in the remake there is a helpful [[mini-map]] with grid coordinates), and enemies are getting stronger. The fights in the first game are difficult and unbalanced. The protagonist can attack, defend, and use spells and items to fight monsters (up to six (three in the remake) at once).

==Plot==
In the kingdom of Strawberry Fields (ストロベリーフィールズ), a place inhabited only by women, the Goddess' Tower has protected the land and its people for generations. Then one day, the monstrous Dragon Knights, corrupted by evil and led by the demon Gazelbaan (ゲイゼルバーン), descended upon the tower, and the people of Strawberry Fields suddenly find themselves threatened by his army of monsters, who have turned the goddess Aquarina (アクァーリナー) to stone and captured the warrior women, demanding the six gems that are a source of magical power of the goddess to be delivered to them or else they would kill their hostages. Answering the plea for help from village girl Luna (ルナ) (voiced by [[Noriko Hidaka]]), the young warrior and traveler Yamato Takeru (ヤマト・タケル) (voiced by [[Akira Kamiya]]) takes them on. Luna's mother is voiced by [[Rei Sakuma]]. On each floor of the Tower there are captured females for Takeru to rescue from rapists.

==Release==
The game was originally released in 1989 for the [[PC88]], [[PC98]] and [[MSX]], followed by the [[Sharp X68000]] version in 1990. The 1995 remake ''Dragon Knight & Graffiti'' for the [[PC Engine]] was developed and released by [[NEC Avenue]].

Two [[soundtrack]]s: ''Dragon Knight: Treasure King of Water Chapter'' (ドラゴンナイト～水の宝王篇～) and ''PC Engine World—Dragon Knight & Graffiti'' were released in Japan by [[Datam Polystar]] in 1990 and by NEC Avenue (distributed by [[Nippon Columbia]]) in 1995, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vgmdb.net/album/799 |title=PSCX-1013 &#124; Dragon Knight - Treasure King of Water Chapter |publisher=VGMdb |date= |accessdate=2013-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://vgmdb.net/album/808 |title=NACL-1180 &#124; PC Engine World — Dragon Knight & Graffiti |publisher=VGMdb |date= |accessdate=2013-12-17}}</ref> An [[OVA]] anime adaptation was released by Polystar on the [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc|LD]] in 1991.
