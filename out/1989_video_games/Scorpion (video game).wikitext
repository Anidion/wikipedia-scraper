screams quality and style, except for the box illustration which is a little iffy. The game is a zany ''[[Gryzor]]'' cum ''[[Green Beret (video game)|Green Beret]]'' hybrid with deliriously large, fast characters and plenty of bit noises."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/amiga-computing-magazine-013/AmigaComputing_013_Jun_1989#page/n76/mode/1up/ |title=Amiga Computing Magazine Issue 013 |date=June 1989 |access-date=2015-05-22}}</ref> ''Computer and Video Games'' called it "a competently executed game, let down by some easily corrected errors, and suffer[ing] from not enough outside criticism before release."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-and-videogames-091/ComputerAndVideoGames_091_May_1989#page/n35/mode/1up/ |title=Computer and Videogames Magazine Issue 091 |date=May 1989 |access-date=2015-05-22}}</ref>
