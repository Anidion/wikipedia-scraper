'''''DuckTales'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Wanpaku Dakku Yume Bōken'''''|わんぱくダック夢冒険||lit. ''Naughty Ducks Dream Adventures''}}, the Japanese title of the TV series}} is a [[platform game]] developed and published by [[Capcom]] and based on the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated [[DuckTales|TV series of the same name]]. It was first released in North America for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1989 and was later ported to the [[Game Boy]] in 1990. The story involves [[Scrooge McDuck]] traveling around the globe collecting treasure and outwitting his rival [[Flintheart Glomgold]] to become the world's richest duck.

Produced by key personnel from the ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]]'' series, ''DuckTales'' sold over a million copies worldwide on each system, becoming Capcom's best-selling title for both platforms. The game was praised for its tight control, unique and non-linear gameplay and bright presentation, and is often regarded as one of the best titles for the NES, appearing on numerous "Best of" lists.

''DuckTales'' was followed by a sequel, ''[[DuckTales 2]]'', in 1993. A [[Remaster (video game)|remastered]] version of ''DuckTales'' developed by [[WayForward|WayForward Technologies]], featuring high resolution graphics and performances by the surviving members of the show's voice cast, named ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]'', was released in 2013 for [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Wii U]]. The original 8-bit version of the game was also included in ''[[The Disney Afternoon Collection]]'' compilation for PC, [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/six-classic-disney-games-coming-to-ps4-xbox-one-an/1100-6448744/ | title = Six Classic Disney Games Coming To PS4, Xbox One, And PC In New Compilation Pack | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = March 15, 2017 | access-date = March 15, 2017 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-date = April 30, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170430131645/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/six-classic-disney-games-coming-to-ps4-xbox-one-an/1100-6448744/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:NES Duck Tales.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of Scrooge in the African Mines level]]

Players control [[Scrooge McDuck]] as he travels around the world and outer space in search of five treasures to further increase his fortune. Scrooge is able to attack enemies and get around using his cane. On the ground, Scrooge can swing his cane to attack enemies and to break open or throw certain objects. While jumping, Scrooge can bounce on his cane similarly to a [[pogo stick]] and attack enemies from above. This also allows him to reach higher areas as well as bounce across hazardous areas that hurt his palmate. Along the way, Scrooge can find various diamonds, hidden inside treasure chests or appearing in certain areas, to increase his fortune and ice cream that can restore his health. Scrooge will also encounter various [[List of DuckTales characters|characters from the series]] who have a variety of roles, such as providing hints, offering useful items, opening access to new areas, or attempting to stop Scrooge's progress. Hidden in the game is a secret life-restoring cheat, accessed by pressing the select button while standing still, that will refill Scrooge's [[Health (game terminology)|heart points]] for $3,000,000.<ref name="DKOldies" />{{better source|date=February 2023}}

The game features five [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s: [[Africa]]n mines, [[Amazon rainforest|The Amazon]], [[Himalayas|The Himalayas]], [[Transylvania]], and [[Moon|the Moon]]. The player can visit any of the destinations to pursue the treasures in any order. However, The African mines and Transylvania must be revisited to acquire certain essential items. Two secret treasures are scattered between all five destinations. Each destination's treasure is protected by a boss that Scrooge must defeat to retrieve. When all five main treasures are collected, the player returns to Transylvania for a final boss fight against Dracula Duck. After defeating him, the player must contend with [[Flintheart Glomgold]] and [[Magica DeSpell]] for the final treasure.

Upon completing the game, players can receive one of three endings based on their performance:<ref name="DKOldies">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dkoldies.com/blog/did-you-know-nes-duck-tales-had-3-endings/|title=Did you Know NES Duck Tales Had 3 Endings?|last=Collier|first=Steven|date=2016-02-16|website=DKOldies: Retro Game Store|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24|archive-date=January 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114205451/https://www.dkoldies.com/blog/did-you-know-nes-duck-tales-had-3-endings/|url-status=live}}</ref>{{better source|date=February 2023}} a regular ending for simply clearing the game, a great ending for clearing the game with at least $10,000,000, and a bad ending for clearing the game with $0.<ref name="DKOldies" />{{better source|date=February 2023}} As the player is given $1,000,000 for each level's treasure, the bad ending is only achievable by spending all accumulated money on the life-restore cheat before the player ends the game.<ref name="DKOldies" />{{better source|date=February 2023}} In order to do that, the player has to collect exactly $1,000,000 to get a total money of $6,000,000 because one gets a total of $5,000,000 from the bosses. Then, the player has to apply the life-restore cheat two times to end up with $0.<ref name="DKOldies" />{{better source|date=February 2023}}

==Development==
Although Capcom had previously worked with Disney by publishing the [[Hudson Soft|Hudson]]-produced ''[[Mickey Mousecapade]]'' in North America in 1988, ''DuckTales'' became the first licensed game that the company developed,<ref name="Hardcore101">{{cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/disneynes/disneynes2.htm |title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Disney Capcom NES Games |author=Ayala, Michael |access-date=March 31, 2013 |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |archive-date=July 16, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716165156/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/disneynes/disneynes2.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> and shared many key personnel with the original ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]]'' series including producer [[Tokuro Fujiwara]], character designer [[Keiji Inafune]], and sound programmer Yoshihiro Sakaguchi.

Revisions to the game included the removal of crosses from the coffins in the Transylvania stage, replacing them with the letters "[[Rest in peace|RIP]]", replacing hamburgers as power-ups with ice cream, and the omission of an option for Scrooge to give his money up, an action deemed too "un-Scrooge-like".<ref name=Darlene_Waddington_interview>{{cite web |title=Darlene Waddington reveals all! |url=http://rpgd.emulationworld.com/ballz/ducktales/production.htm |access-date=March 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113074604/http://rpgd.emulationworld.com/ballz/ducktales/production.htm |archive-date=January 13, 2006}}</ref> Scrooge McDuck's shirt sprite was changed from blue to red to make him stand out and pop more against the blue and dark backgrounds.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tieryas|first=Peter|date=February 2, 2021|title=The Story Behind DuckTales On NES|url=https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-ducktales-on-nes-1846174912|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202184752/https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-ducktales-on-nes-1846174912 |archive-date=February 2, 2021 |access-date=2021-02-03|website=Kotaku|language=en-us}}</ref> A leaked prototype cartridge from a private collector reveals several differences between the original, unfinished version and the final release, such as different level names, unused music for the Transylvania stage, slower tempo on the music for the Moon stage, unused or altered text, and the character [[Gizmoduck]] going by his Japanese name "RoboDuck".<ref name="Hardcore101" /><ref name="Proto">{{cite web |title=Duck Tales, woo woo! |url=http://rpgd.emulationworld.com/ballz/ducktales/index.htm |access-date=March 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231121401/http://rpgd.emulationworld.com/ballz/ducktales/index.htm |archive-date=December 31, 2005}}</ref> Despite the changes, images of the unfinished [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta version]] could be seen in the 1990 books ''Consumer Guide: Hot Tips for the Coolest Nintendo Games'' and the ''NES Game Atlas'' by Nintendo.

''DuckTales'' was later ported to the [[Game Boy]] in late 1990. This version features the same gameplay, music and levels of the original console release, though the layout of each level was changed to accommodate the handheld's lower resolution screen.<ref name="Hardcore101" />

''DuckTales'' was a commercial success, with the NES and Game Boy versions selling approximately 1.67 million and 1.43 million copies worldwide respectively, each becoming Capcom's highest-selling titles for their respective platforms.<ref name="Sales">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/sfii-snes-is-capcoms-best-selling-game |date=May 27, 2008 |title=SFII SNES is Capcom's best-selling game |website=[[Eurogamer]] |author=Bramwell, Tom |access-date=March 23, 2013 |archive-date=March 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329151721/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/sfii-snes-is-capcoms-best-selling-game |url-status=live }}</ref> It was released to generally positive reviews, with ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' praising the NES version for its gameplay and colorful graphics, calling it "a prime example of very good game design".<ref name="EGM" /> The magazine additionally commented that the title was probably made "with younger players in mind" due to its short length and relative lack of difficulty or complexity, declaring that "you'll probably enjoy this game but find it beaten after the first day of play".<ref name="EGM" /> Conversely, ''Mean Machines'' magazine called the game "very tough and challenging", elaborating that "it requires plenty of skill to get all the way through the game in one go".<ref name="Mean Machines" /> ''Nintendo Power'' later called the Game Boy port "a faithful translation from the NES version".<ref name="NP" />
