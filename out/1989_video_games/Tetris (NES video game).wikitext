'''''Tetris''''', also known as '''classic ''Tetris''''', is a [[puzzle video game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) released in 1989, based on ''[[Tetris]]'' (1985) by [[Alexey Pajitnov]]. It was published after a legal battle between Nintendo and Atari Games, who had [[Tetris (Atari Games)|already released a ''Tetris'' NES port]] under a license that was found to be invalid. [[Bullet-Proof Software]] had previously published [[List of Tetris variants|''Tetris'' for the Family Computer]] in December 1988,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bps.co.jp/04_products/index31.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000823075808/http://www.bps.co.jp/04_products/index31.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 23, 2000|title=Products: Family Computer|publisher=Bullet-Proof Software}}</ref> while Nintendo had published [[Tetris (Game Boy video game)|''Tetris'' for the Game Boy]] earlier in 1989.

This ''Tetris'' port is unusual because the game is designed to end by becoming too fast to play, after a certain number of [[Tetris#Gameplay|lines are cleared]]. Score must be accumulated through efficient play, rather than pure endurance, before the game ends. These circumstances have lead to its use as an [[esports]] game. Although the highest game speed was intended to be unplayably difficult, it was shown to be manageable with novel controller grips developed in the 2020s.

==Gameplay==
{{see also|Tetris#Gameplay}}
This version of ''Tetris'' has two modes of play: A-Type and B-Type. In A-Type play, the goal is to achieve the highest score. As lines are cleared, the level advances and increases the speed of the falling blocks. In B-Type play, the board starts with randomized obstacle blocks at the bottom of the field, and the goal is to clear 25 lines. The level remains constant, and players choose the height of the obstacle beforehand.<ref name="manual">{{cite book |title=Tetris Instruction Booklet |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |location=USA |year=1989 |url=https://www.gamesdatabase.org/media/system/nintendo_nes/manual/formated/tetris_-_1988_-_tengen_ltd..pdf |access-date=October 3, 2021 }}</ref>

[[File:Tetris NES play.png|thumb|left|A-Type game]]
During play, the [[Tetris#Game pieces|tetrominoes]] are chosen randomly. This leaves the possibility of extended periods with no long bar pieces, which are essential because [[Tetris#Scoring|Tetrises]] are worth more than clearing the equivalent amount of lines in singles, doubles, or triples. The next piece to fall is shown in a preview window next to the playfield. In a side panel, the game tracks how many of each tetromino has appeared in the game so far.<ref name="manual"/>

In A-Type, the level advances for every 10 lines cleared. Each successive level increases the points scored by line clears and changes the colors of the game pieces.<ref name="manual"/> All levels from 1 to 10 increase the game speed. After level 10, the game speed only increases on levels 13, 16, 19, and 29,{{efn|name=PAL killscreen|This is only the case on the [[NTSC]] version of the game. On [[PAL]] the last speed change happens at level 19, which is that version's "kill screen".}} at which point the speed no longer increases. On level 29, pieces fall at 1 grid cell every frame, which is too fast for almost all players, and it is thus called the "[[kill screen]]".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Trew |first=James |date=May 6, 2022 |title=How Gen Z is pushing NES Tetris to its limits |url=https://www.engadget.com/teens-tetris-and-rolling-130002013.html |access-date=2023-04-19 |website=[[Engadget]] |language=en-US}}</ref> The developers of the game never intended anyone to play past the kill screen, as the game does not properly display the level numbers past 29,<ref name="good">{{Cite web |last=Good |first=Owen S. |date=2019-04-13 |title=Elite Tetris player takes the NES version where no one has gone before |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/13/18309474/tetris-kill-screen-level-33-record-joseph-saelee |access-date=2023-04-19 |website=Polygon |language=en-US}}</ref> but with modern [[#Speed techniques|speed techniques]], skilled players can play past level 29.<ref name="sweet">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-revolution-in-classic-tetris |title=The Revolution in Classic Tetris |last=Sweet |first=Jacob |date=March 26, 2021 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |access-date=October 3, 2021}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

When starting a game, players can select a starting level from 0 to 9, but if the A button is held on the controller when selecting a level, 10 additional levels are added, raising the starting options to 0 to 19.<ref name="manual" /> When starting on a later level, the level is not supposed to advance until as many lines have been cleared as it would have taken to advance from level 0 to the starting level.<ref name="manual" /> Due to a bug, the levels will begin advancing earlier than intended when starting on level 10 or higher.<ref name="meatfighter" />

At the end of an A-Type game, a substantial score yields an animated ending of a rocket launch in front of [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]]. The size of the rocket depends on the score, ranging from a [[bottle rocket]] to the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'' spaceplane]]. In the best ending, a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] appears on the launch pad and the cathedral lifts off.<ref name="meatfighter">{{cite web |url=https://meatfighter.com/nintendotetrisai |title=Applying Artificial Intelligence to Nintendo Tetris |last=Birken |first=Mike |date=January 28, 2014 |access-date=October 3, 2021}}</ref> After a high-level B-Type game, various Nintendo characters perform in front of the cathedral.<ref name="meatfighter"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oldschoolgamermagazine.com/mario-mania-game-cameos-for-the-fans-complete-collection-tetris-for-nes/ |title=Mario Mania: Game Cameos for the Fan's Complete Collection – Tetris for NES |last=Oxford |first=David |date=July 4, 2019 |work=Old School Gamer Magazine |access-date=October 3, 2021}}</ref> 

The definition of "beating the game" has changed over time with the development of novel controller methods designed for high-level play. After clearing around 1550 lines, the game is at risk of crashing due to inefficient multiplication operations.<ref name="meatfighter"/> Crashing the game in this way is popularly considered "beating the game", a feat first achieved on 21 December 2023 by 13-year-old [[Willis Gibson]], known by his online alias "Blue Scuti".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/twitch-youtube-blue-scuti-tetris-kill-screen-nes-1851134043 |title=Three Decades Later, Someone Has Finally Beaten ''Tetris'' On NES |last=Winslow |first=Levi |date=January 2, 2024 |work=Kotaku |access-date=January 2, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popsci.com/technology/tetris-beat-kill-screen/ |title=A 13-year-old wunderkind is the first human to 'beat' Tetris |last=Paul |first=Andrew |date=January 2, 2024 |work=Popular Science |access-date=January 2, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67871775 |title= Tetris: US teenager claims to be first to beat video game |agency= [[BBC News]] |date= 3 January 2024 |access-date= 3 January 2024 |last= Ferreira Santos |first= Sofia}}</ref> 

===Scoring===
The score received by each line clear is dependent on the level. Each type of clear, being a single, double, triple, or Tetris, has a base value which is multiplied by the number 1 higher than the current level. For any level <math>n</math>, a single will give <math>40(n+1) </math> points, a double will give <math>100(n+1)</math> points, a triple will give <math>300(n+1)</math> points, and a Tetris will give <math>1200(n+1)</math> points.<ref name="manual" /> The game also awards points for holding the down key to make pieces fall faster, awarding 1 point for every grid cell that a piece is continuously soft dropped.<ref name="manual" /> Unlike line clears, this does not scale by level.

This scoring convention makes scoring Tetrises much more efficient than scoring an equivalent amount of lines through smaller line clears. At level 0, a Tetris awards 300 points per line cleared, a triple awards 100 points per line cleared, a double awards 50 points per line cleared, and a single awards 40 points per line cleared. For example, a single in level 0 is worth 40 points and a Tetris worth 1,200 points. A single in level 9 is worth 400 points and a Tetris worth 12,000 points, and a single in level 29 is worth 1,200 points (same as a Tetris on level 0) and a Tetris on level 29 is worth 36,000 points.

==High-level play==
===Speed techniques===
[[File:Rolling grip.jpg|thumb|Inputs can be made rapidly by flicking the game controller from behind ("rolling") with as many successive fingers as needed to move the falling game piece to the desired location.]]
One of the most limiting factors in NES ''Tetris'' is the speed at which a tetromino can be moved left and right. On the NTSC version, when a movement key is pressed, the piece will instantly move one grid cell, stop for 16 frames due to delayed auto-shift, before moving again once every 6 frames, or 10 times per second.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 30, 2018 |title=What is DAS and Hyper Tapping in Tetris |url=https://simon.lc/what-is-das-and-hyper-tapping-in-tetris |access-date=2023-04-19 |website=Simon Laroche |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://meatfighter.com/nintendotetrisai/#The_Mechanics_of_Nintendo_Tetris |title=The Mechanics of Nintendo Tetris |access-date=June 14, 2024}}</ref> At higher levels, waiting for this delay is not feasible because the pieces fall too fast.

{{anchor|Hypertapping}}A technique known as "hypertapping" is used to circumvent this delay. When hypertapping, horizontal tetromino speed is maximized by rapidly tapping the [[D-pad]] more than 10 times per second.<ref name="kotaku">{{cite web |last=Gach |first=Ethan |date=October 22, 2018 |title=16-Year-Old Dethrones ''Tetris'' World Champion With Difficult Hyper-Tap Technique |url=https://kotaku.com/16-year-old-dethrones-tetris-world-champion-with-diffic-1829911215 |access-date=October 4, 2021 |work=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref> The technique involves flexing the [[bicep]] until it [[tremor]]s, so that the high-speed tremor taps the thumb on the D-pad.<ref name="sweet" /> [[Thor Aackerlund]] was the first hypertapper,<ref name="sweet" /> but the technique was very rare until it was popularized by Joseph Saelee in 2018.<ref name="karnadi">{{Cite web |last1=Karnadi |first1=Chris |title=Teens are rewriting what is possible in the world of competitive Tetris |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=2022-07-21 |url=https://www.polygon.com/23269073/competitive-classic-tetris-ctwc-jonas-neubauer-andy-michael-artiaga |language=en-US |access-date=2022-08-01 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Jacob Sweet of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' described hypertapping as "turning [the] thumb into a [[jackhammer]]."<ref name="sweet" />

===History of major achievements===
In 2009, Harry Hong became the first independently verified person to achieve 999,999 points on an unmodified cartridge, known as a maxout score.<ref name="sweet" /> Earlier plausible but unverified max-out scores were claimed by [[Thor Aackerlund]] {{circa|1990}} and [[Jonas Neubauer]] {{circa|2002}}.<ref name="sweet"/>

[[File:NES Tetris falling speed by level.jpg|thumb|In the North American release, level&nbsp;29 is associated with an extreme increase in piece gravity.{{efn|name=PAL killscreen}}]]
The game pieces reach their maximum falling speed on level 29 on the NTSC version and 19 on the PAL version,<ref name=":0"/> when the speed suddenly doubles.<ref name="sweet"/> According to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', level 29 "seems intentionally impossible—a quick way for developers to end the game."<ref name="sweet"/> Because of this "soft wall", efficient play was required to accumulate points before level 29 ended the game.<ref name=":0"/> In the 2000s, level 29 came to be known as the game's "[[kill screen]]"<ref name="sweet"/>{{snd}}though this label was found to be a misnomer when the level was passed in the 2010s.<ref name="good"/>

==== Progression beyond level 29 ====
Aackerlund, a hypertapper, first demonstrated that level 29 could be beaten in 2011; he is shown reaching level 30 in the documentary film ''[[Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters]]''.<ref name="sweet" /> From level 30, the game's level counter stops working correctly, further suggesting that the developers did not believe level 29 could be surpassed.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="good" /><ref name="sharma">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSloQyl8HBs |title=13-year-old Becomes First Human to Beat Tetris: All You Need to Know |date=January 4, 2024 |last=Sharma |first=Palki |publisher=[[Firstpost]] |via=[[YouTube]] |work=Vantage with Palki Sharma |accessdate=January 4, 2024}}</ref> Level 31 was first reached in 2018 by 15-year-old hypertapper Joseph Saelee who eventually cleared four more consecutive levels until level 35,<ref name="neumann">{{cite web |last=Neumann |first=Sean | website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] | date=October 19, 2018 | url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/5988gb/this-bartender-is-secretly-the-greatest-tetris-player-in-the-world | title=This Bartender Is Secretly the Greatest Tetris Player in the World |accessdate = January 4, 2024}}</ref> and by 2020 hypertappers had gone as far as level 38.<ref name="orland">{{cite web |last=Orland |first=Kyle |date=January 2, 2024 |title=34 years later, a 13-year-old hits the NES Tetris 'kill screen' |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/someone-has-finally-beaten-nes-tetris/ |accessdate=January 4, 2024 |website=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref> Kyle Orland of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' explains that because of the rolling technique introduced by Martinez in 2020, "players were getting good enough to effectively play indefinitely on the same 'Level 29' speed that had been considered an effective kill screen just a few years earlier."<ref name="orland" /> By 2022, the highest level reached was 95.<ref name="karnadi" />

The final matchup in the Classic Tetris World Championship in 2022 resulted in competitors Eric Tolt and [[Justin Yu]] both reaching two million points in a game and levels 73 and 69, respectively. To prevent extremely prolonged games, the CTWC has modified their competition cartridges in 2023 to include a "super killscreen" at level 39, where pieces reach the bottom of the well in only a sixth of a second - two blocks per frame.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiAb8sqrtDc |title=The Greatest Classic Tetris Game of All Time Just Happened |date=May 20, 2023 |language=en |time=1:57 |access-date=2024-01-16 |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref name="ctwc" />{{third-party inline|date=April 2024}}

In 2014, computer researcher Mike Birken published an analysis of ''Tetris''<nowiki/>'s game code, including details on [[Undocumented feature|unexpected behaviors]] that occur at very high levels.<ref name="meatfighter" /> 

An [[Integer overflow|integer overflow bug]] is first encountered at level 138, where [[Palette (computing)|color palettes]] would be loaded from unrelated areas of memory, creating unusual and unintended game piece colors. In particular, levels 146 and 148, nicknamed "dusk" and "charcoal" by players, feature black game pieces that are extremely [[Contrast (vision)|difficult to see]] against the black background, hindering further progression. Additionally, the score-counting code could [[Crash (computing)|crash]] the game after about 1550 lines are cleared, corresponding to level 155.<ref name="meatfighter" />

By 1989, about six companies claimed rights to create and distribute the ''Tetris'' software for home computers, game consoles, and handheld systems.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=From Russia with Litigation|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26|date=February 1997|page=42}}</ref> [[Elektronorgtechnica|ELORG]], the Soviet bureau that held the ultimate copyright, claimed that none of the companies were legally entitled to produce an [[Arcade game|arcade]] version, and signed those rights over to [[Atari Games]]. Non-Japanese console and handheld rights were signed over to [[Nintendo]].

''Tetris'' was shown at the January 1988 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in Las Vegas, where it was picked up by Dutch-born American games publisher [[Henk Rogers]], then based in Japan. This eventually led to an agreement brokered with Nintendo where ''Tetris'' became a [[launch game]] for [[Game Boy]] and bundled with every system.<ref name=guardian020609>{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Bobbie | website=[[The Guardian]] | date=June 2, 2009 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/jun/02/tetris-25anniversary-alexey-pajitnov | title=How Tetris conquered the world, block by block}}</ref>

===Implementation===
Pajitnov is credited for the "original concept, design and program"<ref name="manual"/> but was not directly involved in developing this version.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Rebecca | website=[[NBC News]] | date=January 5, 2024 | url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tetris-creator-surprises-willis-gibson-teen-beat-game-rcna132387 | title=Teen who beat Tetris gets a surprise meeting with game's creator |access-date=January 7, 2024}}</ref>

The NES does not have hardware support for generating random numbers.<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://pcgworkshop.com/papers/2022/pcg2022_full_paper_4435__Entropy_Lost_Nintendos_Not_So_Random_Sequence_Of_32767_Bits.pdf |title=Entropy Lost: Nintendo's Not-So-Random Sequence of 32,767 Bits |last1=Ngo |first1=Trang |author-link1= |last2=Williams |first2=Aaron |author-link2= |date=September 2022 |publisher=FDG '22: Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games |book-title= |at=Article 65, pp. 1-10 |location= |conference= |id=}}</ref> A [[Pseudorandomness|pseudo-random number generator]] was implemented with a 16-bit [[linear-feedback shift register]]. The algorithm produces a close, but slightly uneven distribution of the seven types of game pieces; for every 224 pieces, there is one fewer long bar piece than would be expected from an even distribution.<ref name="meatfighter"/>

The game's code includes an unfinished and inaccessible two-player versus mode, which sends rows of garbage blocks (with one opening) to the bottom of the opponent's board when lines are cleared. This feature may have been scrapped due to a rushed development schedule, or to promote sales of the [[Game Link Cable]] which enables a two-player mode in Nintendo's [[Tetris (Game Boy video game)|Game Boy ''Tetris'']].<ref name="meatfighter"/>

===Music===
The soundtrack was written by Nintendo composer [[Hirokazu Tanaka]], who also scored the Game Boy version.<ref name=guardian020609/> Focusing on [[Music of Russia#18th and 19th century: Russian classical music|Russian classical music]],<ref name="sheff"/> the soundtrack features arrangements of "The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' and the overture from [[Georges Bizet]]'s opera ''[[Carmen]]''. The former replaces the arrangement of "[[Korobeiniki]]",<ref name="meatfighter"/> present in the Game Boy version, which has become strongly associated with ''Tetris''.<ref name=guardian020609/>

Michael Suck of ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' considered the game a success, praising the adjustable starting level and music. Suck considered the graphics to be adequate, noting that they do not overwhelm the senses.<ref name="asm"/>

The events that lead to Nintendo acquiring the license to publish a ''Tetris'' game for consoles are explained in BBC's TV documentary ''[[Tetris: From Russia with Love]]'' (2004), as well as a dramatic retelling in ''[[Tetris (film)|Tetris]]'' (2023).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pingitore |first=Silvia |date=2023-03-19 |title=Interview with Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov |url=https://the-shortlisted.co.uk/alexey-pajitnov-tetris-interview/ |access-date=2023-07-04 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Since 2018, Nintendo's ''Tetris'' has experienced a resurgence in popularity with a younger audience. In 2020, more people attained a [[#Competition|max-out score]] than from 1990 to 2019 combined.<ref name="sweet"/>

In 2018, 11 classic ''Tetris'' experts were instructed to play with the next piece preview window disabled ("no next box"). Their average score was found to drop dramatically, from 465,371 in control games to 6,457 with no next box. The author notes that even though one participant went on to become that year's world champion, no player was recorded scoring a Tetris{{efn|Scoring a ''tetris'' refers to the act of clearing four lines at once with a long bar piece.}} during any of the no next box games.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berry |first1=Jacquelyn|date=June 2023 |title=No Next Box, No Experts: A Special Case of Epistemic Behavior in Extreme Tetris Expertise |url=https://www.journalofexpertise.org/articles/volume6_issue2/JoE_6_2_Berry.pdf |journal=Journal of Expertise |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=164–175}}</ref>

The recordings suggested that novice players [[Blinking|blink]] less than usual while playing ''Tetris'', whereas experienced players remained closer to their normal blinking rate.
