'''''Lords of the Rising Sun''''' is a 1989 video game by [[Cinemaware]], game design and art by Doug Barnett, released for the [[Amiga]] among other systems. Like the earlier ''[[Defender of the Crown]]'', it was a mix of map-based strategy and arcade-style mini games as the player, playing as one of the famous Japanese generals [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune|Yoshitsune]] or [[Minamoto no Yoritomo|Yoritomo]], fights to pacify [[Japan]] by force. In the short documentary "The Total War Story", Mike Simpson, studio director for the company Creative Assembly said that the company's ''Total War'' series of games had been influenced by ''Lords of the Rising Sun''.
