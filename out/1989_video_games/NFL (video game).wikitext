This game was the first since ''[[NFL Football (video game)|NFL Football]]'' - released in 1979 for the [[Intellivision]] - to get an official [[National Football League]] license. Intending to loosely represent the [[1988 NFL season|1988-89 season of the National Football League]], the game uses the teams and play formations of that particular era while avoiding usage of the players' names, due to a lack of an [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] license, which was given to [[Tecmo]]'s [[Tecmo Bowl]].<ref name="mobygames"/><ref name="ign">{{cite web | url = http://cheats.ign.com/objects/007/007133.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040224075109/http://cheats.ign.com/objects/007/007133.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = February 24, 2004 | title = Game overview (second reference) | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = | accessdate = 2011-10-14}}</ref>

The player could play one of four options, either Interconference, [[American Football Conference|AFC]] and [[National Football Conference|NFC]] game or the [[Super Bowl]] (specifically [[Super Bowl XXIII]]). Along with the option to choose a package to play during the game, players can directly control the entire team at once. This game was one of the first NFL video games on a gaming system.<ref name="mobygames">{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/nfl | title = Game overview | publisher = [[MobyGames]] | date = | accessdate = 2011-01-19}}</ref> The game employs a [[Video_game_graphics#Top-down_perspective|Top-Down]] system for the actual [[gameplay]] and allows players to assign handicaps to a human opponent that is not as skilled as they are.

==Reception==
[[Allgame]] gave the game a 2.5 out of 5 rating in their overview.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14115 | title = Rating information for ''NFL Football'' | publisher = [[allgame]] | date = | accessdate = 2012-10-25}}</ref>
