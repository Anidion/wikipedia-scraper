'''''Gates of Zendocon''''' is a [[scrolling shooter|horizontally scrolling shooter]] developed by [[Epyx]] and published by [[Atari Corporation]] in 1989 in North America and Europe for the [[Atari Lynx]]. It was released in Japan on December 23 of the same year, where it was distributed by Mumin Corporation.<ref name="GDRLynx">{{cite web|url=http://tk-nz.game.coocan.jp/gamedatabase/software/DB_ATM_LX1989-1991.html|title=LYNX Soft > 1989-1991|website=GAME Data Room|access-date=2019-04-07|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408074001/http://tk-nz.game.coocan.jp/gamedatabase/software/DB_ATM_LX1989-1991.html|archive-date=2018-04-08|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="LLcfj">{{cite web|last=Philippe|first=Jean|url=http://jeanphilippe.garin.perso.neuf.fr/reportage%20Japan.html|title=La console lynx au Japon - La LYNX ce fait japonaise|website=pageperso.aol.fr|date=2002|access-date=2019-05-05|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827234411/http://jeanphilippe.garin.perso.neuf.fr/reportage%20Japan.html|archive-date=2016-08-27|url-status=live}}</ref> One of the first games written for the [[Video game#Platforms|platform]], it was one of the [[launch title]]s that were released along with the system in North America.

In the game, the eponymous evil spider has trapped the player's space fighter in his web of universes, which are interconnected by a series of teleportation gates and riddled with alien bases, with the primary objective of finding and defeating him while recruiting friendly allies along the way. Programmed by ''[[Todd's Adventures in Slime World]]'' author Peter Engelbrite, ''Gates of Zendocon'' began its development prior to the existence of functional Lynx hardware.

''Gates of Zendocon'' received positive reception from critics after its initial release, with praise towards the presentation, originality and gameplay but the sound department received criticism. An updated conversion for the [[Atari Jaguar]] was planned but never went into full production due to a lack of internal interest.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:LYNX Gates of Zendocon.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot]]

''Gates of Zendocon'' is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up game where the player take control of an unnamed space fighter craft across 51 non-linear levels ("universes"), with the main objective being finding and defeating the evil spider Zendocon by passing through teleportation gates to do so, while battling against an assortment of Zendocon's army.<ref name="GOZmanual">''Gates of Zendocon'' game manual (Atari Lynx, US)</ref><ref name="GOZhg101">{{cite web|last=Barbato|first=Steven|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/xexex/|title=Gates of Zendocon|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=July 10, 2020|access-date=2020-07-12}}</ref> During gameplay, there are a number of friendly alien allies who were slaved by Zendocon that aid the player in their journey and protect the ship. Most of the levels are riddled with enemies and if the player's ship is hit by an enemy or projectile, it will reflect the amount of damage taken as a result: it can lose the laser tip and the engine before the last hit that will obliterate the player's ship. In addition, there is a hidden level inside the game where the player can earn high scores by destroying the faces of the game's creators.<ref name="EGMgoz">{{cite magazine|last=Kosher|first=Mike|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_11/page/n35|title=Tricks of the Trade - Secret Tricks, Codes, And Strategies - Gates of Zendocon - Secret Designers Room|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=11|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=June 1990|page=35}}</ref><ref name="IGNgoz"/>

== Development ==
[[File:Atari-Lynx-I-Handheld.jpg|thumb|right|''Gates of Zendocon'' started its development before any Atari Lynx hardware existed.]]

''Gates of Zendocon'' was written by Peter Engelbrite when he worked at Epyx as games developer and programmer. He also worked on [[Atari 2600]] conversion of other titles from the company such as ''[[California Games]]'', ''[[Summer Games (video game)|Summer Games]]'' and ''[[Winter Games]]''.<ref name="TGoPECpgt">{{cite web|last=D.

Later during development, an early revision of the Lynx capable of displaying [[raster graphics]] was made, with the game running for the first time on actual hardware, albeit at a slow [[frame rate]].<ref name="TGoPECpgt"/><ref name="RG129goz">{{cite magazine|last=Hawken|first=Kieren|title=Lynx Awakening: An Atari Lynx Retrospective|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=129|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|date=May 2014|pages=48–55}}</ref> Atari [[Video game music#Composers|composer]] Alex Rudis was also involved during the production of the project, recalling the process of the developer's pictures in the hidden level on another interview with ''The Atari Times'', which involved using a [[video camera]] to scan the image with [[Dave Needle]] and other team members freezing the images in order to be clear, while Rudis rotated his portrait as the scanning occurred to make it look distorted.<ref>{{cite web|last=D.

==Release==
''Gates of Zendocon'' was one of the launch titles during the initial release of the Lynx in 1989 along with  ''California Games'', ''[[Blue Lightning (1989 video game)|Blue Lightning]]'', and ''[[Electrocop]]''. It was also released in Europe around the same time period and later in Japan on December 23 of the same year, where it was distributed by Mumin Corporation instead and the difference between the international and Japanese releases is that the latter came bundled with an [[Video game packaging#Instruction manuals|instruction manual]] in Japanese.<ref name="GDRLynx"/><ref name="LLcfj"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Covell|first=Chris|url=https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/OTH_1989Q3.html|title=Japanese Secrets! - Other Systems: Jul. - Sept. 1989 - Atari Lynx Announcement|website=chrismcovell.com|date=March 3, 2016|access-date=2019-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122091735/http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/OTH_1989Q3.html|archive-date=January 22, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The game was first showcased to the public during the [[Consumer Electronics Show#1980s|International Summer Consumer Electronics Show 1989]], along with the system.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-23/ACE_Issue_23_1989_Aug#page/n25/mode/2up|title=Hot From The USA - ACES From The Biggest Computer Show On Earth|magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]|issue=23|publisher=[[Ascential|EMAP]]|date=August 1989|pages=26–27|access-date=2019-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007232125/http://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-23/ACE_Issue_23_1989_Aug#page/n25/mode/2up|archive-date=2016-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Rignall|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Rignall|url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-093b/page/n7|title=Review - Atari's Unbelievable Advantage|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=93|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=August 1989|pages=8–9}}</ref>
