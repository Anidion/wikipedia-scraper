'''''Rick Dangerous''''' is a [[platform game]] developed by [[Core Design]] for the [[Acorn Archimedes]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[MS-DOS]]. The game was released in 1989 and published by [[MicroProse]] on the [[Firebird Software]] label in the UK, and on the MicroPlay label in America. It was also published in Spain by Erbe Software. Later, it was released with two other games, ''[[Stunt Car Racer]]'' and ''[[MicroProse Soccer]]'', on the Commodore 64 ''Powerplay 64'' cartridge. The game was followed by a sequel, ''[[Rick Dangerous 2]]'', in 1990. Loosely based on the [[Indiana Jones]] film franchise, the game received [[Review|mixed reviews]] from critics.

== Plot ==
The plot of ''Rick Dangerous'' is largely based on the [[Indiana Jones]] film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. Set in 1945, British agent Rick Dangerous travels to the [[Amazon jungle]] to search for the lost Goolu tribe. His plane crashes in the jungle, and Rick must escape from the enraged Goolu. When the game starts Rick finds himself in a cave running from a rolling boulder, a famous scene from the Indiana Jones film.

Armed with a pistol and dynamite, Rick must fight hostiles and evade traps in three more levels. The second level of the game is set inside a [[pyramid]] located in [[Egypt]]. In the third level, Rick must venture to the [[Axis powers|Nazi]] stronghold of Schwarzendumpf castle to rescue captured [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers. The rescued soldiers tell him that the Nazis are planning a missile attack on [[London]]. Therefore, in the last level, Rick must infiltrate their secret missile base.

== Gameplay ==
Rick can jump and climb, as well as carry a limited amount of dynamite and ammunition for his gun. This gun is Rick's primary means of disposing of enemies. Most traps throughout the game that can kill Rick can also kill his enemies, which can be to the player's advantage. The dynamite sticks that Rick carries are generally used for solving puzzles, such as through exploding certain blocks (some of them fly ''towards'' the explosion, potentially killing Rick in the backfire). Rick is also armed with a pogo stick that allows him to paralyze enemies.

Many of the traps in ''Rick Dangerous'' have no visible warning, which means that a player's initial progress through the game may consist of trial and error. This was criticized by some reviewers.
