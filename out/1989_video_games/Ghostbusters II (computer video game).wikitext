'''''Ghostbusters II''''' is a 1989 [[action game]] based on the [[Ghostbusters II|film of the same name]]. It was published by [[Activision]] for various computer platforms. British studio Foursfield developed a version for [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]], which also got ported to the [[MSX]] by New Frontier. It features three levels based on scenes from the film. [[Dynamix]] developed a separate version for the DOS, also based on the film. The non-DOS versions were praised for the graphics and audio, but criticized for long loading times, [[disk swapping]], and the final level. The DOS, Commodore 64 and Amiga versions were the only versions released in North America.

==Gameplay==
''Ghostbusters II'' follows the plot of the film, in which the spirit of [[Vigo the Carpathian]] intends to enter the Earth world and take it over, by inhabiting the body of Oscar Barrett, the baby son of [[Dana Barrett]]. The player controls the [[List of Ghostbusters characters#Ghostbusters (1984)|Ghostbusters team]] as they try to stop Vigo.<ref name=CGW/><ref name=CVG/><ref name=TGM/>

The [[DOS]] version of the game begins with the Ghostbusters battling the ghosts of the Scoleri brothers in a courtroom, as in the film. Subsequently, the player can choose to do various activities, which include hunting for ghosts to earn money. Three ghost-plagued locations can be played: [[Central Park]], Northrones Department Store, and the Docks. In each location, the player blasts ghosts until they become trapped. The player must avoid slimeballs and fireballs thrown by the ghosts. The player can also collect slime samples from an abandoned underground train tunnel, but must avoid [[Slimer]] ghosts in the process. The collected slime is then tested with the use of a CD player. The slime is placed in a [[Beaker (laboratory equipment)|beaker]] and the player selects a song from the CD player; nine songs are available to choose from, and the player must select three calming songs to stabilize the slime. If the player chooses incorrectly, the slime explodes out of the beaker and the player must return to the train station to retrieve more slime. If the player loses a ghostbusting job or the slime challenge, then the player's Ghostbuster is sent to the Parkview mental ward. As one of the other Ghostbusters, the player can choose to rescue the institutionalized character from the ward. The player must earn $55,000 to take control of the [[Statue of Liberty]], which is used to reach an art museum, where the Ghostbusters battle Vigo.<ref name=CGW/>

The other computer versions – [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[MSX]] – feature three distinct levels based on scenes from the film.<ref name=ACE/><ref name=AA/><ref name=CVG/><ref name=TGM/><ref name=ZapAmiga/> In the first level, [[Ray Stantz]] is lowered into a subway tunnel to collect slime, while using three different weapons to deter various spirits.<ref name=AA/><ref name=CVG/> The player swings back and forth while descending the tunnel to collect the slime.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=CF/> The player has a courage meter which depletes if ghosts attack the player character, thereby scaring him. A life is lost if the meter is drained completely.<ref name=AF/><ref name=CU/><ref name=YS/><ref name=Zero/> The second level is a [[side-scrolling]] [[shoot 'em up]] in which the Statue of Liberty walks along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York. The player uses the statue's lit torch to shoot fireballs at oncoming ghosts, turning them into slime. The player also controls pedestrians who retrieve the slime in order to keep the torch lit.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=CF/><ref name=CU/><ref name=YS/><ref name=Zero/> The third level is viewed from an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric view]], and begins with the Ghostbusters trying to safely slide down a rope to land inside the art museum. The player then alternates between the four Ghostbusters as they rescue Oscar and defeat Vigo.<ref name=AF/><ref name=CVG/><ref name=CF/><ref name=TGM/><ref name=Zero/>

David Wilson of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' wrote a mixed review of the DOS version. Wilson praised the graphics, the Statue of Liberty level, and the digitized voice tracks, and called the game "well-designed and easily learned." However, Wilson wrote, "Since the game can be played in less than an hour and players will probably play the game, at least, fifteen times before mastering it, some may feel that this is less than a bargain."<ref name=CGW>{{cite magazine |last=Wilson |first=David |title=I Still Ain't 'Fraid of No Ghost! |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_67/page/n21 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January 1990 |access-date=April 23, 2019 |pages=22, 37 | issue=67}}</ref>

Paul Glancey of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' considered it superior to the film and praised the gameplay, stating that the levels made good use of the film's action sequences.<ref name=CVG/> ''[[Amstrad Action]]'' also considered it better than the film, and wrote that the "good graphics immediately set this game apart" from typical film-license games, stating, "It captures a cartoonesque quality that manages to convey the comic aspects of the movie excellently."<ref name=AA/> ''[[The Games Machine]]'' stated that the game "is quite addictive and succeeds in capturing the atmosphere of the film."<ref name=TGM/>

''[[Commodore Format]]'' praised the gameplay,<ref name=CF/> while Mark Mainwood of ''[[Commodore User]]'' praised the game as a good film [[tie-in]] and stated that it would appeal to almost anyone.<ref name=CU/> Andy Smith of ''[[Amiga Format]]'' called the game a "good translation of the film and a worthy successor" to the original ''[[Ghostbusters (1984 video game)|Ghostbusters]]'' video game (1984).<ref name=AF/> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' also considered it a good adaptation of the film.<ref name=SU/> Brian Nesbitt of ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' wrote that the game "fails to succeed both as a film conversion and as a game in its own right."<ref name=ACE/> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' criticized the gameplay as repetitive and stated that the levels feel too distinct from each other with "no real feeling of progression".<ref name=YS/> Mark Higham of ''[[ST Format]]'' considered the gameplay tedious and worse than the original ''Ghostbusters'' game.<ref name=STF/>

In 1991, ''[[Amiga Power]]'' called the game a "disgrace" and wrote, "Almost everything you could possibly do in ''Ghostbusters II'' called for a disk swap - even getting killed on the very first level - and the playing-time-to-time-spent-buggering-around-with-disks ratio was so completely ridiculous that some people thought they'd been sold a demo version by mistake."<ref>{{cite web |title=Oh dear... |url=https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Power_Issue_02_1991-06_Future_Publishing_GB/page/n11 |access-date=April 23, 2019 |work=Amiga Power |date=June 1991 |page=12}}</ref> The following year, ''Amiga Power''{{'}}s Stuart Campbell reviewed the re-release and criticized the gameplay as "lame and uninspired".<ref name=AP/> ''[[Games-X]]'' also reviewed the re-release and called the game a "fairly impressive film conversion".<ref name=Budget/>
