'''''Tecmo World Wrestling''''', released in Japan under the name {{nihongo|'''''Gekitou Pro Wrestling!! Toukon Densetsu'''''|激闘プロレス!! 闘魂伝説|Fierce Fighting Wrestling!! Legend of Fighting Spirit}}, is a two-player [[professional wrestling]] [[video game]] released in 1989 in Japan by [[Tecmo]] for the [[Family Computer]], and also in 1990 in North America and Europe for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The player can control one of ten fictional international [[professional wrestlers]]. This is the first wrestling game to feature a [[play-by-play]] announcer, the animated Tom Talker, although his speech was only text bubbles. The game's text, e.g. Tom Talker's commentary, was translated from the Japanese game almost directly, leading to instances of [[Engrish]]. For example, the [[Suplex#Northern Lights suplex|Northern Lights Suplex]] is called "Northern Right Suplex".
 
==Gameplay==
''Tecmo World Wrestling'' contains more than 20 moves per wrestler, by virtue of not having a dedicated grapple button. Instead, a grapple is initiated whenever the wrestlers walk into each other, and from there, combinations of the joypad and buttons can be used to perform a variety of holds and slams. There are also many situational moves (such as ground attacks, high-risk top-rope aerial attacks, and running attacks) to perform.

In addition, the game was perhaps the first to feature action replays: when certain signature moves are performed on a weakened wrestler, the game introduces a quick [[cut-scene]], showing the move being performed, as if in a close-up television replay.

Matches can be won by a standard three-count pinfall, submission, or by count-out (if a wrestler is tossed out of the ring, a twenty count starts, and if either wrestler is still outside of the ring when the count ends, they're disqualified).  In the single-player game, if both wrestlers are counted out, it counts as a loss for the player.

The single-player mode consists of defeating all of the other wrestlers in the game with your chosen wrestler.  Between matches, the player is given an option to train; through ''button mashing'' exercises, the player performs either [[squat (exercise)|squats]], [[sit-up (exercise)|situps]], or [[push-up]]s (with a [[sumo]] wrestler on his back).  When the meter measuring their progress in training fills up, a sphere above the meter (seven in total) fills up. The more training they do, the more damage their moves will do during a match. Once all seven spheres fill up, the player cannot train any further; however, if the player loses a match against an opponent, they will lose a sphere, and the player must train again to regain it. When all of the other wrestlers are defeated, the player must overcome the challenge of the [[non-playable character|non-playable]] final boss, "The Earl of Doom" '''Blue King''', before winning the game.

Two-player mode in ''Tecmo World Wrestling'' features the same gameplay as the single-player game.  Each player selects a wrestler (the game prevents the same character being chosen for both players) and then proceed directly into the match.  The most notable difference from the single-player game is the addition of a momentum meter onscreen that rapidly swings back and forth between both players. This meter determines which player will have the advantage in a grappling situation.
