==Gameplay==
''Red Heat'' is a [[beat 'em up]] game based on the [[Red Heat (1988 film)|film of the same name]]. The player controls Russian [[Moscow Militia]] captain Ivan Danko, who must stop drug kingpin Viktor Rostavili. The game takes place across four levels, starting with a Russian sauna where Danko must engage in hand combat against enemies. The player has a gun and limited ammunition for the next three levels, which take place in a hospital, a hotel, and a [[goods yard]]. In the final level, the player faces off against Rostavili. The gameplay occupies only the middle portion of the screen for a cinematic widescreen effect.<ref name=CU/><ref name=TGM1/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=STF/><ref name=YS/><ref name=Zap/>

Various subgames are also played throughout the main game, each with their own objective. One subgame has the player trying to break apart a hot rock using only Danko's hand. In a different subgame, the player must put a torn dollar bill back together. Another subgame has the player shoot enemies who pop out of closed doors.<ref name=CU/><ref name=TGM1/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=STF/><ref name=YS/><ref name=Zap/>

''Red Heat'' received praise for its graphics.<ref name=CU/><ref name=TGM2/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=STF/><ref name=YS/><ref name=Zap/><ref name=ACAR/><ref name="ASM">{{cite magazine|last=Zimmermann|first=Bernd|date=August 1989|title=Red Heat|magazine=[[Aktueller Software Markt]]|language=de|location=Germany|page=39}}</ref> ''[[The Games Machine]]'' noted the black-and-white color scheme of the [[ZX Spectrum]] version, but wrote "there's plenty of attention to graphic detail".<ref name=TGM1/> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' also praised the graphics despite being monochrome.<ref name=SU/> Richard Eddy of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' cited the "serious lack of colour" as the game's only letdown.<ref name=Crash/>

Mark Patterson of ''[[CU Amiga-64]]'' stated that ''Red Heat'' "isn't the best game ever to come out of Ocean, but it's by no means the worst," calling it an enjoyable game that was "marred slightly by a lack of variety on the main levels."<ref name=CU/> Gary Barrett of ''[[ST Format]]'' considered the film good but stated that it did not translate into a good game.<ref name=STF/> Reviewers for ''[[Zzap!64]]'' found the gameplay to be repetitive.<ref name=Zap/>

''The Games Machine'' criticized the difficulty and stated that the game would only appeal to fans of beat 'em up games.<ref name=TGM1/> Some criticized the limited fighting moves,<ref name=TGM1/><ref name=ACAR/> and Ken Simpson of ''Australian Commodore and Amiga Review'' criticized the joystick control.<ref name=ACAR>{{cite magazine |last=Simpson |first=Ken |date=April 1990 |title=Red Heat (Amiga) |magazine=Australian Commodore and Amiga Review |location=Australia |page=75}}</ref> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' praised the subgames for adding variety, but criticized the limited size of the screen.<ref name=YS/> Some critics praised the music.<ref name=Zap/><ref name=ACAR/> However, Patterson opined that the music and sound effects were good but "certainly not outstanding."<ref name=CU/> Barrett stated that the sound effects were good, and described the music as "tolerable".<ref name=STF/>

Several critics reviewed the game's re-release. Paul Rand of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' stated that the game "didn't exactly set the world on fire" during its initial release, but as a budget game "it's a bit of an eye-opener, with big, fast sprites and a reasonable level of difficulty."<ref name=CVG-ZX/> Rand called it "an above average interpretation of a great movie," and wrote about the cinematic display, "Not only does this add atmosphere to Red Heat, it also allows for some pretty huge graphics to shift about at a fair old pace."<ref name=CVG-C64/> ''[[Commodore Format]]'' praised the graphics, but found the gameplay tedious and annoying.<ref name=CF/> Fiona Keating of ''CU Amiga'' mentioned that the game "has a fairly high" difficulty level. Keating stated that the graphics "have an effective cinematic feel" and concluded that ''Red Heat'' "will appeal to those looking for a beat 'em up with a mean right hook, but not much else."<ref name=CU2/> Stuart Campbell, writing for ''[[New Computer Express]]'' and ''[[Amiga Power]]'', criticized various aspects of the game and stated that it had no redeeming features.<ref name=AP/><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Campbell |first=Stuart |date=10 August 1991 |title=Games Week |magazine=New Computer Express |location=United Kingdom |pages=50–51}}</ref>
