'''''Interphase''''' is a 1989 combination [[first-person shooter]] and [[puzzle video game]] developed by [[The Assembly Line]] and published by [[Image Works]] for multiple platforms.

The developers were licensed to use concepts from ''[[Neuromancer]]'', reflected in the virtual-reality cyberspace concept and theme of a powerful corporation.

The game is a [[first-person shooter]], but the game primarily focuses on puzzle-solving using the interaction between a 3D [[cyberpunk]] environment and its conceptual relationship with a 2D zoomable blueprint in which a [[non-player character]] is indirectly guided through the floors of a high-security building.

Later games that have a similar style to the 3D elements in ''Interphase'' include ''[[Pyrotechnica]]'' and ''[[Rez (video game)|Rez]]''.

==Plot==
In the future, automation of most jobs has led to boredom, which in turn has led to a boom in the leisure industry. DreamTracks, created by Dreamers who work for multi-national corporations, are recorded patterns of imagination. The general public then view these DreamTracks as a form of entertainment.<ref name="ZeroIss1">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ZeroIssue01198911DennisPublishing_Ltd|title=Zero Magazine Issue 01, November 1989|last=McCandless|first=David|date=November 1989|year=1989|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ZeroIssue01198911DennisPublishing_Ltd/page/n45 46]–49|language=en}}</ref>

The player, Chad a Dreamer discovers that subliminal messages are being inserted into DreamTracks to persuade consumers to buy certain products<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/zzapp_64_issue_056_600dpi/page/n77|title=Zzap! 64 Issue 056 (HQ)|language=en}}</ref> and more worryingly, to push certain political viewpoints and pro-government propaganda.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ZeroIssue02Dec89/page/n61|title=Zero_Issue_02_Dec_89|language=en}}</ref>

He has asked his girlfriend, Kaf-E<ref name=":1" /> to physically break into the building while he virtually infiltrates the computer to disable computer controlled defences and security systems.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/thegamesmachine-25/page/n79|title=The Games Machine Magazine Issue 25|date=December 1989}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

The action mostly takes place in two modes: a 3D cyberpunk environment and a 2D schematic map where puzzles are encountered. 3D objects in the cyberpunk environment represent objects such as security doors and cameras. To disable the real-world devices, the 3D objects must be destroyed. Puzzle-solving involves determining which objects to disable and in what order. The player must also deal with virtual defences, represented by enemy ships which pose a threat to the player's ability to jack in to the system, and which must be defeated.

While viewing the 2D schematic, the action in the 3D world continues, so it's essential that enemy ships have been dispensed with before puzzle-solving can proceed. Otherwise, the player becomes a sitting duck.

The player controls ''Chad'' in the 3D section of the game while in the 2D section ''Kaf-E'' follows a path throughout the building and attempts to reach the lift to the next level, messaging ''Chad'' if she encounters an obstacle or notices something that could assist. The player's main goal is to disable/manipulate the real world objects and security to allow ''Kaf-E'' to progress safely without getting killed by traps or caught by the security bots, as well as ensuring his virtual craft is not destroyed by the defenses. Allowing either his own craft to be destroyed or ''Kaf-E's'' safety compromised will result in a game over.

The game was ranked the 38th best game of all time by ''[[Amiga Power]]''.<ref>Amiga Power magazine issue 0, [[Future Publishing]], May 1991</ref>

==Graphical style==
[[image:Interphase in-game screenshot (Atari ST).png|thumb|right|In-game screenshot (Atari ST)]]
The 2D environment is a polygon-based schematic closely resembling an animated blueprint. A very deep zoom-in is possible and necessary. The progress of ''Kaf-E'' and the positions of moving objects (e.g., security guards) and fixed objects such as cameras can all be monitored in this view.

The 3D environment is a first-person view from the front of a virtual ship navigating a multiple-level environment. The virtual levels do not represent the floors of the building, they simply represent parts of the computer system. Navigation between levels is accomplished by flying through square panels.
