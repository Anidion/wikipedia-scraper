'''''688 Attack Sub''''' is a [[submarine simulator]] [[video game]] designed by [[John W. Ratcliff]] and Paul Grace and published in 1989 for [[MS-DOS]] and in 1990 for [[Amiga]] by [[Electronic Arts]]. A [[Sega Genesis]] version developed by [[MicroProse]] was released in 1991 by [[Sega]].

The player takes command of a US {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine|0}} or Soviet {{sclass2|Alfa|submarine|0}} [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[attack submarine]] and plays ten missions ranging from into either [[Cold War]] scenarios or combat missions in a hypothetical global conflict. As modeled in the game, the American submarine has more sophisticated electronics and more weapons. The Soviet boat has fewer weapons but higher sustained speeds. Two people can play against each other over a [[modem]] (or [[null modem]] cable).

Ratcliff and Grace later developed ''[[SSN-21 Seawolf]]'', published in 1994.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1989 gave the IBM PC compatible version a positive review, noting the game was designed to be a fun game, as opposed to a realistic simulator, and concluding that it was "this reviewer's personal candidate for 'Game of the Year'".<ref name="CGW"/> 1992 and 1994 surveys in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game two stars out of five, stating that the game was closer to World War II than modern submarine operations, and criticizing the "unrealistic" emphasis on periscope target acquisition.<ref name="brooks199206">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1992 | access-date=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

Mike Siggins reviewed ''688 Attack Sub'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it a rating of 7 out of 10, and wrote that "the appeal of using modern weapons soon wears off and one is left with only the different situations to add spice. Overall though, it is a good game on an unusual topic but would benefit from a second edition".<ref name="gi15">{{cite journal | last = Siggins | first = Mike | title = Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 15 | pages = 44–45 | date=June 1990}}</ref>
