'''''DeathTrack''''' is a first-person, futuristic [[Racing video game|racing]] game developed for [[MS-DOS]] by [[Dynamix]] and published by [[Activision]] in 1989.

==Gameplay==
There are two ways to win a race: be the first to finish the race, or be the only one to finish the race. Based in a futuristic America, the [[Player character|player]] races on various tracks across the country for money, which can be spent on armor, weapons and other modifications to protect and use against the competition. There are ten tracks in ten cities.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/games/deathtrack/pc-39232 DeathTrack - PC - IGN]</ref> The track for each city is unique, as is each opponent's 3D polygonal car.

The player chooses from one of three cars (either "The Hellcat" for high speed, "The Crusher" for high firepower or "The Pitbull" for heavy armor) and begins racing against other drivers. The player starts with $10,000 to spend on weapons, and earns more money by winning races. For each item the player buys, there are three variants: small/ineffective, medium/good and large/best.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called ''DeathTrack'' "an outstanding new action game ... gratuitous violence at its therapeutic best", praising the graphics.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=68 |title=Murder on the Backstretch / Activision's "DeathTrack" |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=February 1990 |author=Lombardi, Chris A. |pages=44 |issue=68}}</ref>
