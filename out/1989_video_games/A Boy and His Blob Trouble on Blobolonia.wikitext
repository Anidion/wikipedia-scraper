'''''A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia''''' is a [[puzzle-platform game]] developed by [[Imagineering (company)|Imagineering]] and published by [[Absolute Entertainment]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). The video game was released in North America in 1989, in Europe by [[Nintendo]] in 1991 and in Japan by [[Jaleco]] in 1991. ''A Boy and His Blob'' follows an unnamed male protagonist and his [[shapeshifting]] blob friend on their adventure to save the planet of Blobolonia from the clutches of an evil emperor.

''A Boy and His Blob'' is a [[puzzle-platform game]] that puts the player in control of the boy; its gameplay revolves around feeding his blob companion different flavored [[jelly bean]]s to alter its shape into various tools in order to overcome obstacles and traverse the game's world. ''A Boy and His Blob'' was designed and programmed by [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]]. Licensed by [[Nintendo]] in the summer of 1989, development began and was completed in an intense six-week period. Crane has described the game's overall concept of a boy accompanied by a morphing blob as unconventional and wanted to try his own hand at implementing useful tools for the player.

Critical reception for ''A Boy and His Blob'' has been mixed. Though most reviewers agreed the gameplay was original, some felt it was poorly executed. The game won the 1989 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) "Best of Show" and a 1990 [[Parents' Choice Award]]. ''A Boy and His Blob'' was followed by a sequel on the [[Game Boy]] titled ''[[The Rescue of Princess Blobette]]''. After two failed attempts to bring the series to Nintendo's other handhelds over the years, a [[A Boy and His Blob|re-imagining of ''Trouble on Blobolonia'']] was developed by [[WayForward|WayForward Technologies]] and released by [[Majesco Entertainment]] on the [[Wii]] in 2009. That same year, the original NES game was re-released on the Wii [[Virtual Console]] service in North America and [[PAL region]]s.

''A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia'' was developed by [[Imagineering (company)|Imagineering]], the in-house developer of [[Absolute Entertainment]].

Since the release of the sequel ''[[Pitfall II: Lost Caverns]]'', adventure games on the market had grown to include useful tools for players to collect and utilize in their environments. However, Crane found displayed tool inventories "not very elegant" and decided to implement tools in a different way.<ref name="retrogamermakingof">{{cite journal| journal=[[Retro Gamer]] | publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] | location=Bournemouth, UK | issue=77 | title=The Making Of: ''A Boy and His Blob'' | author=Hunt, Stuart | pages=70–3 | issn=1742-3155}}</ref> After coming up with the game's premise, a wishlist of the blob's object transformations was written and brainstormed with artists, who then converted them into computer graphics.<ref name="retrogamermakingof"/> Transformations were chosen based on how they would appear on screen due to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]'s graphical resolution. According to Crane, objects such as the bridge and ladder were "a must", but many ideas were scrapped because their nature would not be immediately obvious to the player. Puzzles that could be solved using the objects were created after the various shapes were finalized.<ref name="retrogamermakingof"/>

A total of 14 jellybean flavors were implemented in the game. To ease the game's [[difficulty level]], the flavors were named specifically as either puns or [[alliteration]] to help the player remember them.<ref name="crane" /> For instance, the punch-flavored jelly bean transforms Blobert into a hole, a play on the term "hole punch".<ref name="ignrev">{{Cite web |last=Thomas, Lucas M. |date=November 25, 2009 |title=''A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia'' Review |url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/104/1049779p1.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130022925/http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/104/1049779p1.html |archive-date=30 November 2009 |access-date=November 29, 2009 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> A grape-flavored bean listed in the game's manual was only present in the version submitted to Nintendo.

}}
Critical reception for ''A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia'' has been mixed. Many reviews published during the game's original release positively regarded the game's premise of a boy advancing by using a blob companion as a tool-set. Staff for the magazines ''[[Mean Machines]]'' and ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' and Edward J. Semrad of ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]]'' all remarked the game as having fun, challenging gameplay and being a creative and original idea.<ref name="mmrev"/><ref name="simradreview"/><ref name="Dragon157"/> The two reviewers of ''Mean Machines'' gave praise to the graphical quality of ''A Boy and His Blob'', commenting: "Some of the backdrops are digitized and superbly coloured. The boy moves smoothly <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> realistically and the Blob himself is a masterpiece of animation".<ref name="mmrev"/> Simrad, who labeled the game as an updated version of Crane's previous work ''Pitfall!'', was not as impressed by the graphics, claiming that the programmer always preferred to use the available memory for the size of the maze.<ref name="simradreview"/>

The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' found ''A Boy and His Blob'' to be strictly average due to its few enemies and a lack of scrolling screens. Although they made similar, positive comments about its unique gameplay formula, one of the writers felt it "never fully realizes its potential".<ref name="egmrev"/> This opinion was echoed by Lucas M. Thomas of [[IGN]], who gave a more negative review of the game:<ref name="ignrev"/> "While the idea behind ''A Boy and His Blob'' was certainly unique, even praiseworthy, the execution of the concept didn't exactly make for a very fun game". Thomas faulted the game's controls; its vast, empty environments; and a limited number of essential jelly beans to advance, leaving the player with "just the core gameplay gimmick of the blob's different transformations".<ref name="ignrev"/> [[1UP.com]] contributor Jeremy Parish predicted that the game's potentially frustrating, trial-and-error mechanics could subside once the player is over the learning curve and masters the limited toolset and simple interface.<ref name="retronauts"/>

As reported by Stuart Hunt of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', "''A Boy and His Blob'' proved to be a phenomenal success for Absolute Entertainment, going on to become one of the company's biggest hits and exceeding all the team's expectations".<ref name="retrogamermakingof"/> The game won "Best of Show" award for its debut at the 1989 CES.<ref name="kitchen"/> The advocacy group Parents' Choice Foundation awarded ''A Boy and His Blob'' with a [[Parents' Choice Award]] in 1990 for "portraying 'Positive human values', 'High quality software', 'Intelligent design', and the 'Ability to hold the player's interest'".<ref name="retrogamermakingof"/><ref>{{cite web | author=Classic Gaming Expo staff |year=2007 | title=Classic Gaming Expo Distinguished Guest: David Crane | url=http://www.cgexpo.com/bios/dcrane.htm | publisher=Classic Gaming Expo| access-date=October 1, 2008}}</ref> Designer David Crane was particularly proud of the latter honor, which he appreciated both before and after becoming a parent himself.<ref name="retrogamermakingof"/>

==Legacy==
Since the original release of the game, ''A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia'' has received scattered recognition from the media. In 2005, [[University of Houston]] newspaper columnist Jason Poland attributed the inspiration of the game's premise, in which a young boy befriends an outerspace being, to the central theme found in a slew of 1980s films including ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[The Last Starfighter]]''. The writer found this especially true for the former of the two features, in which the earthling protagonist supplies his alien cohort with candy. Poland explained that "although free from any Jelly Belly product placement, ''A Boy and His Blob'' encompasses plot devices from every '80s buddy sci-fi film and acts as an end cap to the entire film genre".<ref>{{cite web | author=Poland, Jason | date=August 25, 2005 | title=U.

A sequel to ''A Boy and His Blob'' was released for the [[Game Boy]] under the name ''[[The Rescue of Princess Blobette]]''.
