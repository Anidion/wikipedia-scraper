'''''Special Criminal Investigation''''', also known as '''''S.C.I.''''' for short or as '''''Chase HQ II: Special Criminal Investigation''''' in some home versions, is [[Vehicular combat game|vehicular combat]] [[racing game]] published by [[Taito]] for [[arcade video game|arcades]] in 1989. It is the sequel to the 1988 game ''[[Chase H.Q.]]''

==Gameplay==
Instead of the black [[Porsche 928]] of the first game, the player commands a red example of the just-introduced (at the time) [[Nissan 300ZX|Nissan 300ZX Z32]] T-Top [[Turbocharger|Turbo]]. Unlike the first game, the player is able to fire at offending vehicles, with some cabinets containing buttons on the steering wheel, and others having a fire button on the gearshift, along with a button to activate the nitrous boost.

The game brings back protagonists Tony Gibson and Det. Raymond Broady of the first game, and their second game appearance. Broady has taken over the driver's seat this time, while Gibson, as the passenger, serves as the gunman. Also, instead of Nancy, Karen is the officer delivering reports of whom the criminal is pursuing, and what they are driving.

Conversions for Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum were released in 1991 by [[Ocean Software]], developed by Glasgow's [[ICE Software]]. A conversion for the [[PC Engine]] (TurboGrafx-16) was released in January 1991 exclusively in Japan by Taito. [[Natsume (company)|Natsume]] ported it to the [[Master System]]. An Amstrad plus/GX4000 version was written but never released, and only a small number of cartridges are known to exist.

In 1996, Taito released an emulation of the arcade original for the [[Sega Saturn]] in Japan, bundled together with ''Chase H.Q.'' on one disc.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Taito Chase H.Q.
