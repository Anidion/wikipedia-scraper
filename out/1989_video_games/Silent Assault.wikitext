'''''Silent Assault''''' , also known as '''''Raid''''', is an [[Copyright infringement|unlicensed]] game created for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] by [[Joy Van]] and published by [[Color Dreams]]. Players control the only human who was unaffected by an alien power, as the Earth's military forces are under control from the deadly alien force.

==Gameplay==
Developed by Joy Van/Sachen and published by Color Dreams in NA and Sachen in AS. The player is the only one who is not affected by an alien power has taken over Earth's military forces. The player obtains different weapons, which drop down from the sky throughout each level, as you confront enemies. The game contains a total of eight levels which include a military base, a forest, an amusement park, and a few other places. With a boss at the end of every stage.

The player begins each game with three [[Life (video games)|lives]] and a [[Health (game mechanism)|health meter]] represented by three small shields displayed on the upper left corner of the screen. When the player comes in contact with an enemy or an enemy's projectile, half a shield is lost. Health can be recovered by collecting hearts that appear randomly when you defeat enemies. (And for some reason, whenever you kill something, it turns into a bat).

==Reception==
A writer of French magazine ''[[Anuman|Joystick]]'', scoring ''Silent Assault'' an 81%, called it an "excellent platform game", praising its challenge and varied level design. His only criticism was the "jerky" movement of the character being controlled.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Silent Assault|author=Destroy, J.M.|journal=Joystick|date=July 1990|page=121|publisher=[[Anuman]]}}</ref> On the other hand, ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' was very harsh towards the game, criticizing its presentation, ridiculously easy-to-defeat enemies and bosses, and bad storyline.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ninretro.de/img/scans/nes/Silent_Assault_ASM_11-90.jpg|title=Begnadete Korper|author=Suck, Michael|journal=[[Aktueller Software Markt]]|date=October 1990|accessdate=September 9, 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805150809/http://ninretro.de/img/scans/nes/Silent_Assault_ASM_11-90.jpg|archivedate=August 5, 2016}}</ref>
