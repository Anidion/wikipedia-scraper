{{nihongo foot|'''''Valis II'''''|ヴァリスII|Varisu Tsū|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1989 [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] originally developed by [[Telenet Japan|Laser Soft]], published by [[Telenet Japan]] and [[NEC]] for the [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD/CD-ROM²|PC Engine CD-ROM²/TurboGrafx-CD]]. A [[home computer]] version was released for [[PC-8800 series|PC-8801]], [[MSX|MSX2]], [[PC-9800 series|PC-9801]] and [[X68000]]. A [[super deformed]]-style [[Video game remake|remake]] was also released in 1992 for the [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. It is the second entry in the [[Valis (video game series)|eponymous]] series. It stars Yuko Asou, a Japanese schoolgirl teenager chosen to become the Valis warrior by wielding the titular mystical sword, after defeating the demon lord Rogles. The dream world Vecanti fell under the rule of emperor Megas, whose hatred towards his brother Rogles and bloodthirsty tendencies seeks to wipe out traces of the former tyrant, including his supporters. Gameplay varies between each version but all share similar elements, as the player explores and search for [[Item (gaming)|item]]s and [[power-up]]s, while fighting enemies and defeat [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]].

Work on ''Valis II'' did not start for a period of two and a half years, as the team became understaffed when several members had left after ''[[Valis: The Fantasm Soldier]]''. Telenet began shifting their focus in order to establish themselves in the [[LaserDisc]] market when the development moved toward. It was the first title created by [[Telenet Japan|Laser Soft]], an internal gaming division of Telenet formed specifically to explore games for the CD-ROM format, and they also cooperated with [[Telenet Japan|Renovation Game]] (Reno), which handled the home computer version. The staff hired animators for the project, as people within the [[anime industry]] were becoming interested in the [[video game industry]]. Both the TurboGrafx-CD and computer versions were made simultaneously, but each under different development lines. The Genesis remake was slated for a European release by [[UbiSoft]], as part of a multi-game licensing deal with Telenet's North American subsidiary [[Renovation Products]], but it was never officially released in the region. Each version of the game have since been re-released through download services for other [[Video game platform|platform]]s and [[Product bundling|compilation]]s.

''Valis II'' on the TurboGrafx-CD garnered generally favorable reception from critics since its initial launch, some of which reviewed it as an [[Parallel importing in video games|import title]]; praise was given to the audiovisual presentation for showcasing the potential of the CD-ROM format, but others felt mixed regarding various aspects. The home computer version carried sentiments similar to the original release, with some reviewers noting the overall dark tone of its plot. The Mega Drive/Genesis remake, however, received negative response from the gaming press. It was followed by ''[[Valis III]]'' (1990).

As with its [[Valis: The Fantasm Soldier|predecessor]], ''Valis II'' is an action-platform game starring Yuko Asou,{{efn|{{nihongo|麻生 優子|Asou Yūko}}}} a Japanese schoolgirl teenager chosen to become the Valis warrior by wielding the titular mystical sword. It takes place after the defeat of demon lord Rogles{{efn|{{nihongo|ログレス|Roguresu}}}} at the hand of Yuko. Time passes, however, the dream world Vecanti fell under the rule of emperor Megas,{{efn|{{nihongo|めがす|Megasu}}}} whose hatred towards his brother Rogles seeks to wipe out any trace of the former tyrant, to the point of murdering any supporters Rogles might have had. Furthermore, his bloodthirsty tendencies recognize Yuko and the Valis sword as viable threats to his claim of the throne, and he orders his minions to eliminate her first before she has the chance to thwart him.<ref name="MSCForce8">{{cite magazine|last=Venom|first=Dr.|url=https://archive.org/details/msx_force_12/msx_force_8/page/n25/mode/1up|title=Valis - Ascensão E Queda De Uma Serie|magazine=MSX Force|issue=8|publisher=MSXRio|date=August 2006|pages=21–27|lang=pt}}</ref> Despite details of the gameplay varying between each platform, all versions do share several similar features with ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'', and ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'' as well.<ref name="ValisIIHG101"/>

The player controls Yuko through two-dimensional [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, battling enemies, jumping from ledge to ledge, and running until the player faces a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end of each level.

''Valis II'' on the [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD/CD-ROM²|PC Engine CD-ROM²/TurboGrafx-CD]] garnered generally favorable reception from critics since its initial launch, some of which reviewed it as an [[Parallel importing in video games|import title]].<ref name="FamPCECDROMvII"/> ''[[The Games Machine]]''{{'}}s Warren Lapworth lauded the anime-style cutscenes for showing off the PC Engine CD-ROM's capabilities, while finding the game's action to be simple but enjoyable. However, Lapworth felt that the in-game graphics were uninteresting due to the drab and repetitive backgrounds, and expressed similar thoughts regarding the sprites.<ref name="TGMPCEvII"/> ''[[Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]''{{'}}s Jean-Marc Demoly commended the increasing difficulty of each level that contributed to its playability, as well as the game's visuals for the original and well-drawn enemy sprites, controls and sound, but noted that Yoko's animation lacked flexibility.<ref name="JSPCECDROMvII"/> ''Génération 4''{{'}}s Philippe Querleux gave positive remarks to the soundtrack and save system, finding it to be a very addictive title, but noted its increasing difficulty starting from the third level.<ref name="Gen4PCECDROMvII"/> An editor for ''[[TurboPlay]]'' was impressed by the game's visuals and music but disappointed by its perceived low difficulty.<ref name="TPTGCDvII"/>

''[[Tilt (French magazine)|Tilt]]''{{'}}s Alain Huyghues-Lacour commended the game for its graphics, animation and audio for showcasing the potential of the CD-ROM format.<ref name="TILTPCECDROMvII"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s four reviewers praised the intermission scenes, CD-quality soundtrack and visuals. They also found the story entertaining, but its short length and low difficulty were faulted.<ref name="EGMTGCDvII"/> ''Computer+Videogiochi'', the Italian edition of British gaming publication ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', compared the game with ''[[Rastan (video game)|Rastan]]'' but noted its variety and animated sequences.<ref name="C+VPCECDROMvII"/> In contrast, ''[[Hardcore Gaming 101]]''{{'}}s Kurt Kalata criticized its linear stages for being dull and boring, English dub and overall audiovisual presentation, regarding ''Valis II'' as "just a very mediocre and forgettable action game, only memorable for some nice creepy enemy sprites."<ref name="ValisIIHG101">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/valis-ii/|title=Valis II|work=[[Hardcore Gaming 101]]|date=July 5, 2012|access-date=2022-04-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718204058/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/valis-ii/|archive-date=2018-07-18|url-status=live}}</ref>
