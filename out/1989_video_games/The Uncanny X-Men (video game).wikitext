'''''The Uncanny X-Men''''', sometimes referred to as '''''Marvel's X-Men''''', is an [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] released by [[LJN]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] in 1989.<ref name="Release info" /> It is a licensed game based on the series of [[X-Men]] comics of the [[Uncanny X-Men|same name]] by [[Marvel Comics]]. The lineup of characters in the game is very close to those appearing in the 1989 animated pilot ''[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men]]''.

''The Uncanny X-Men'' is the only title by LJN that was developed by an undisclosed external developer. It has been speculated that it was either developed by Japanese studios [[Quest Corporation|Bothtec]] or possibly Pixel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Pixel|title=Pixel – GDRI :: Game Developer Research Institute|work=smspower.org}}</ref> However, it has never been confirmed officially. It is also the second-to-last game to be released under the Enteractive Video Games label and the last to be released before LJN was sold to [[Acclaim Entertainment]].

== Gameplay ==

The object is to use several [[X-Men]] characters, each with special powers, to complete a series of missions. The powers of each character come in handy on particular missions. The game allows for either one or two players.<ref name="Release info" /> If the 1-Player mode is selected, the player will be joined by an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] ally. The playable characters available are [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]].<ref name="Release info" /> There are five bosses in order of appearance: [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Emma Frost|The White Queen]], and [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Some characters have features that stand out. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] fight through melee combat while [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] shoot projectiles. [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] can walk through walls (to simulate teleporting). [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] cannot jump like the other characters. If the player holds on to B, they can make [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] fly.

Each character has an unlimited attack (either a punch or some type of projectile) and a special move that uses his/her energy and would kill the character if it was used up too much. The game required the players to fight their way to the [[boss (video games)|boss]] in each stage, sometimes requiring the collection of items such as keys. After the boss is defeated, the heroes have to quickly fight their way back to the beginning of the level before a bomb goes off. There are five missions: "Practice", "Future City Street Fight", "Search And Destroy The Robot Factory", "Subterranean Confrontation" and "Battle Through A Living Starship".

A sixth mission where the player battles Magneto can be accessed after the first five levels have been completed; to access the level the player must press Select, B, up on the control pad, and Start simultaneously on the game's level selection screen. This button combination is printed on the cartridge label, but not in its entirety. This is because the creators originally meant for parts of the text displayed at the end of each level to provide the player with the missing part of the code, as well as instruct him/her to combine the revealed information with the label on the cartridge to discover the full code.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tcrf.net/X-Men_(NES) |title=X-Men (NES) – The Cutting Room Floor|access-date=2013-07-15}}</ref>

==Reception==
[[Seanbaby]] listed ''X-Men'' as number 3 on his worst NES games of all time, criticizing the inaccurate depiction of the characters, the characters themselves, and the poor partner AI.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Worst Nintendo Game 3: X-Men |url=http://seanbaby.com/nes/w20-03.htm |website=Seanbaby.com |author=Seanbaby |author-link=Seanbaby |access-date=2007-05-12 |archive-date=2013-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121054129/http://www.seanbaby.com/nes/w20-03.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Skyler Miller at [[Allgame]] gave the game one star out of five, calling it a "strange, laughably bad mess of a game" and even went as far as calling it "one of the worst games ever produced".<ref>{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Skyler |title=Review |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12180&tab=review |website=[[Allgame]] |access-date=2010-03-02 |archive-date=2014-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116155117/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12180&tab=review |url-status=dead }}</ref>
