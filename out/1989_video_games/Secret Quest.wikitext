'''Secret Quest''' is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Axlon]] for the [[Atari 2600]] and published by [[Atari Corporation]] in 1989. The player controls a humanoid character that fights monsters and gathers items on a series of space stations. It was one of the last cartridges released for the console and has a larger ROM capacity than most 2600 games plus a small amount of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. The box credits [[Nolan Bushnell]] for the game and includes his photo on both the front and back. According to ''Secret Quest'' programmer Steve DeFrisco, "Atari thought that his name would entice people to buy some more 2600 titles".<ref name=halcyon/>

== Plot ==
The player controls a hero trying to stop several alien space station attacks. He is dressed in a space suit fighting aliens released from the space stations. He is trying to defuse a bomb set by the aliens, and detonate bombs in the space stations using codes.<ref name=weiss/>

== Development ==
The game was inspired by [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend Of Zelda]]'' (1986) for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]],<ref>[http://www.gooddealgames.com/interviews/int_Steve_DeFrisco.html Good Deal Games interview with Steve DeFrisco]</ref> with the final space-themed concept developed and programmed by Steve DeFrisco.<ref name=weiss>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C |title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide |last=Weiss |first=Brett |date=April 4, 2011 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786487554 |pages=103 |language=en}}</ref> Chris DeFrisco was hired to complete the artwork. A save-game mechanic was incorporated due to the design concept of having many locations in an adventure-style format. The development team faced data-size issues when trying to fit the game onto the cartridge ROM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/steve_defrisco/interview_steve_defrisco.html|title=Atari Compendium|website=www.ataricompendium.com|access-date=March 15, 2018}}</ref>

According to ''Vintage Games'', the game was created as a final attempt to prove the 1977 console could compete with more modern hardware.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKF5AgAAQBAJ&dq=last+atari+2600+game+%22secret+quest%22&pg=PA308|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|last1=Loguidice|first1=Bill|last2=Barton|first2=Matt|date=August 21, 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781136137587|language=en}}</ref> The cartridge is expanded with 256 bytes of RAM and 16 kilobytes of ROM.
