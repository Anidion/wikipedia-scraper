'''''SimCity''''' (also known as the [[retronyms]] '''''Micropolis''''' or '''''SimCity Classic''''')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simcity.com/en_US/product/simcity-classic|title=SimCity Classic|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403150258/http://www.simcity.com/en_US/product/simcity-classic|archive-date=April 3, 2014}}</ref> is a [[city-building game|city-building]] [[Construction and management simulation games|simulation]] video game developed by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], and released for several platforms from 1989 to 1991. ''SimCity'' features two-dimensional graphics and an overhead perspective. The game's objective is to create a [[city]], develop residential and industrial areas, build [[infrastructure]], and collect [[tax]]es for further [[city]] development. Importance is placed on increasing the [[population]]'s standard of living, maintaining a balance between the different sectors, and monitoring the region's environmental situations to prevent the settlement from declining and going bankrupt.

''SimCity'' was independently developed by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], beginning in 1985; the game was not released until 1989.<ref name="medium.com">{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/re-form/simcity-that-i-used-to-know-d5d8c49e3e1d |title=SimCity That I Used to Know |access-date=October 20, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020134144/https://medium.com/re-form/simcity-that-i-used-to-know-d5d8c49e3e1d |archive-date=October 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ign.com/cheats/games/simcity-1989-mac-9054 |title = IGN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724142155/http://www.ign.com/cheats/games/simcity-1989-mac-9054 |archive-date=24 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Because the game lacked any arcade or action elements that dominated the video game market in the 1980s, video game publishers declined to release the title for fear of its commercial failure until [[Broderbund]] eventually agreed to distribute it. Although the game initially sold poorly, positive feedback from the gaming press boosted its sales. After becoming a best-seller, ''SimCity'' was released on several other platforms, most notably on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) in 1991. Its gameplay was significantly revised with [[Nintendo]]'s involvement.

''SimCity'' sold 300,000 units for personal computers and nearly 2 million units for the SNES. ''SimCity'' was met with critical acclaim for its innovative and addictive gameplay despite the absence of action elements. Reviewers considered the game instructive and helpful toward the player's understanding of urban planning, politics, and economics. ''SimCity'' received numerous awards from news publishers and associations. The success of ''SimCity'' marked the beginning of the urban simulation genre of video games, as well as publisher [[Maxis]]' tradition of producing non-linear simulation games, one of which – [[The Sims (video game)|''The Sims'']] – would surpass all its predecessors in popularity and become one of the best-selling franchises in the video game industry.

==Gameplay==
The core concept of ''SimCity'' is to build and design a city without specific goals to achieve. The player may divide land into commercial, industrial, or residential [[Zoning|zones]], add buildings, change the tax rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and take any other actions to enhance the city. Once able to construct buildings in a particular area, the too-small-to-see residents, known as "Sims",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Will|author2=Joffe, B. |title=SimCity: thematic mapping+city management simulation=an entertaining, interactive gaming tool|journal=GIS/LIS '89 Proceedings. Annual Conference|date=November 1989|volume=2|pages=591–600|publisher=American Congress on Surveying and Mapping; American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|location=Orlando, FL, USA}}</ref> may choose to construct and upgrade houses, apartment blocks, light, heavy industrial buildings, commercial buildings, hospitals, churches, and other structures. The Sims make these choices based on such factors as traffic levels, availability of electrical power, crime levels, and proximity to other types of buildings—for example, residential areas next to a [[power plant]] will seldom appreciate the highest grade of housing.<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/ealbert_2001_1.pdf "SimCity Classic: History and Review"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628203447/http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/ealbert_2001_1.pdf |date=June 28, 2011}}, Eric Albert, February 2001. Fetched from URL March 15, 2011.</ref> In the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] version and later, the player can also build rewards when they are given, such as the [[mansion|mayor's mansion]] or a [[casino]].

The player may face [[disaster]]s including floods, [[tornado]]es, fires (often from [[Aviation accidents and incidents|air disasters]] or [[shipwreck]]s), [[earthquake]]s and [[Godzilla|monster]] attacks. In addition, monsters and tornadoes can trigger [[train wreck|train crashes]] by running into passing trains.

===Scenarios===
SimCity features goal-oriented, time-limited scenarios that are contingent on the player's performance and could result in either a win or a loss. The implementation of scenarios was suggested by Broderbund, as a means of transforming SimCity into a more traditional game format. This addition was intended to enhance the overall experience for players, by introducing clearly defined objectives and increasing the level of challenge in the game.<ref name = "CGW59">{{citation |date=May 1989 |last=Wilson |first=Johnny L. |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |title=What Do The "Sim"ple Folk Do? |pages=16–17 |issue=59}}</ref> In SimCity, the initial cities were modeled after real-world cities and endeavored to replicate their general layout. Although the majority of scenarios featured in the game exist within a fictional timeline or involve a city besieged by an imaginary catastrophe, a select few are based on genuine historical events. This incorporation of actual historical events adds a unique layer of realism to the game and enables players to engage with significant moments in history in a novel way.

==Development==
[[File:Micropolis - big city.png|left|thumb|A large developed city in ''Micropolis'' version (2007)]]
''SimCity'' was developed by [[game designer]] [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]]. While working on the game ''[[Raid on Bungeling Bay]]'', in which the player flies a helicopter dropping bombs on islands, Wright found he enjoyed designing the islands in the [[level editor]] rather than playing the actual game.<ref name="Keighley">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/maxis/index.html |title=SIMply Divine |website=[[GameSpot]] |access-date=June 7, 2008 |first=Geoff |last=Keighley |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204115211/http://www.gamespot.com/features/maxis/index.html |archive-date=February 4, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This led him to develop increasingly sophisticated level editors.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=75 Power Players|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|date=November 1995|page=54}}</ref> At the same time, Wright was cultivating a love of the intricacies and theories of urban planning<ref>{{cite web|title=Inside Scoop – The History of SimCity |url=http://simcity.ea.com/about/inside_scoop/sc_retrospective.php |publisher=Electronic Arts Inc |access-date=March 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710162034/http://simcity.ea.com/about/inside_scoop/sc_retrospective.php |archive-date=July 10, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and acknowledges the influence of [[System Dynamics]] which was developed by [[Jay Wright Forrester]] and whose book on the subject<ref>{{cite book|last=Forrester|first=Jay W.|title=Urban dynamics|year=1969|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-262-06026-4}}</ref> laid the foundations for what would become ''SimCity''.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Birkhauser|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-8415-9|editor1=Friedrich Borries |editor2=Steffen P.

The first version of the game was developed for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1985; it was not published for another four years.<ref name="SimCity.com (history)">{{cite web|url=http://simcity.ea.com/about/inside_scoop/sc_retrospective02.php |title=Inside scoop: The History of SimCity (page two) |work=SimCity.com |access-date=December 17, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312093210/http://simcity.ea.com/about/inside_scoop/sc_retrospective02.php |archive-date=March 12, 2009}}</ref> The original working title of ''SimCity'' was ''Micropolis''.<ref name="Will Smith.

[[Broderbund]] declined to publish the title when Wright proposed it, and he pitched it to a range of major game publishers without success. Finally, Braun, founder of the tiny software company Maxis, agreed to publish ''SimCity'' as one of two initial games for the company.<ref name="Keighley"/>

Wright and Braun returned to Broderbund to formally clear the rights to the game in 1988, when ''SimCity'' was near completion. After Broderbund executives Gary Carlston and [[Don Daglow]] saw ''SimCity'', they signed Maxis to a distribution deal for both of its initial games. With that, four years after initial development, ''SimCity'' was released for the [[Amiga]] and [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh]] platforms, followed by the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] and [[Commodore 64]] later in 1989.<ref name="SimCity.com (history)"/>

==Ports and versions==
[[File:SimCity-Indigo.gif|right|thumb|Multiplayer mode on the [[SGI Indigo]] workstation]]
After the original release on the [[Amiga]] and [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh]], the game was released on the [[Commodore 64]] and [[IBM PC compatibles]], and afterward saw more releases for computers and [[video game console]]s:  [[Atari ST]], [[Acorn Archimedes]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Acorn Electron]],<ref name="microuser199102_simcity">{{ cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/details/micro-user-096/page/20/mode/1up | title=Sim City... a major triumph? | magazine=Micro User | last1=Revis | first1=Jon | date=February 1991 | access-date=28 April 2024 | pages=20 }}</ref> [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[EPOC (computing)|EPOC32]], mobile phone, Internet, [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[FM Towns|FM-Towns]], [[OLPC XO-1]] and News HyperLook on Sun [[Unix]]. The game is available as a multiplayer version for [[X Window System|X11]] [[Tcl]]/[[Tk (computing)|Tk]] on various [[Unix]], [[Linux]], [[DESQview]] and [[IBM OS/2|OS/2]] operating systems.

Shortly after the game's initial release, Maxis released the SimCity Terrain Editor for the original versions of the game, which was sold as a mail-order add-on in [[North America]] but gained a standalone retail release in [[Europe]]. The Terrain Editor is a simple tool that allows the user to create maps with forest, land, and water portions. In 1990, Maxis developed two 'Graphics Sets' packs for the MS-DOS and Amiga versions: "Ancient Cities" and "Future Cities". Each pack contained themed sets which changed the graphics and messages in the game to fit certain themes.

In 1991, an enhanced version of the game was released for Windows 3.0/3.1. It runs in the Windows GDI with new sounds and music, either PC-Speaker type or digital/MIDI type. In 1992, to coincide with other re-releases of their games, Maxis re-released the Windows version of SimCity as "SimCity Classic", which bundled the game with the MS-DOS version of the Terrain Editor. The Graphics Sets were also reissued to run on Windows 3.1 as well. ''SimCity Classic'' was re-released in 1993 as part of the ''SimClassics Volume 1'' compilation alongside ''[[SimAnt]]'' and ''[[SimLife]]'' for PC, Mac and Amiga.<ref>{{cite magazine|title = SimClassics Volume 1 Compilation Advertisement|date = August 1994|url = https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-70/page/n115|magazine = The One|publisher = emap Images|issue = 70|page = 116}}</ref> In 1995, a [[Windows 95]] compatible version of the game titled "SimCity Deluxe CD-ROM" was released, which included new 256-color graphics and sound, and bundled the Graphics Sets and an updated Terrain Editor together with the base game.

In 1994, [[Interplay Productions]] developed and published under license from Maxis a version of the game titled "SimCity Enhanced CD-ROM" for DOS, which included 256 color graphics and FMV movies that would trigger events.

===Super Nintendo===
{{anchor|Super NES variation|Super Nintendo variation}}
The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) followed a mid-1989 call to Maxis co-founder Jeff Braun from [[Nintendo]] expressing interest in porting the game, as Nintendo developer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] was very interested in how the game allowed the player to create their own world. Braun flew to Nintendo of America's headquarters to meet with chairman [[Howard Lincoln]] and president [[Minoru Arakawa]]. They offered Braud to do all the porting to the SNES, paying Maxis $1 for every copy sold, and offering Braun a $1 million check for accepting the deal on the spot, which Braun accepted. During this development time, Miyamoto would work alongside Wright to develop means to bring the game to the console.<ref name="pc gamer snes" >https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/in-1989-a-nintendo-bigwig-licensed-simcity-on-the-spot-by-sliding-a-million-dollar-check-across-the-table/</ref>

''SimCity'' for the SNES features the same gameplay and scenario features; however, since it was developed and published by [[Nintendo]], the company incorporated their own ideas. Instead of the Godzilla monster disaster, [[Bowser]] of the [[Super Mario (series)|''Super Mario'' series]] becomes the attacking monster, and once the city reaches a landmark 500,000 populace, the player receives a [[Mario]] statue that can be placed in the city. The SNES port also features special buildings the player may receive as rewards, such as casinos, large parks, amusement parks, and expo centers; some of which would be incorporated into ''[[SimCity 2000]]''. A bank can be built which will allow a loan of $10,000 to be taken, but it must be paid back before another loan can be taken out. The game includes schools and hospitals, though they cannot be placed by the player; instead, the game will sometimes turn an empty residential lot into one. There are city classifications, such as becoming a metropolis of 100,000 people. It has some of the same pre-set scenarios in the PC and Mac versions and two new ones. One is in Las Vegas under attack by aliens and another is called Freeland. Freeland has no water, and no rewards for buildings are given. Also unique to the SNES version is a character named "Dr. Wright" (whose physical appearance is based on Will Wright) who acts as an adviser to the player. Dr. Wright was inspired by Miyamoto, at time known to fans as "Dr. Miyamoto", and Nintendo had come to recognize the value of cartoonist mascots for games, leading to Dr. Wright's creation.<ref name="pc gamer snes" /> The soundtrack was composed by Soyo Oka. The edition is featured as Nintendo's [[Player's Choice]] as a million-seller.

In August 1996, a version of the game entitled ''BS SimCity Machizukuri Taikai'' was broadcast to Japanese players via the Super Famicom's [[Satellaview]] subsystem. Later, a sequel titled ''[[SimCity 64]]'' was released for the [[64DD]], the Japan-only [[Nintendo 64]] add-on.

According to Chaim Gingold, a former Maxis employee, he believes that the time Wright spent with Miyamoto helped to influence the direction of ''SimCity 2000''.<ref name="pc gamer snes" />

===Cancelled NES version===

A version for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) was announced alongside the SNES version and had been showcased at the 1991 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], but the NES version was never properly released. However, prototype cartridges for the NES version were discovered in 2017, and one copy was obtained by [[video game preservationist]] [[Frank Cifaldi]], who extensively documented its features compared to the original personal computer game and the SNES version.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/lost-nes-version-of-simcity-emerges-after-27-years-1831308462 | title = Lost NES Version Of SimCity Emerges After 27 Years | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date = December 25, 2018 | access-date = January 4, 2019 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-date = January 5, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190105200901/https://kotaku.com/lost-nes-version-of-simcity-emerges-after-27-years-1831308462 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://gamehistory.org/simcity/ | title = Recovering Nintendo's Lost SimCity for the NES | first = Frank | last = Cifaldi | date = December 25, 2018 | access-date = January 4, 2019 | work = [[The Video Game History Foundation]] | archive-date = January 7, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190107003111/https://gamehistory.org/simcity/ | url-status = live}}</ref> It featured a completely different soundtrack (also composed by Oka) from that of the SNES version;<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kuchera |first1=Ben |title=Unearthed SimCity NES prototype includes beautiful, unheard score by Super Mario Kart composer |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/26/18156491/simcity-nes-music-mario-kart-pilotwings-soyo-oka-listen |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=July 1, 2019 |date=December 26, 2018 |archive-date=July 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701191334/https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/26/18156491/simcity-nes-music-mario-kart-pilotwings-soyo-oka-listen |url-status=live}}</ref> besides ''Metropolis Theme'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Game Music :: Interview with Soyo Oka (March 2011) |url=https://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/soyooka.shtml |website=Square Enix Music Online |access-date=July 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403035226/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/soyooka.shtml |archive-date=April 3, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> a composition that Oka herself considers one of her best works.<ref>{{cite web |title=RocketBaby's interview w/Soyo Oka |url=https://www.rocketbaby.net/interviews_soyo_oka.html |website=RocketBaby.net |access-date=July 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010305022924/http://rocketbaby.net/interviews_soyo_oka.html |archive-date=March 5, 2001 |url-status=live}}</ref>

| V.1.0 – {{vgrelease|NA|February 1989}}
| Alongside ''SimCity'' for the Macintosh, this was the first commercially released version of ''SimCity''. It ran on any Amiga with at least 512 kilobytes of memory and was distributed on a single [[floppy disk]].<ref name="Amiga HOL entry">{{cite web|url=http://hol.abime.net/1928/boxscan |title=''Sim City'' (Amiga version) |work=Hall Of Light |access-date=May 6, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503083854/http://hol.abime.net/1928/boxscan |archive-date=May 3, 2011}}</ref>
|-
| V.2.0
| This version has been enhanced with the ability to switch tilesets. A tileset consists of all the images the game uses to draw the city, and by changing the tileset one can give the city a different look and feel. The graphics support up to 64 colors in [[Amiga Halfbrite mode|Extra Halfbrite mode]]. 
Because of this new functionality, SimCity 2 requires at least 1MB of memory, twice that of the original version.

Terrain Editor for DOS included.  Addons are the 6 graphics sets.

! scope="row" | SNES
| {{vgrelease|JP|April 26, 1991|NA|August 1991|EU|September 24, 1992}}
| Developed and Published by Nintendo under license by Maxis, the SNES version of ''SimCity'' had additional features not found in the original ''SimCity'', including graphics changing to match the seasons (trees are green in summer, turn rusty brown in the fall, white in the winter, and bloom as cherry blossoms in the spring), civic reward buildings, and a very energetic green-haired city advisor named Dr. Wright (after Will Wright), who would often pop up and inform the player of problems with their city. In addition, the SNES version of ''SimCity'' had two additional bonus scenarios, accessible when the original scenarios were completed: Las Vegas and Freeland (see the section on scenarios). The style of the buildings also resembles those in Japan rather than those of North America.

A [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] port was also planned but was cancelled.

Nintendo also put their stamp on the game, with a dangerous disaster being [[Bowser]] attack on a city (in place of a generic movie-type monster), and a [[Mario]] statue awarded once the megalopolis level of 500,000 inhabitants is reached.

The SNES version of ''SimCity'' has been released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service (No longer available as of January 2, 2013).

* The July 2005 issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' stated that a development cartridge of ''SimCity'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] was found at Nintendo headquarters. Never released, it is reportedly the only one in existence.
* Additionally a terrain editor and architecture disks were available with tileset graphics for settings of Ancient Asia, Medieval, Wild West, Future Europe, Future USA and a Moon Colony.
* Versions of ''SimCity'' for the [[BBC Micro]], [[Acorn Electron]], and [[Acorn Archimedes]] computers were published by [[Superior Software]]/[[Acornsoft]]. Programmer Peter Scott had to squeeze the 512k Amiga version of the game into 25&nbsp;KB to run on the aging 32&nbsp;KB [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]]. Despite this, it kept almost all of the functionality of the Amiga game and very similar graphics (although only using four colors).<ref name="microuser199103_simcity"/>
* DUX Software published a [[Unix]] version of ''SimCity'' for the NeWS window system using the HyperLook user interface environment, and a multiplayer version of ''SimCity'' for the [[X Window System|X11]] window system using the [[Tcl]]/[[Tk (computing)|Tk]] user interface toolkit, both developed and ported to various platforms by [[Don Hopkins]].

''SimCity'' yielded several sequels. "Sim" games of many types were developed{{spaced ndash}}with Will Wright and Maxis developing myriad titles including ''[[SimEarth]]'', ''[[SimFarm]]'', ''[[SimTown]]'', ''[[Streets of SimCity]]'', ''[[SimCopter]]'', ''[[SimAnt]]'', ''[[SimLife]]'', ''[[SimIsle: Missions in the Rainforest|SimIsle]]'', ''[[SimTower]]'', ''[[SimPark]]'', ''[[SimSafari]]'', and ''[[The Sims (video game)|The Sims]]'', which spawned [[The Sims|its own series]], as well as the unreleased ''[[SimsVille]]'' and ''[[SimMars]].'' They also obtained licenses for some titles developed in Japan, such as ''[[SimTower]]'' and ''Let's Take The A-Train'' (released as ''[[A-Train]]'' outside Japan). ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'', released in 2008, was originally going to be titled "''SimEverything''"{{spaced ndash}}a name that [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] thought might accurately describe what he was trying to achieve.

''SimCity'' inspired a new genre of video games. "[[Software toy]]s" that were open-ended with no set objective were developed trying to duplicate ''SimCity''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success. The most successful was Wright's own ''[[The Sims]]'', which went on to be the best selling computer game of all time. The ideas pioneered in ''SimCity'' have been incorporated into real-world applications as well, as urban developers have recognized that the game's design was "gamification" of city planning by integrating numerous real-world systems for a city or region interacted to project growth or change. For example, [[VisitorVille]] simulates a city based on website statistics. Several real-world city improvement projects started with models inspired by ''SimCity'' prior to implementation, particularly with the onset of more connected [[smart city|smart cities]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/13/simcity-legacy-smarter-cities-when-urban-planners-play-for-keeps | title = SimCity legacy: smarter cities when urban planners play for keeps | first = Tony | last = Yoo | date = July 12, 2016 | access-date = May 12, 2020 | work = [[The Guardian]] | archive-date = June 2, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200602194936/https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/13/simcity-legacy-smarter-cities-when-urban-planners-play-for-keeps | url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-simcity-inspired-urban-planners-20190305-story.html | title = Must Reads: From video game to day job: How 'SimCity' inspired a generation of city planners | first = Jessica | last = Roy | date = March 5, 2019 | access-date = May 12, 2020 | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] | archive-date = May 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200513061721/https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-simcity-inspired-urban-planners-20190305-story.html | url-status = live}}</ref>

The series also spawned a ''[[Sim City: The Card Game|SimCity]]'' [[collectible card game]], produced by [[Mayfair Games]]. [[Rick Swan]] reviewed ''SimCity: The Card Game'' for ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine No. 221 (September 1995).<ref name="Dragon #221">{{cite journal| last = Swan| first = Rick| author-link = Rick Swan| title = Role-playing Reviews| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #221| page = 46| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]| date=September 1995}}</ref> Swan says that "While the card game doesn't scale the heights of the computer game, it comes close."<ref name="Dragon #221"/>

Dr. Wright from the SNES version has made appearances in several video games. He is a [[non-player character]] in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening]]'', and an assist trophy in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.
