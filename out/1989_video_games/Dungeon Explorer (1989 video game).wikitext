{{nihongo foot|'''''Dungeon Explorer'''''|ダンジョン エクスプローラー|''Danjon Ekusupurōrā''||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[action role-playing video game]] developed by [[Atlus]] for the [[TurboGrafx-16]] and originally published by [[Hudson Soft]] in Japan on March 4, 1989, and later in North America by [[NEC]] on November 15 of the same year. The first installment in the eponymous franchise, the game is set in the land of Oddesia, which has been overrun by an alien race and where players assume the role of one of eight [[main character]]s tasked with recovering the Ora stone to kill the alien king Natas. Co-directed by Kazutoshi Ueda and Yōsuke Niino, the title was created by most of the same team that would work on later several projects such as entries in the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series. Though it was initially launched for the TurboGrafx-16, it was later re-released through download services for various [[Video game console|consoles]].

''Dungeon Explorer'' garnered positive reception from critics during its initial release and is considered a pioneer title in the [[action role-playing game]] genre due to its [[Cooperative video game|co-operative]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] gameplay for up to five players, but has been met with a more mixed response from reviewers in recent years. It was followed by four sequels: ''[[Dungeon Explorer II]]'' (1993), ''[[Dungeon Explorer (1995 video game)|Dungeon Explorer]]'' for [[Sega CD]] and ''[[Dungeon Explorer II#Crystal Beans from Dungeon Explorer|Crystal Beans from Dungeon Explorer]]'' (1995), as well as ''[[Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Arts]]'' (2007).

== Gameplay ==

''Dungeon Explorer'' is an action role-playing game with [[dungeon crawl]] and [[hack and slash]] elements that is played in a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]] reminiscent of ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'' where players assume the role of one of the eight main characters tasked with recovering the Ora stone to ultimately kill the alien king Natas and restore peace to the land of Oddesia.<ref name="DEmanual">''Dungeon Explorer'' manual (TurboGrafx-16, US)</ref><ref name="TF1">{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3ATurboForce_US_01.pdf&page=16|title=Dungeon Explorer|magazine=[[TurboPlay#Notes: related TG-16 publications|TurboForce]]|issue=1|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=June 1992|pages=16–17}}</ref><ref name="DEhg101">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dungeon-explorer/|title=Dungeon Explorer|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=December 13, 2009|access-date=2020-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330225710/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dungeon-explorer/|archive-date=March 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Each character belongs to a class (fighter, [[thief]], [[warlock]], [[witch]], [[bishop]], [[elf]], [[bard]], or [[gnome]]) and their abilities vary primarily in their black and white magic as well as statistics.<ref name="DEmanual"/> For example, the bishop's white potion heals nearby allies, whereas the bard's black potion has the ability to change the music.

== Synopsis ==
''Dungeon Explorer'' centers on the quest of several heroes to find the Ora Stone for the king of Oddesia.<ref name="DEmanual"/> When the alien race that now rules the land invaded, the stone was hidden deep in the dungeons of the land by the King to keep it safe. Now, however, the king wants the players to recover the stone, which can bring life, light, and happiness to kill the alien king Natas.<ref name="DEhg101"/> The heroes progress through several different dungeons, fight fearsome beasts, and finally recover the Ora stone. Upon giving it to the king, the latter reveals himself as Natas and steals the stone. A guard named Judas also betrays the heroes, but is defeated by them. The adventurers then chase and confront Natas, killing him and taking back the Ora stone, ushering in a time of peace.

Developed by [[Westone Bit Entertainment|Westone]], ''Dungeon Explorer'' for the Sega CD is far closer to ''Gauntlet'' than other games in the series. Weapons and armor may be bought with the gold found in dungeons.

In 2007, two related games, again different from the original titles, were released to coincide with the release of the original ''Dungeon Explorer'' on the Wii's Virtual Console. Both ''Dungeon Explorer: Meiyaku no Tobira'' and ''Dungeon Explorer: Jashin no Ryouiki'' were released for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Nintendo DS]] respectively on November 15, 2007. Both games were localized but released as ''Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Arts''.<ref name="DE:WOAADShg101">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dungeon-explorer-ds/|title=Dungeon Explorer (DS)|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=17 December 2008|access-date=2020-08-09|archive-date=20 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020094115/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dungeon-explorer-ds/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="DE:WOAAPSPhg101">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dungeon-explorer-psp/|title=Dungeon Explorer (PSP)|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=18 December 2008|access-date=2020-08-09|archive-date=19 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219071726/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dungeon-explorer-psp/|url-status=live}}</ref>
