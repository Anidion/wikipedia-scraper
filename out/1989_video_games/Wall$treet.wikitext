Brian Walker reviewed ''Wall Street'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it a rating of 1 out of 10 (a turkey), and stated that "It might be better as a multi player game but it's doubtful. As it stands, ''Wall Street'' is merely an unusual way of finding out if you have a future as a speed typist."<ref name="gi16">{{cite journal | last = Walker |first = Brian | title =Stock Watch | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 16 | pages =19 |date=July 1990}}</ref>

Brian Carroll for ''[[Game Player's PC Strategy Guide]]'' reviewed the game and said that "''Wall$treet'' is fairly complex, presenting a market that reacts to events, dividend expenditures, borrowing, and the fluttering fortunes of the game's players."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/game-players-pc-strategy-guide-volume-4-number-3-may-june-1991/page/68/mode/2up|title = Game Players PC Strategy Guide Volume 4 Number 3 ( May June 1991)}}</ref>
