'''''Tecmo Baseball''''' is a baseball video game developed by [[Tecmo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was released in January 1989 exclusively for the [[North America]]n market.

==Summary==
There are three modes in the game; one-player, two-player, and watch ([[zero-player game|zero-player]]).  In addition to games between teams, there is also an [[all-star]] game with the best players in the game.

The game features a National division (comparable to the [[National League (baseball)|National League]]) and an American division (comparable to the [[American League]], although both divisions only include seven teams each. The National teams are: St. Louis, San Francisco, New York, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Chicago. The American division teams are: Minnesota, Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Boston, California, and Texas.

All the players on the teams have names and statistics similar to those of real Major League ballplayers. For example, a player on the Detroit team was named Arex but his statistics were those of [[Alan Trammell]] of the [[Detroit Tigers]] in 1987. The best teams in the game are St. Louis and Minnesota, the two teams that played each other in the [[1987 World Series]].
