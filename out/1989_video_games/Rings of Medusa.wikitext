'''''Rings of Medusa''''' is a [[fantasy]]-themed video game developed and published by Starbyte Software for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[MS-DOS]] in 1989. The game is a hybrid of role-playing, strategy, and trading genres. It received mixed reviews.

The game was followed by a sequel, ''[[The Return of Medusa]]'' in 1991, and an [[enhanced remake]], ''R.O.M. Gold: Rings of Medusa'', in 1994.

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2021}}

The game centers around the quest of Prince Cirion of Morenor attempting to save the kingdom from an evil spell of the demonworld queen Medusa who has split his country and forced him into exile. Cirion must find five magic rings, scattered around the country, to summon the witch for a final showdown.

The rings can be found by conquering cities, digging for treasure and a sea fight. The player must gain enough money to finance a strong army. To achieve this, the protagonist Cirion trades in goods between towns, where he is subject to bandit attacks (scouts increase view range to enable avoiding them). On the map the player may also dig for treasures, conquer cities and install troops to defend that town, and later cross the large ocean and visit other islands.

Within the game, the player controls directly only the squadron that Cirion is with, whereas the other troops use a defense plan chosen previously. When the player visits a city, a control screen appears, with options to sell and buy wares, gamble in the casino, gather information on temples and recruit troops.

==Legacy==
In the sequel, ''[[The Return of Medusa]]'', it is revealed that the vanquishing of Medusa is not done as she has just escaped 300 years into the future, so Cirion follows her there to defeat once for all. It is a first-person-point-of-view role-playing game.

A remake titled ''R.O.M. Gold: Rings of Medusa'' was developed by Starbyte Software and published by General Admission Software for the Amiga and PC DOS in 1994. In comparison with the original version, the game features enhanced graphics and sound, as well as an improved interface. ''R.O.M. Gold'' received generally positive scores, including 79% from both ''Amiga Games'' and ''Amiga Joker'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=4826 |title=DIE Kult-Seite über die alten Spiele-Magazine und Retro-Games! |website=Kultboy.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_17094 |title=Rings of Medusa Gold review from Amiga Joker (Oct 1994) - Amiga Magazine Rack |website=Amr.abime.net |date= |accessdate=2016-06-27}}</ref> and 71% from ''Power Play''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=6939 |title=DIE Kult-Seite über die alten Spiele-Magazine und Retro-Games! |website=Kultboy.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-27}}</ref>
