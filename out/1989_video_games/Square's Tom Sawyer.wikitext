{{Nihongo|'''''Square's Tom Sawyer'''''|スクウェアのトム・ソーヤ|Sukuwea no Tomu Sōya|}} is a [[role-playing video game]] produced by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] that was released exclusively in Japan in 1989 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (the Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System). The game is directly based on [[Mark Twain]]'s renowned 1876 novel, ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', and was developed in the [[role-playing video game]] niche that made Square famous with its acclaimed ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series of video games.

==Development==
''Square's Tom Sawyer'' was scored by famed ''Final Fantasy'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], who is described as taking a more "scenic" approach to the game than his previous works.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Greening |title=Nobuo Uematsu |publisher=Square Enix Music |date=2011-06-01 |url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/uematsu/index.shtml |access-date=2013-02-25 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404170938/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/uematsu/index.shtml |archive-date=April 4, 2013}}</ref> Artist Katsutoshi Fujioka worked on the game title as well.<ref name=shmup>{{cite web|url= http://shmuplations.com/historyofsquare/|title= The History of Square – 1992 Developer Interview|accessdate=May 31, 2020|date=January 1, 1992|publisher= Dengeki SFC magazine}}</ref> Around the time that Sakaguchi was writing scenarios for what would become the original ''Final Fantasy'',  Hiromichi Tanaka decided to make a game based on "Tom Sawyer" at the same time and formed a team to make it.<ref name=interviewz/> Takashi Tokita developed some of the graphics, and designed Tom Sawyer as well, but working on the game was difficult for Square to do as teams struggled to finish both games at once, and help was given by the different teams to complete the titles.<ref name=interviewz/><ref name=answer1>{{cite book|page=191|date=February 2018|title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers|volume=3|author=Szczepaniak, John|publisher=SMG Szczepaniak}}</ref>

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Square Tom Sawyer screenshot blackface.png|thumb|right|Speaking to Tom, Jim displays a typical [[blackface]] caricature.]]
The game was never localized outside Japan, and was noted by ''[[IGN]]'' as an example of racism in video games.<ref>{{cite web|author=Levi Buchanan |title=A History of Insensitivity |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2009-03-06 |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2009/03/06/a-history-of-insensitivity |access-date=2013-02-25 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225034125/http://m.ign.com/articles/2009/03/06/a-history-of-insensitivity |archive-date=2016-02-25}}</ref> In 2010, ''[[UGO]]'' ranked it as the #4 most racist video game in history.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 11 Most Racist Video Games|author=Jensen, K.

The portrayal of black people as [[blackface]]d caricatures with huge lips has been noted about the game.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tristan Donovan |title=Mortal Kombat - A Book Excerpt from Replay: The History of Video Games |publisher=Yellow Ant Publishing |date=2010-04-20 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134205/mortal_kombat__a_book_excerpt_.php?print=1 |access-date=2013-02-25 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511100837/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134205/mortal_kombat__a_book_excerpt_.php?print=1 |archive-date=2013-05-11}}</ref> In ''[[GameSpy]]'''s retrospective overview of the Famicom, Benjamin Turner and Christian Nutt's Square column concludes that "one of the most amusing Square games that didn't come [to the U.S.] was ''Square's Tom Sawyer'', an RPG starring the happy-go-lucky boy wonder that featured a...racially insensitive...character". Artist [[Takashi Tokita]] explained in 2018 that when the game was made, there was not a "standards and practices"  department to ensure that games did not contain materials that would be offensive in other cultures.<ref name=answer1/>
