'''''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''''', known as {{nihongo foot|'''''Geki Kame Ninja Den'''''|激亀忍者伝||lit. "Legend of the Radical Ninja Turtles"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan and '''''Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles''''' in Europe, is a 1989 [[side-scrolling]] [[Platform game|action-platform]] game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] released by [[Konami]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=8824|title=激亀忍者伝 [ファミコン] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref>  In North America it was published under Konami's [[Ultra Games]] imprint in the US and the equivalent PALCOM brand in Europe and Australia.

Alongside the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|arcade game]] (also developed by Konami), it was one of the first video games based on the 1987 ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' animated series, being released after the show's [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) episodes#Season 2 (1988)|second season]]. The game sold more than {{nowrap|4 million}} cartridges worldwide.

==Plot==
[[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] kidnaps April and gains the Life Transformer Gun, a weapon capable of returning [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] to his human form. In order to save April, the turtles ([[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leo]],   [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Mikey]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donny]] and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raph]]) embark on the streets of New York to confront the Foot Clan. While traversing the sewers, the turtles encounter Bebop, a mutated pig, and Rocksteady, a mutant rhino. Though the turtles defeat Bebop, Rocksteady escapes with [[April O'Neil|April O’Neil]]. The turtles then chase Rocksteady to an abandoned warehouse, fight him, and rescue April. After disabling bombs in the Hudson River dam, Shredder captures Splinter, so the turtles give chase in the Party Wagon. Hot in pursuit, the turtles scour the city and eventually find that Splinter is held captive by the robotic Mecaturtle on a skyscraper rooftop.  After the turtles save Splinter, Shredder escapes in a helicopter.  The turtles give chase, tracking him to JFK airport, where they encounter Big Mouser. After defeating Big Mouser, the turtles head to Shredder's secret Foot Clan base in the South Bronx via the Turtle Blimp.  Once there, they locate and battle the Technodrome underground. The turtles descend into the Technodrome's reactor and ultimately defeat Shredder. With the Life Transformer Gun, the turtles help Splinter return to his human form. With a tough mission accomplished, the turtles and April celebrate with a pizza.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1989 video game) gameplay.png|frame|left|[[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] surrounded by Mousers in the sewer]]
''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' is a single-player [[action game]]. The player starts the game as Leonardo, but can switch to any of the other turtles by pressing the start button and accessing the information screen. The information screen shows each turtle's health, special weapons, a map grid of the current area, and messages from either Splinter or April. Each primary weapon has a different speed, power, and reach.  Thus, during gameplay, certain turtles may be more adept at defeating certain enemies and navigating particular obstacles than others. When a turtle runs out of health, falls into a fatal trap, or is struck by a roller car, the Foot Clan captures the turtle and holds him in an undisclosed location.  This forces the player to choose one of the remaining turtles in order to continue. The player loses the game when all four turtles are captured. From stage three onward, a captured turtle may be rescued once per each area of gameplay. Overall, six stages (missions) comprise the game: 1) Streets of New York 2) Hudson River Dam 3) Wall Street Rooftops 4) JFK Airport 5) South Bronx Lair 6) Technodrome.

Initially, a player navigates the mission map in an overhead view.  When a turtle enters a sewer or building interior, gameplay switches to a side-scrolling perspective.  While in the overhead view, a player can move in four cardinal directions and use primary weapons for a single type of attack. As the game progresses, more lethal and numerous enemies appear.  In later stages, obstacles include gaps that involve well-timed jumps and inaccessible areas that require specialty items, such as ropes, to progress across building rooftops.

In side-scrolling portions of the game, the turtles jump, crouch, and attack with primary or alternate weapons. Alternate weapons are occasionally dropped by enemies or found along the way in limited quantities.  These weapons include single shurikens (throwing stars), triple shurikens (launches three stars simultaneously in a spreading pattern) and boomerangs. A powerful "Kiai" weapon, a scroll that expands into a crescent-shaped beam, may be found in later stages. A limited number of invincibility icons also appear throughout the game, which grant a temporary "cannonball" invincibility effect and allows a turtle to bulldoze their way through enemies and obstacles.  On a side note, boomerangs can be reused if the player catches them upon return.  Lastly, if a turtle acquires a new weapon, it will replace the previous alternate weapon.

As the game progresses, the turtles must defeat various enemies, navigate traps, search for specific items, and complete certain tasks, such as defusing timed bombs in the underwater area of stage two. During gameplay, the turtles collect [[pizza]] to replenish health.  The amount of health restored is dependent on pizza portions (whole, half, or slice).  A player is given a limited number of continue options.  Boss confrontations include Bebop (stage one mid-boss), Rocksteady (stage one boss), Mecaturtle (stage three), Big Mouser (stage four), the Technodrome (stage five), and [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]].

==Releases==
===Regional differences===
The game was released for the [[Family Computer]] (Famicom) in [[Japan]] a few months earlier than the American NES version under the title {{nihongo||激亀忍者伝|Geki Kame Ninja Den|which loosely translates to "Legend of the Radical Ninja Turtles"|lead=yes}}.<ref name=":0" /> This was the first ''TMNT'' product released in the country, predating the Japanese dub of both [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|the first film]] and the animated series. Subsequent ''TMNT'' video games released in Japan kept the franchise's original title. While graphics and gameplay are virtually identical to its NES counterpart, the Japanese localization changed the plot a bit by turning April O'Neil from an acquaintance of the Turtles into Splinter's daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vivi200x200.blog50.fc2.com/blog-entry-1314.html|title=''Geki Kame Ninja Den'' manual scans|language=Japanese}}</ref>

The game was released as ''Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles'' in all European territories, in line with the renaming of the first cartoon series in those territories.

===Ports===
The game was ported to various [[home computer]] platforms in 1990. Konami, under the Ultra Games label, released [[DOS]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Amiga]] versions in North America, while the game was licensed to [[Mirrorsoft]]'s [[Image Works]] label for the European market, where DOS, Commodore 64, Amiga, [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Atari ST]], and [[MSX]] versions were released. The European Amiga port is different from the North American version. The initial release of the DOS version contains a programming error that creates a gap that is impossible to cross without cheating or a patch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scary-crayon.com/games/tmnt12pc/ |title=Scary-Crayon reviews...

It was released in 2007 on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]]. It was released for the Wii in Europe and Australia for 500 points which was later raised to 600 Wii Points. In North America, it was released for Wii on April 2, 2007, for the price of 600 points—100 points more than the average NES game—due to a licensing issue.<ref name="wiipoints">{{cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/791/791978p1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070528170452/http://wii.ign.com/articles/791/791978p1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = May 28, 2007 | publisher = IGN | title = Konami Talks Virtual Console | quote = As you know, currently we do not hold the video game license for TMNT, so we had to create a new licensing deal for these titles | author = Dennis Lee, group manager for Konami }}</ref> It was the first licensed game to appear on the North American and European Virtual Console. Due to licensing issues, it was later removed from the [[Wii Shop Channel]] in Japan on January 24, 2012, and in North America and Europe on January 26, 2012.

The NES version of the game was re-released as part of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection]]'' in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection Has a Release Date |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-has-a-release-date |last=Bailey |first=Kat |date=July 21, 2022 |access-date=August 29, 2022 |website=IGN}}</ref>

However, it received a mixed critical reception upon its original NES release. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' scored it 4 out of 5 and praised its "superb play control" and "super-sharp graphics".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.defunctgames.com/reviewcrew/20/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-what-did-critics-think-in-1990 | title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: What Did Critics Think in 1990? - Defunct Games }}</ref> The game would be voted as the year's best game by readers as part of the magazine's annual ''Nintendo Power Awards''.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Nintendo Power Awards '89 |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |location= |publisher=Nintendo of America |date=March–April 1990 }}</ref> Conversely, ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s panel of four reviewers scored it 6, 7, 6 and 4 out of 10, the latter describing it as a "disappointment."<ref name="EGM"/>

The ZX Spectrum port was reviewed more positively. ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' gave the game a 90% rating, praising the game's colorful, cartoonish graphics and move sets while also criticizing the game's swimming level.<ref name="yourslinclar2reve"/>

When the NES game was re-released on Virtual Console in 2007, it attracted largely negative reviews. GameSpot's Frank Provo gave Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.7 out of 10, citing the game's very hard difficulty and the game's unpolished and unfun nature as reasons for the rating.<ref name="gmsptrevw"/> Provo also stated that, while the game's music is upbeat, the music and the game in general lacks the more recognizable traits of the ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' franchise.<ref name="gmsptrevw"/>  Mark Birnbaum of [[IGN]] gave ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' a 5.5 out of 10 pointing out that the game is dated and only for nostalgic and hardcore fans. Birnbaum stated that the controls were poor, the enemies bland and the level design and characters were negatives in the game.<ref name="ignrvew"/> Both reviewers also cited its poor quality in comparison to Konami's later ''Turtles'' NES games, which were not re-released.
