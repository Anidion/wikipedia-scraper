'''''Strider''''', released in Japan as {{Nihongo foot|'''''Strider Hiryū''''',|ストライダー飛竜|Sutoraidā Hiryū|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[hack-and-slash]] [[platform game]] released in [[Arcade video game|arcades]] in 1989 by [[Capcom]]. Set in a [[dystopian]] future where Earth is ruled by the tyrannical Grandmaster Meio, it follows the titular Strider named Hiryu as he attempts to end his tyrannical reign for good. The game resulted from cooperation between Capcom and manga publisher [[Moto Kikaku]]. It marked the video game debut of Strider Hiryu, after the character was introduced in the 1988 [[manga]] ''Strider Hiryu''.

The game debuted on Capcom's [[CP System]] arcade board. Various home computer ports were developed by [[Tiertex]] and published by [[U.S. Gold]] in 1989. The [[Strider (NES video game)|NES version]] has a different plot than the original. [[Sega]] released ''Strider'' for its own [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in 1990. Of all home versions, the Genesis adaptation is considered the most successful, winning the Game of the Year and Best Graphics in a Video Game awards from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' in 1990.

''Strider''{{'s}} gameplay is cited as a major influence on the video game franchises ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'', ''[[Devil May Cry]]'', and ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]''. It became one of Capcom's early hits, praised for its innovative gameplay, diverse and unique music, and multilingual voice samples.

[[Image:Strider.png|thumb|left|The Kazakh SSR stage]]

The controls of ''Strider'' consist of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons for attacking and jumping. The player controls the protagonist [[Strider Hiryu]], a [[ninja]] whose main weapon is a [[tonfa]]-like plasma sword known as a "Cypher". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.

Numerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These include an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the [[kanji]] used to write Hiryu's name: [[wiktionary:飛|飛]] and 飛竜), a max health extension (represented by the kanji [[wiktionary:竜|竜]], the second character in Hiryu's name), an [[extra life]], and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.<ref name=psmanualp17>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 17}}</ref> Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as "options" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two [[mushroom]]-like droids, a [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed robo tiger]] and a robot [[hawk]], known individually as Options A, B and C respectively.<ref name=psmanualp18>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 18}}</ref>

The game has five stages: the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] (called "[[St. Petersburg]]" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the [[Siberia]]n Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog, the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian Jungle]], and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions). Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game's timer reaches zero. It is [[Game Over]] when all of Hiryu's lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.

==Plot== <!-- Please note: This page is for the original arcade game Strider. The name Hiryu Lyons is not supported by Capcom.
Hiryu' and only Hiryu is the original character's code name while 'Strider' is used as a prefix to denote his affiliation within this group. -->

''Strider'' is set in a [[dystopia]]n future in the year 2048, where a mysterious dictator known as the "Grandmaster" rules over the world.

Hiryu begins his mission by infiltrating the Grandmaster's capital at the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]], a [[Federation]] referred to as Eastern European which became the Imperial Capital of the [[Russian Empire]] by the year 2048.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strider Hiryû (Japanese). Instruction manual, Megadrive|publisher=Sega|date=September 1990|page=18}}</ref> The game features multilingual voice clips during cutscenes (presented in [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]]).

==Development==
The arcade version of ''Strider'' was part of a three-way project conceived in a collaboration between [[Capcom]] and Hiroshi Motomiya's manga studio [[Moto Kikaku]], which also included the ''Strider Hiryu'' [[manga]] by Moto Kikaku's Tatsumi Wada that was published in [[Kodansha]]'s ''Comic Computique'' anthology in Japan, as well as the [[Strider (1989 NES video game)|NES version of ''Strider'']]. Kouichi Yotsui, director of the coin-op ''Strider'' (who is credited as Isuke in the game), was chosen for his experience with the [[CP System]] hardware while working as a background designer on ''[[Ghouls 'n Ghosts]]''. The three projects were developed independently of each other.<ref name=Gameside>{{Cite journal|last1=Tane|first1=Kiyofume|last2=Gaijin Punch (translation)|title=The Father of Strider Who Made the Game World Explode: Kouichi Yotsui Discography|journal=Gameside|issue=16|date=February 2009|url=http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2313&type=translation&p=2|access-date=30 Dec 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222000306/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2313&type=translation&p=2|archive-date=2014-12-22}}</ref>

According to Yotsui the franchise was conceived as a [[multimedia]] collaboration between video game company [[Capcom]] and [[manga]] collective [[Moto Kikaku]], the two companies having previously collaborated on the video game versions of the manga ''[[Tenchi wo Kurau]]''. Moto Kikaku produced the manga version, while Capcom developed two separate video game versions, a coin-operated video game and a console version for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]. All three works share common plot elements, while featuring their differences as well.<ref name=Gameside/> He further said it was he who "pushed for a ninja concept" as they were leaning towards an action game, a ninja setting would've been convenient. "The hero would be derived from a ninja. We loosely decided on that."<ref name=ky>Scion; Dire 51 (24 April 2010). [http://lscmainframe.kontek.net/features/kyotsui.html "Interview with Kouichi "Isuke" Yotsui".] LSCM 4.0. Translated by Gaijin Punch. Accessed 5 October 2011.</ref> Regarding Hiryu's three robot helpers, he said that he was inspired by the 1960s ninja comics (the one that most influenced him was [[Shirato Sanpei]]'s ''[[Kamui (1964 manga)|Kamui Gaiden]]''), in which the ninja often had various animals to support them or attack their enemies.<ref name=ky/> Speaking with ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', Yotsui said that Strider Hiryu's climbing abilities were inspired by his personal experience when he got himself stranded on the roof of Capcom’s building; fearing freezing to death and with no way to call for help, he climbed down the side of the building to reach a nearby [[fire escape]] stairway.<ref>Dave Cook, [http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1264471/5_insane_amazing_origins_of_iconic_game_characters.html 5 Insane & Amazing Origins Of Iconic Game Characters (Feature)], NowGamer, February 29, 2012.</ref>

The original arcade game soundtrack was composed entirely by female video game music composer Junko Tamiya, who was not credited for her work in the arcade version but was mentioned as part of the original arcade staff in some console adaptations. Early revisions of the arcade game were missing the unique music for the Aerial Battleship and Third Moon stages. In this version the music from the first stage of the game was repeated here instead.<ref name="Tamiya"/>

''Strider'' contains many different styles of themes that change dynamically throughout the game according to the stages and the situations on screen. These range from [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[art rock|progressive]] futuristic [[sci-fi]] action themes to [[baroque music|baroque]], [[indigenous music|tribal]] and [[classical music|classical]] music pieces. Elements from the soundtrack have also been used in other Capcom games where Hiryu has appeared. These include the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series as well as other ''Strider'' related games.<ref name="Tamiya"/>

==Ports==
Ports of ''Strider'' for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s, and [[ZX Spectrum]] were published by [[U.S. Gold]] and developed by [[Tiertex]] in 1989. The U.S. Gold versions have the order of the third and fourth stages swapped (the order of the [[cut-scene]]s were kept the same, causing a continuity error), and the final battle with the Grandmaster missing (the last stages end with the battle against the giant robot gorilla Mecha Pong). As a result, the ending was changed to reveal that the events of the game were a simulation that the player was going through. All five versions featured downgraded graphics, less music and missing enemies compared to the arcade version. Additionally, the controls were modified so that the game would be compatible with one-button joystick controllers. Despite these changes, all of the U.S. Gold releases received high review scores by computer game magazines of the time. Later, in 1992, the assets of the Amiga versions were used for the conversion on the [[Master System]], also made by Tiertex. A final fight with the Grandmaster was added in this version, but the ending credits continue to say that all was just a simulation.

[[Sega]] produced their home version of ''Strider'' for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], which was released in Japan on September 29, 1990, with subsequent releases in North America and the [[PAL region]]. It was advertised as one of the first 8-Megabit cartridges for the system, and went on to be a bestseller.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue110/Pages/CVG11000078.jpg |title=Welcome to nginx! |website=www.worldofspectrum.org |access-date=3 February 2022 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140615174929/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue110/Pages/CVG11000078.jpg |archive-date=15 June 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> <!-- Game of the year and best graphics status is mentioned in the Reception section --> This version was also re-released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on November 15, 2011 and in North America on February 16, 2012.

This ending shows the destruction of the final stage as the game's protagonist makes his escape. This is then followed by the main credit sequence that sees Hiryu flying his glider in space and reminiscing about the various encounters he had during his mission as he heads back to earth. The ending theme was an edited combination of two separate pieces of music planned for the arcade game, but replaced with a repeat of the first level music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTxZ-uwcf04#t=2785 |title=Capcom Game Syndrome (Laserdisc) |publisher=YouTube.com |access-date=2015-04-09}}</ref> Computer magazine ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' considered the previous Amiga conversion to be "as good as this one".<ref name="ace"/>

Capcom separately produced a version for the [[Sharp X68000]] computer in 1991, releasing it exclusively in Japan. It is a very close reproduction of the arcade original, with minimal changes.

A version for the [[Capcom Power System Changer]] was planned and previewed but never released.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/club-capcom-spring-1994_202202#page/n89/mode/2up|title=カプコン アーケードオリジナルボード CPSシリーズ+CPSチェンジャー 限定販売決定!!|magazine=Club Capcom|volume=2|publisher=[[Capcom]]|date=Spring 1994|pages=90–91|lang=ja}}</ref>

[[NEC Avenue]] produced a [[PC Engine CD]] version of ''Strider Hiryu'', which was released exclusively in Japan on September 22, 1994 as a [[CD-ROM]]² title which requires the Arcade Card expansion. It features an all-new desert stage that was not in the arcade version, as well as newly recorded cut-scenes, music and dialogue, with Japanese voice actor [[Kaneto Shiozawa]] as the voice of Hiryu and [[Kōji Totani]] as the Grand Master. The PC Engine CD version had a long development process, having been planned in various formats, including the [[SuperGrafx]] at one point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lscmainframe.net/features/supergrafx/|title=The Rumored SuperGrafx Conversion|publisher=LSCM 4.0|access-date=21 Dec 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723193203/http://www.lscmainframe.net/features/supergrafx/ |archive-date=July 23, 2011}}</ref>

The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version of ''Strider'' was first released by Capcom in 2000 as a second disc which came packaged with the PlayStation version of ''[[Strider 2 (1999 video game)|Strider 2]]''. The North American release has the ''Strider'' and ''Strider 2'' game code pressed onto the wrong disc. This version was reissued separately in Japan on October 24, 2006 as part of the ''Capcom Game Books'' series, which included an extended manual and strategy guide for the game.<ref name="capcombooks">{{cite web|url=http://books.capcom.co.jp/product/game/gamebook-hiryu.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017135548/http://books.capcom.co.jp/product/game/gamebook-hiryu.html|archive-date=2008-10-17|script-title=ja:カプコン ゲームブックス ストライダー飛竜|language=ja|access-date=2015-04-09}}</ref> This makes this standalone version technically the last original PlayStation game ever made, released after the system's discontinuation in March 2006.

The original arcade version was included in the 2006 video game compilations ''[[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection: Remixed]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and ''Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].

===Reviews===
''Strider'' opened to critical acclaim, particularly for its gameplay, graphics, diverse music, and voice samples. The original arcade game received positive reviews from critics upon release. ''[[The Games Machine]]'' called it "THE [[Platform game|platform and ladders game]] to be seen playing at the moment."<ref name="TGM"/> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' called it "brilliant" and "a real epic" with "some imaginative stuff" in the game.<ref name="YS_ARC"/> ''[[Commodore User]]'' praised the "high definition graphics, brilliant movements and good old-fashioned blasting action" along with a "bit of tongue-in-cheek political" content.<ref name="CU67"/>

The Genesis version was praised for its accurate and detailed faithfulness to the original. Upon release, ''[[GamePro]]'' called the Genesis port "a faithful translation of the arcade hit", and praised its "gorgeous graphics, non-stop arcade-style action, and ... captivating and unusual sound track."<ref name="GP27">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/90/GamePro_US_017.pdf#page=124 |title=Genesis ProView: ''Strider'' |author=Andromeda |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=27 |date=December 1990 |pages=122–123}}</ref> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' awarded the Genesis port best [[List of Game of the Year awards|video game of the year]] in 1990 and winner of their best graphics category.<ref name="egm15">{{Cite magazine|title=The 1991 Video Game Buyer's Guide|magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly|issue=15|date=October 1990|pages=14–20}}</ref>

According to ''Retro Gamer''{{'}}s Darran Jones, "everything about Strider was epic. Its backgrounds were brilliantly designed and featured an array of exotic locations, while its sprite design was superb. There was a uniqueness to ''Strider'' art design that gave it a distinctive look back in 1989 and still makes it stand out brilliantly today. It's a mysterious mish-mash of different cultures that ensured it stood out from its arcade peers." Jones also praised the game's "stunning animation", gameplay, and controls, as well as its "superbly atmospheric" soundtrack.<ref name=ug>"Ultimate Guide: Strider" in ''Retro Gamer'' 121.</ref>

Mark Caswell of ''Crash'' magazine referred to the game's graphics as detailed and incredible, the scrolling and action as smooth and called the gameplay "some of the most demanding gameplay ever invented".<ref>Caswell, Mark (May 1989).

==Legacy==

===NES game===
{{Main|Strider (1989 NES video game)}}

''[[Strider (1989 NES video game)|Strider]]'' was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] exclusively in North America a few months after the arcade version's release. This version was produced alongside the arcade game but follows the plot of [[Moto Kikaku]]'s tie-in manga. A [[Famicom]] version of the same game was planned for release in Japan, but never made it to the shelves.

===Sequels===
{{Main|Strider II (1990 video game)|Strider 2 (1999 video game)}}

Under license from Capcom U.S.A., [[U.S. Gold]] and [[Tiertex]] produced a ''Strider'' sequel in Europe titled ''[[Strider II (1990 video game)|Strider II]]'' (released in North America as ''Journey From Darkness: Strider Returns'') for various computer platforms, as well as the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Game Gear]], and [[Master System]] home consoles. This European-produced sequel was not released in Japan. Like the previous conversions of the original game, the quality of this one was very low. Capcom later produced another sequel, unrelated to the Tiertex-produced ''Strider Returns'', titled ''[[Strider 2 (1999 video game)|Strider 2]]'', which was released for the arcades and the [[PlayStation]] in 2000.

===Reboot===
{{Main|Strider (2014 video game)}}

===Other appearances===
Strider Hiryu also appears as a playable character in the 1998 fighting game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]'', which was followed by ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' in 2000. Hiryu has also made minor appearances in other Capcom-related games such as ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash]]'', ''[[Namco × Capcom]]'', ''[[Project X Zone 2]]'' and ''Adventure Quiz: Capcom World 2'', including a small cameo appearance in [[Ken Masters|Ken]]'s stage in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 2]]''.

''Strider'' director Kouichi Yotsui left Capcom soon after its release. He later designed [[Osman (video game)|an unofficial, coin-operated sequel]] for [[Mitchell Corporation]] in 1996. Yotsui considers that game, titled ''Cannon-Dancer'' in Japan and ''[[Osman (video game)|Osman]]'' in the West, a "self-parody" of his work on ''Strider''.<ref name=Gameside /> ''[[Moon Diver]]'' is a 2011 [[Square Enix]] game that shares some of the same gameplay elements and was also created by Yotsui.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yin |first=Wesley |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-03-30-father-of-strider-talks-moon-diver |title="Father" of Strider talks Moon Diver |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2011-03-30 |access-date=2015-04-09}}</ref> The game [[Run Saber]], released by [[Atlus]] in 1993 for the [[Super NES]], is often compared to Strider due to them being similar in play mechanics.
