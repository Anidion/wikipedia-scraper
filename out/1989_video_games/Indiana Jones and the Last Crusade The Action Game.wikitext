''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave the game a negative review and said it was "just another search and recover game" with little to do with Indiana Jones. The review praised the graphics and sound, but found the fight sequences both too easy and too short, since all enemies could be defeated in one hit and turned their backs shortly after attacking the player.<ref name="CGW"/> ''[[Compute!]]'' liked the Commodore 64 version, approving of the graphics and describing gameplay as "quite addicting", but criticizing lack of savegame and replay value.<ref name="randall198912">{{Cite magazine |last=Randall |first=Neil |date=December 1989 |title=64/128 |url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_115_1989_Dec#page/n13/mode/2up |magazine=Compute! |pages=12, 14}}</ref>
