'''''Mines of Titan''''' is a [[single-player]] [[role-playing video game]], developed by [[Westwood Associates]] (later [[Westwood Studios]]), and released by [[Infocom]] in 1989 for [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[MS-DOS]].

==Remake==
''Mines of Titan'' is a [[Video game remake|remake]], or update, of the [[Commodore 64]] game ''[[Mars Saga]]''. ''Mines of Titan'' is lengthier, with some new storylines, a few more creatures and a few details like colors are different. And of course the game's location is moved from [[Mars]] to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The cities and maps look the same.

==Plot==
''Mines of Titan'' is set in the year 2261, well into the era of mankind's colonization the [[inner Solar System]]. The game takes place on a barely [[Terraforming|terraform]]ed [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest [[moon]] of the [[gas giant]] [[Saturn]], at the edge of frontier space.

The player character is a charismatic 22-year-old [[astronaut]] Tom Jetland, who has crashed on Titan after bullet-sized rocks from the [[Rings of Saturn]] pierced his ship's hull. Forced to eject payload and has no means of transport off the world. In order to raise money, Jetland must search for, recruit, create and control a party of characters ready for exploration and combat. The player develops Jetland and other characters by improving their natural attributes and by adding and training in over twenty new skills which will aid in both the central quest and various side missions.

Success depends upon competence in battle with various creatures and human foes alike; exploration of underground colonies and mining settlements; using characters' skills to their best advantage; utilising a wide array of weaponry and aid acquired from merchants; and most importantly tracking down the clues to solve the mysteries of Titan. For only by uncovering a vast conspiracy and learning the fate of the disappeared Proscenium Colony (presumably named after the [[Proscenium]] "archway" of a theatrical stage) will the player be able to raise enough credits to pay for safe passage off Titan.

==Feelies==

[[Infocom]] often released their games with merchandise referred to as [[feelies]]. ''Mines of Titan'' originally came on [[floppy disk]] format which was provided in a [[secret agent]]-style packaging, which also contained a thirty-seven page manual and various [[Paraphernalia (disambiguation)|paraphernalia]], such as a "command reference card"; supposedly secret classified military and scientific documents; weapons schematics; illustrations of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien lifeform]]s; and hidden maps, all connected with the game. The more expensive game packages had small figurines. These box sets are now extremely rare.
