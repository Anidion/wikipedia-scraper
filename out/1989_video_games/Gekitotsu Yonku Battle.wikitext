{{Nihongo|'''''Gekitotsu Yonku Battle'''''|激突四駆バトル||"Four Wheel Drive Battle Clash"}} is a [[Japan]]-exclusive [[video game]] of the [[vehicular combat game]] genre released in 1989 by [[Irem]] for the [[Family Computer]].

== Game description ==
The game is a top-down game, similar to games such as ''[[Micro Machines]]'', ''[[Moto Roader]]'', ''Jackal'', among others.

Mechanically, the game consists of crashing cars within a limited stage with obstacles in the middle. Occasionally power-ups appear, one of which causes all cars on the screen to explode at the same time.

The goal is to eliminate all enemies and the players can only defeat them by making them crash into the obstacles or by turning around when they are behind the player and crashing into them head-on.
