The song used as the [[Background music#Anime.2C video game and blog music|background music]] is "[[:ja:COME ON EVERYBODY|Come On Everybody]]" from their album ''[[:ja:CAROL 〜A DAY IN A GIRL'S LIFE 1991〜|Carol -A Day In a Girl's Life 1991-]]'' (using the 8-bit sound chip of the Family Computer). The game uses [[Atlus]] NES sound engine by Tsukasa Masuko.

==Story==
[[Image:TMliveinpowerbowlworldwar3.png|thumb|left|A Soviet satellite launches [[nuclear weapon]]s to [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[People's Republic of China|China]] on December 31, 1999.]]

The story starts on [[Ōmisoka|New Year's Eve]] in the year 1999 with the player lounging around in his room generally doing nothing early in the morning. After turning on his computer, he suddenly acquires information that the strategic defense satellite "Colosseum" has picked up some nuclear weapons being fired.<ref name="ameblo">{{cite web | url = http://ameblo.jp/memolmemol/entry-11358331901.html| title = Story/password information |language=Japanese | publisher = Ameblo | date = | accessdate = 2013-03-23}}</ref>

These [[nuclear weapon]]s are being fired at a rapid pace between two forces (presumably the [[United States|Americans]] and the [[Soviet Union|Russians]]). Without knowing it, [[World War III]] is breaking out in front of the player. All the major cities in the world end up getting catastrophically damaged; including [[Paris]], [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] A nuclear blast mysteriously sends the player back to December 22, 1989; with only two days remaining until the official launch of the satellite system.<ref name="ameblo"/>

The nuclear war will not be prevented and civilization will destroy itself unless the player can manage to get the TM Network band to a concert for [[world peace]] even if he has to drive a [[truck]] to get them to their destination.

==Gameplay==
Using his musical influence inspired by [[rock music]], the player must persuade the world to declare global peace so that the nuclear war never happens. Using an interface that is utilized in [[graphic adventure game]]s, the player interacts with the various members of the all-male band and various strangers. These people include the [[security guard]], the [[office lady]], and normal citizens of Japan. While some action components exist in the game, ''Live in Power Bowl: TM Network'' is mostly an adventure game in the vein of the classic [[Time travel in fiction|time travel stories]]. However, the player has to watch how much information they let out. If he tells the wrong person that he is from 1999, then the game ends with him going to [[prison]] and the world is destroyed anyway due to World War III. Japanese literacy is required, as the entire game is in Japanese with only a few words of English spoken.

The game also includes a [[maze]] using [[3D computer graphics]] (although not related to the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] game ''3D Maze'') and mini-games such as [[car chase]]s.

Players can continue their game at any time using a 14-symbol password system consisting of common Japanese characters.<ref name="ameblo"/> They can also memorize [[telephone number]]s from different sources (never actually shown on the screen) to use in an in-game [[telephone directory]]; it is possible to dial these numbers anytime while the game is in session.<ref name="ingamestuff">{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.jp/frnyanko/setsumei/famicom/tmnetwork/tmnetwork.html| title = Basic overview of the in-game system |language=Japanese| publisher = GeoCities.jp| date = | accessdate = 2013-03-23}}</ref>
