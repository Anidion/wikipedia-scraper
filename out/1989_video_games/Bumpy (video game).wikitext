'''''Bumpy''''' is a 1989 [[platform game]] created by [[Loriciels]].<ref name=sc/> It was published for [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]], [[Atari ST]], and [[MS-DOS]].

==Gameplay==
The player controls a ball, collecting items to open the exit.<ref name=rg/> While most platforms are perfectly harmless, some have additional qualities, such as being destructible, thereby granting access to other parts of the screen. Some platforms are on fire, which will turn out lethal unless the player has picked up a water droplet in advance.

==Legacy==
A remake of the game was created in 1992 with the name ''Bumpy's Arcade Fantasy''.

Loriciels wanted a 16-bit game so they handed it over to [[Atari, SA|Infogrames]] who made ''Pop-up'' in 1991. The loading screen and graphics changed but the music sound effects and gameplay remained the same.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The [[Game Boy]] version of ''Pop-up'' was renamed ''Cool Ball'' in the [[United States]].
