{{nihongo foot|'''''Phantasy Star II'''''|ファンタシースターII 還らざる時の終わりに|Phantasy Star II: At the End of the Restoration|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[science fantasy]]  [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Sega Genesis]]. It was released in Japan in 1989, North America in 1990, and in Europe in 1990.<ref name="nadate" /> It was later ported to a variety of different platforms. An updated remake, {{nihongo foot|'''''Phantasy Star Generation 2'''''|ファンタシースター generation:2|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2005 in Japan.

''Phantasy Star II'' is the second installment in Sega's acclaimed ''[[Phantasy Star]]'' series and serves as a sequel to the original ''[[Phantasy Star (video game)|Phantasy Star]]'' for the [[Master System]]. ''Phantasy Star II'' takes place 1,000 years after the events of its predecessor and follows the journey of a government agent named Rolf and his friends, who are on a mission to discover why the protector of the planet Mota, Mother Brain, has started malfunctioning.

''Phantasy Star II'' was the first video game to use a 6 mega-bit cartridge, making it the biggest video game on a console at the time.<ref name="cgw_psii"/> Since its release ''Phantasy Star II'' has been the subject of critical acclaim.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Phantasystar2 top down.jpg|thumb|left|''Phantasy Star II's'' top-down style travel is shown with protagonists Rolf and Nei moving through a town.]]

Gameplay is similar to the original ''[[Phantasy Star (video game)|Phantasy Star]]'', the first game in the series. Its battle system is [[turn-based]] as well as menu-based, allowing the player to choose commands for their party of up to four characters. Each of the eight characters has a different set of preferred weapons and armor, as well as techniques, suited to the character's job. The player must defeat enemies in the [[overworld]] and in dungeons to advance in the game.

The game abandoned the [[First person (video games)|first-person]] view that the first game used for dungeons and battles. ''Phantasy Star II'' instead uses a [[top-down perspective]] for exploration and a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] view in battles.

== Plot ==
Somewhere deep within the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] lies the [[Phantasy Star#Common elements|Algol Star System]]. The parent star, Algol (referred to as "Algo" by this point in the timeline), has three planets orbiting about it. First is Palm ("Palma"), the home of the government. Governors, treasurers, and great thinkers dwell here in great ivory towers, away from the hubbub of everyday life. Next is Mota ("Motavia"), the shining jewel. Once a dry desert planet infested with ant lions, Mota has been transformed into a blue and green tropical paradise. Domed farms grow crops, and the water is regulated into dammed rivers. Life on Mota is sweet, peaceful, and easy. The people have everything they want and do not need to work. Farthest out is Dezo ("Dezoris"), the ice planet. Little is known about this mysterious and dark planet.

One thousand years have passed since Alis and her friends liberated Algo from the evil Lassic in the [[Phantasy Star (video game)|previous game]]; Algo has since prospered under the care of a giant computer called the Mother Brain. The Mother Brain regulates the Climatrol tower which has [[Terraforming|terraformed]] Mota, the biosystems lab, and all other things that provide whatever the people in Mota need.

The game begins with the character Rolf recalling a strange recurring nightmare he has been having. In the dream, a young girl who Rolf does not recognize – but who resembles Alis – is battling a demon. Finally, just before the demon would kill her, Rolf awakens. From his home in Paseo, Mota's capital, Rolf goes to the central tower to meet with the head of government on Mota, in order to receive his newest mission.

The first threat is an increase in dangerous biomonsters (biologically altered animals). Rolf sets off with his companion Nei, a humanoid with catlike features, to investigate, accompanied by six others with each different, but same purpose. Along the way, the group discovers a human-biomonster hybrid named Neifirst, who reveals that Nei's origins are the same as her own. Being part biomonster, she is an outcast from society, causing her to loathe mankind and, because of this, sabotage both Mota's climate control system and the biosystems laboratory. Nei confronts Neifirst and battles her in a one-on-one fight, but is defeated and killed. Anguished, Rolf and the remaining party defeat Neifirst, causing the biosystems laboratory to self-destruct and bringing an end to Mota's Biomonster hazard.

However, this sets another incident in motion: the explosion of the lab damages the Climatrol equipment and causes the central lake, the residential reservoir of Mota, to overflow with water. To prevent a massive flood, Rolf and his friends decide to open up the surrounding four dams. After unlocking the last one, they are captured by Mother Brain's security robots, charged with causing the environmental disaster, and sentenced to death upon the Gaira satellite. However, the satellite malfunctions and collides with Palm, destroying both. Rolf and company are rescued in the nick of time by a space pirate, Tyler.

Now the system's most wanted criminals, blamed for Palm's destruction and the deaths of its people, the group boards Mota's last remaining [[spacecraft]] – legacy of a space program now falling into ruins – to the mysterious and dangerous Dezo. Located at a far corner of the planet is the Esper Mansion: upon reaching it, Rolf awakens the legendary Lutz from a long sleep. Lutz reveals the secrets of Rolf's past, as well as the dark secret of Mother Brain which relates to the fate and destruction Algo is now facing. In order to save the System, the heroes seek to recover the powerful Nei arsenal, found in four hidden dungeons, capable of defeating the enemies on the spaceship Noah, where Mother Brain resides.

It is eventually revealed that the demon from Rolf's original nightmare – Dark Force, Lassic's true corruptor and Alis' enemy a thousand years ago – has corrupted Noah and been behind every threat Rolf has faced, including Mother Brain itself. Rolf confronts the two evil entities and defeats them. After the final battle, Lutz alerts him that there are still people on the ship: they're the remaining survivors from Earth. They reveal they created Mother Brain to satisfy their greedy lifestyle at the expense of Algo's resources, and a fight between the heroes and the earthmen ensues. The game ends with the outcome unrevealed.

== Release ==

=== Localization changes ===
* Lutz, a refugee Esper who lives in the Esper Mansion on Dezo, aids Rolf and friends in their mission. He is supposed to be the same Esper who accompanies Alis in ''Phantasy Star'', but due to the English version of ''Phantasy Star'' naming said Esper "Noah," this point is lost.
* In the Japanese version, Ustvestia, a musician who teaches the characters the Musik technique, is openly gay; when requested to teach a male character the Musik technique, he comments, "He looks cute", and charges less than he would for teaching female characters. Any obvious references to this were removed from the American release; he instead comments, "He looks smart" – and still charges less for teaching the male characters.<ref name="mike">{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Ripplinger|year=2002|title=The Two Phantasy Stars |url=http://www.ripplinger.us/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|publisher=Camineet|access-date=2010-01-29}}</ref>
* While the tracks in the soundtrack are the same for both versions, the snare drums are much louder in the Japanese version.<ref>{{cite web|first=Damian|last=Thomas|year=2008|title=Phantasy Star 1st Series Complete Album|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ps-1st/index.html|publisher=RPGFan|access-date=2010-01-29|archive-date=2013-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522122158/http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ps-1st/index.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* In the Japanese version the game is set 942 years after the events of ''Phantasy Star I''.

''Phantasy Star II'' was a landmark game in its time, "a game of many firsts" according to ''[[Nintendo Power]]''.<ref name="np_psii">{{cite magazine|title=Phantasy Star II|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|year=2009|volume=246–249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94lYAAAAYAAJ&q=phantasy+star+ii|access-date=28 January 2012|page=21|publisher=[[Nintendo of America]]}}</ref> It was the first RPG for the Mega Drive, and was released in the U.S. two months before the original ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' for the NES, another key game in the genre's popularization in North America.

''Phantasy Star II'' is regarded by many as a forerunner for certain aspects of role-playing video games, such as an epic, dramatic, character-driven storyline dealing with serious themes and subject matter, a [[Tactical role-playing game|strategy-based]] battle system,<ref name="gspot_phanstar2">{{cite web|first=Greg |last=Kasavin |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6129293/index.html |title=The Greatest Games of All Time: Phantasy Star II – Features at GameSpot |website=[[GameSpot]] |access-date=2010-09-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050718001919/http://www.gamespot.com/features/6129293/index.html |archive-date=2005-07-18 }}</ref><ref name="cvg_phantasy">{{cite web|title=Time Machine: Phantasy Star|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/281081/features/time-machine-phantasy-star/|publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]|access-date=15 May 2011|date=January 2, 2011}}</ref> and the demand for extensive [[strategy guide]]s for such games (''Phantasy Star II'' included one with the game itself).

=== Remake ===

A [[Video game remake|remake]], ''Phantasy Star Generation 2'', was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 as a part of ''[[Sega Ages]]'' in 2005. Much like ''[[Phantasy Star (video game)#Remake|Phantasy Star Generation 1]]'', the remake mirrors the events of the original game while adding [[character arc|character development]] and fleshing out the story in more detail.  It featured enhanced graphics, a revised combat system, and a rearranged soundtrack. Other new features included the ability to play the original Mega Drive version, and to load a system file from ''Phantasy Star Generation:1'' to allow the ability to play as Nei throughout the entire game.

It was originally slated for North American and European release by [[Conspiracy Entertainment]] as a part of the ''Phantasy Star Trilogy'', a compilation of the remakes of ''Phantasy Star'', ''Phantasy Star II'', and ''Phantasy Star IV''. The compilation's future is uncertain, however, since [[Sega]] reclaimed the publishing rights for North America and Europe. This is evidenced by the fact that the trilogy no longer appears on Conspiracy Entertainment's list of products on their website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conspiracygames.com/products.php |title=Conspiracy Entertainment's current product list |publisher=Conspiracygames.com |access-date=2009-10-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124230506/http://www.conspiracygames.com/products.php |archive-date=2005-11-24 }}</ref> Sega has abandoned their plans for a ''Phantasy Star IV'' remake in favor of a compilation featuring the original iterations of ''Phantasy Star I''–''IV''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/objects/686/686588.html |title=IGN.com entry on Phantasy Star Trilogy indicating its cancellation |publisher=Ps2.ign.com |date=2004-05-27 |access-date=2009-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/segaagesphantasystartrilogy/tech_info.html |title=Gamespot entry on Phantasy Star Trilogy indicating its cancellation |publisher=Gamespot.com |access-date=2009-10-23}}</ref>

Game designer [[Yasushi Yamaguchi]], who was responsible for the 'Mechanical Design' in the game, expressed interest for a 3D remake.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/01/phantasy-star-ii-designer-would-love-to-do-a-genshin-impact-style-3d-remake |title=Phantasy Star II Designer Would Love To Do A Genshin Impact-Style 3D Remake |publisher=timeextension.com |access-date=2024-01-08}}</ref>
