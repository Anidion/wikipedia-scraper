In ''Gang Wars'', up to two players can control two different characters with different fighting styles. The movements are composed of two attack types—punch and kick—to fight against enemies, plus jumping to overcome obstacles. Players have access to a repertoire of techniques by pushing these buttons individually or in combination. The characters can also pick up weapons for hitting, throwing projectiles and firearms. At the end of each stage the players can customise the characters' three fighting statistics (Power, Speed and Guard) depending on the number of points they have. Higher-end stage scores grant more customisation points.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Gang Wars'' on their July 15, 1989, issue as being the third-most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles like ''[[Golden Axe (video game)|Golden Axe]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=360|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 July 1989|page=33|lang=ja}}</ref>
