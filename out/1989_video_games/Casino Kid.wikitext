'''''Casino Kid''''' is a [[Casino game|casino]] video game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] released in 1989. It was developed and published by [[Sofel]]. In Japan, the game was released as {{nihongo|'''''$1,000,000 Kid: Maboroshi no Teiou Hen'''''|100万＄キッド 幻の帝王編}} and is based on the [[manga]] series ''$1,000,000 Kid'' by Yuki Ishigaki.

==Gameplay==
''Casino Kid'' takes place in a fictional Las Vegas (the Japanese version uses the actual city of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]) where the object is to earn much money and to defeat the evil King of the Casino. Games at the casino include [[blackjack]] and five-card draw [[poker]]. [[Slot machine]]s and [[roulette]] were omitted from the North American version. While the North American version uses a parody name for the Las Vegas casino, the Japanese version uses the actual ''[[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]]'' name.

In the Japanese version, it is possible to travel to other casinos like New York City and Japan for a substantial [[airfare]] cost. Players can essentially customize the game in the Japanese version by placing in their own name. Casino Kid has blue hair in the Japanese version and blond hair in the North American version.  A "free mode" is added into the Japanese version that allow for experimentation with gambling strategies.<ref name="uvlist">[http://www.uvlist.net/fr/game-7641-Casino+Kid Basic information about ''Casino Kid''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229101200/http://www.uvlist.net/fr/game-7641-Casino+Kid |date=2016-12-29 }} at UV List {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

''Casino Kid II'' is the sequel to ''Casino Kid'', released in North America in April 1993 by the same company. The sequel was originally going to be titled ''The Prince of Othello'' and given a 1990 release until Sofel decided to temporarily cancel the project.

In ''Casino Kid II'', the titular protagonist, after having defeated the top players in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], is issued a challenge by the top gamblers around the world. The matches are organized by a mysterious leader, and to unveil the leader, the Casino Kid must defeat nine opponents from around the world in the games of [[roulette]], [[poker]], and [[blackjack]]. There is a story sequence that is more elaborate than in ''Casino Kid''. Gameplay in ''Casino Kid II'' differs in that players no longer venture around the casino looking for rival gamblers, though the card games still operate in the same fashion as in the original ''Casino Kid''. Players travel by plane to each destination either in the daytime or in the night; depending on which country that he is flying to.

Unlike ''Casino Kid'', ''Casino Kid II'' was never released in Japan. The game is probably most well known for its music done by the [[EIM (video game developer)|EIM]] sound team of [[Kenji Eno]] and Michiya Hirasawa (both now deceased).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=File:Casino_Kid_II_-_NES_-_Credits.png|title = File:Casino Kid II - NES - Credits.PNG - Video Game Music Preservation Foundation Wiki}}</ref>
