Follows the base ruleset of beach volleyball. Two teams of two players each trying to score by making the ball land inside the opponents half of the court. First team reaching seven points within six minutes wins and head to another of the eight countries. At five minutes of play, the music changes to a different tune to indicate the player to hurry up. If the player reach the six minutes limit, the player lose the game, even if the player are ahead in points. One or two player at once can play the game, but tournament mode is only available for single player. In singe player mode the player will be joined by an AI controlled player. To help the human player a flickering blue cursor on the ground will indicate where the ball will be landing.

The world tournament consists of a single match in eight different countries, which is seen on a world map. The team starts in [[London]] and the final match will be held in [[Paris]]. The team had to take challenges in [[New York City]], [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[Luxor]], [[Sydney]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Moscow]] in between too. Every hosting country will be introduced with a little humorous skit, which is usually related to their sights or locations.
