==Plot==
''Dr. Plummet's House of Flux'' is a game in which the unusual Dr. Plummet has invited the player character to come to his House of Flux for a test of skills involving four different missions. Each mission has seven levels with a specific theme that determines the backgrounds and obstacles for each level. The player flies a ship with a gun and shield to save six captive astronauts from each level, avoiding or destroying obstacles placed by Dr. Plummet.<ref name="Dragon157"/>

==Gameplay==
The player operates the ship using a joystick. Moving the joystick to the left or right rotates the ship in a counter-clockwise or clockwise direction. Pushing forward on the joystick thrusts the ship forward. Pressing the joystick button fires the guns, and the space bar raises shields that protect the ship from some obstacles and enemy fire. Running out of fuel causes the ship to rotate aimlessly.<ref name="Dragon157"/>
