'''''Blood Money''''' is a [[side-scrolling shooter]] video game developed by [[DMA Design]] and published by [[Psygnosis]] in 1989 for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[MS-DOS]]. A [[Commodore 64]] version followed in 1990. The game is set in four different locations on a planet, where the player must fight off enemies and [[video game boss|bosses]].

The game began development immediately after ''[[Menace (video game)|Menace]]'', and borrowed similar gameplay elements. The development team used advanced hardware to develop ''Blood Money'', using improved graphical and technological processes. The game was inspired by the presentation of ''[[Mr. Heli]]'', and the animations of ''Blood Money'' would later inspire the development of ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]''. The game was released to positive reviews; praise was given to the game's graphics and gameplay. The game was commercially successful, selling over 40,000 copies.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:Blood Money gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The player's ship (left) shooting at two large enemies.]]

''Blood Money'' is a 2D [[side-scrolling shooter]]. The player moves through four stages on the planet, taking control of a different vehicle in each level: a helicopter in the metal world, a submarine in a water world, a spacesuit in an ice world, and a fighter jet in a fire world. Each vehicle features unique weaponry, which the player uses to attack all advancing enemies. The player can upgrade their vehicle with [[power-up]]s, which grant them additional weapons and upgrades, such as support missiles and neutron bombs.<ref name="CVG Review"/>

The vehicles' energy acts as the player's [[Health (gaming)|health]], and is depleted when the vehicle makes contact with enemies and walls. When all energy is lost, the player lose a life; three lives are provided at the beginning of the game, and additional lives can be bought in a shop at certain points in the levels. Money for the shop can be collected when destroying enemies. When all three lives are lost, [[Game over|the game ends]] and the player are sent to a score result screen.<ref name="Emulator"/> The first two levels may be selected from the beginning of the game; after one level is complete, the player can select any remaining world without restrictions. At the end of each level, the player must defeat a [[Boss (video game)|boss]].<ref name="CVG Review"/>

== Development ==
Following the successful release of ''[[Menace (video game)|Menace]]'' in 1988, [[David Jones (video game developer)|David Jones]] began developing ''Blood Money'' on 4 January 1989, on the 25&nbsp;MHz 386-DX computer that publisher [[Psygnosis]] granted him, alongside a [[Intel system development kit|personal development system]].<ref name="History 2.1"/> Jones saw ''Blood Money'' as a continuation of the concept used in ''Menace''.<ref>{{citation |title=Blood Money ''Instruction Booklet'' |editor=DMA Design |editor-link=DMA Design |publisher=[[Psygnosis]] |location=[[Liverpool]] |year=1989 |page=12 |url=http://gamesdbase.com/Media/SYSTEM/Commodore_Amiga//Manual/formated/Blood_Money_-_1989_-_Psygnosis_Limited.htm |access-date=5 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007133854/http://gamesdbase.com/Media/SYSTEM/Commodore_Amiga//Manual/formated/Blood_Money_-_1989_-_Psygnosis_Limited.htm |archive-date=7 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Jones was heavily inspired by the "cuteness" of ''[[Mr. Heli]]'' (1987) during the development of ''Blood Money''.<ref name="History 2.1"/> The game's cover art was designed by British artist [[Peter Andrew Jones]] for the novel ''[[Protector (novel)|Protector]]'' (1973) by [[Larry Niven]], and was adapted for the game's cover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peterandrewjones.net/paintings_science_fiction/swa150.htm |title=Protector |last=Jones |first=Peter Andrew |author-link=Peter Andrew Jones |publisher=[[Peter Andrew Jones]] |access-date=5 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084358/http://www.peterandrewjones.net/paintings_science_fiction/swa150.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

With ''Blood Money'', Jones was determined to use the full colour range of the [[Amiga]], opting to use the [[blitter]] as opposed to the hardware scrolling; the blitter allowed graphics to be drawn quickly. Tony Smith, who had worked on ''Menace'', produced the graphics for ''Blood Money'', while Jones began work on a new scrolling system. While developing his own game, ''Talisman'', [[Mike Dailly (game designer)|Mike Dailly]] created a compact method to move enemies on-screen, which Jones incorporated into ''Blood Money''.<ref name="History 2.1"/> The game's animations fascinated Jones' friend Gary Timmons, who then began experimenting with [[Deluxe Paint]]; his work on the program led to his employment at DMA Design, and inspired some of the animations used in DMA's next game, ''[[Walker (video game)|Walker]]'' (1993).<ref name="History 2.4"/> The game's introduction required a star field, which Jones took from a quick demonstration that Dailly had been working on.<ref name="History 2.3"/>

The game was ported to the PC by Tim Ansell of [[Creative Assembly]],<ref name="PC port"/> and to [[Atari ST]] by Jones' friend Wayne Smithson,<ref name="History 3.2"/> while Dailly began porting the game to the [[Commodore 64]] following the [[Personal Computer World]] Show in September 1989.<ref name="History 2.4"/> Dailly used the code from the ''Talisman'' [[Technology demonstration|demo]], and wrote a new [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] system. He also re-worked the multi-directional scrolling,<ref name="History 2.5"/> and wrote his own tape loading routines, wanting one that allowed the player to play a simple game while ''Blood Money'' loaded.<ref name="History 3.1"/> Smith designed the graphics for the port, and became confused by the limitations of the hardware: he had to draw double pixels in Deluxe Paint, and was limited to sixteen colours.<ref name="History 2.5"/> Dailly finished developing the Commodore 64 version of ''Blood Money'' on 12 March 1990.<ref name="History 3.2"/> Video game musician Matt Furniss claimed that a conversion for the [[Sega Mega Drive]] was once in development with its music complete.<ref name="Sega-16a1">{{cite web|last=Furniss|first=Matt|url=https://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?8418-Shadow-of-the-Beast&p=220028&viewfull=1#post220028|title=Shadow of the Beast|work=Sega-16|publisher=[[vBulletin]]|date=8 February 2010|page=2|access-date=2020-12-04|archive-date=2014-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804094703/http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?8418-Shadow-of-the-Beast&p=220028&viewfull=1#post220028|url-status=live}}</ref>
