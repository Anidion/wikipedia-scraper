==Gameplay==
[[File:Crack Down.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]
Using a top-down perspective (akin to ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]''), the player controls either Ben or Andy, a pair of agents charged with stopping [[mad scientist]] Mr. X (Mr.K in the ''[[Sega Mega Drive]]'' version) from [[Hegemony|taking over the world]], as they make their way through several timed levels, planting bombs and destroying [[cyborg]] enemies using guns (the "machine gun" and the "cannon" can be swapped back and forth) and smart bombs (which wipe out all enemies on screen.)  The goal of each stage is to plant all of the bombs and escape before their collective timer goes off.
