'''''Rock 'n' Roll''''' is a [[video game]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[MS-DOS]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[Amstrad CPC]], published by [[Rainbow Arts]] in 1989. The idea for the game and the programming are by Frank Prasse.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} The Soundtrack for the Amiga version was composed by Chris Huelsbeck.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The titles comes from both the aspect of rolling the ball along the level, and the various [[Rock and roll]]-inspired tunes that play during gameplay.

==Gameplay==
''Rock 'n' Roll'' is an action-oriented [[puzzle game]] with 32 levels (plus a secret bonus level). The player controls a [[ball]] (steered with the [[computer mouse|mouse]] on the Amiga or the [[joystick]] on the Commodore 64) and his job is to reach the exit on each level.

Numerous objects help or hinder the player's path to the exit. These include locked doors that he needs to find a key to, [[ice]] which hinders his steering, [[fan (implement)|fans]] that push him away or [[magnet]]s that pull him towards them, crumbling floor tiles, and others. A [[map]] of the level is accessible at any time, but it starts out completely blank. The player has to collect [[eye]]s along the level to make various objects visible on the map.
He may also buy various supplies like a fastball, a spikeball, bombs, and even hints for game secrets like extra money, extra lives and short cuts.
