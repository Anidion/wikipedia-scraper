'''''Pro Tennis Tour''''' (known in Germany and France as '''''Great Courts'''''<ref name="ASM"/><ref name="ACE"/>) is a 1989 [[sports video game]] developed by [[Blue Byte]] and published by [[Ubi Soft]] for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[MS-DOS]]. [[8-bit]] ports for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] were released later. [[Electronic Arts]] distributed the game in North America.<ref name="amigaworld"/> A sequel, ''[[Pro Tennis Tour 2]]'', was released in 1991.

==Gameplay==
The game offers a pseudo three-dimensional view of the court. The joystick or keyboard controls the movement. Shots are played by pressing the fire button and releasing it to hit the ball. Positioning is important, since the player character can't be moved while swinging. A crosshair appears on the ground when the opponent hits the ball, to mark where to hit the ball. The crosshair can be switched off in higher [[Difficulty level|difficulties]].  Tournament play is the main part of the game. The player begins ranked 64th and plays computer-controlled opponents in succession. Tournaments have different surfaces: grass at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], clay at the [[French Open]], cement at the [[Australian Open]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. In practice mode, skills can be worked on against computer-controlled opponents or the ball machine. In two-player mode, the foreground views are alternated between the players after a round is over.<ref name="ACE"/><ref name="amigaworld"/>

''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' said "What really makes this particular tennis simulation stand out is attention to detail." and "This is easily the best tennis simulation to date [...]"<ref name="ACE"/> ''[[Zzap!64]]'' noted that "[t]he difficulty of hitting the ball is disconcerting at first, but once mastered the novel hitting technique works really well." The game was summarized as "[u]ndoubtedly the best tennis sim yet."<ref name="Z64-1"/> ''Zzap!64'' also reviewed the Commodore 64 port: "This is a really good conversion [...], retaining the Amiga game's simple playability and featuring some very good, large player sprites. The game plays almost identically to the original with a high speed of play that makes hitting the ball a difficult task at first."<ref name="Z64-2"/> ''[[Amiga World]]'' concluded: "While its graphics are gorgeous and the sound very life-like, Pro Tennis Tour is below the usual quality of the Electronic Arts sports line. Sit out this match."<ref name="amigaworld">{{cite magazine |last1=Teverbaugh |first1=Rick |title=Game Preserve - Pro Tennis Tour |journal=[[Amiga World]] |date=April 1990 |issue=43 |pages=74–76 |url=https://archive.org/details/amiga-world-1990-04/page/n75/mode/2up |publisher=[[IDG Publishing]]}}</ref> ''{{ill|Amstar (magazine)|lt=Amstar Informatique|fr}}'' called the game "a must have".<ref name="amstar"/> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' called the game "The best tennis sim on the Speccy so far."<ref name="yoursinclair"/>
