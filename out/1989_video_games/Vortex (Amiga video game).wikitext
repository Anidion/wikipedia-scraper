Juris Graney for the ''Australian Commodore and Amiga Review said'' "Overall the game is great. Sound effects and music are tastefully done and the graphics are excellent. If you, like me, are getting a little tired of the continuous line of look-alike punch-em-ups and shoot-em-ups that are being paraded to us, then Vortex may be just what you are looking for"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Australian_Commodore_and_Amiga_Review_The_Volume_7_Issue_8_1990-08_Saturday_Magazine_AU/page/n72/mode/1up|title=Vortex|magazine=Australian Commodore and Amiga Review|page=73|date=August 1990|accessdate=November 12, 2022}}</ref>
