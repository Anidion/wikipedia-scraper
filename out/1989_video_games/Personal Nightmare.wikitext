==Plot==
The game focuses on a town where The Devil has invaded and the [[Player character|player]] has four days to eliminate all possessed citizens (led by a [[witch]] and a [[vampire]]) and finally purge the evil by defeating the Devil himself before he can take over.

==Gameplay==
The game makes use of a combination of text-based commands, clickable verbal commands and clickable objects to progress. A compass indicates which directions the player can travel. Much of the game's movement and actions are [[Real-time game|real-time]] based so there is a day and night cycle. The player's [[Item (game terminology)#In adventure games|inventory]] can be viewed in the respective menu. There are many encounters that can kill the player (ideally at night time) unless the player performs a proper action to avoid them. Newer versions of the game omitted the encounters where the players gets garroted. The player [[Game over|loses the game]] if four days pass and all the required possessed citizens have not been killed and the devil has not been repelled.
