{{Nihongo foot|'''''Mother''''',|マザー|Mazā|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} officially known outside of Japan as '''''EarthBound Beginnings''''', is a 1989 [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Creatures (company)|Ape Inc.]] and Pax Softnica<ref>{{Cite web |title=ソフトニカ |url=http://www.softnica.com/ |access-date=March 2, 2022 |website=www.softnica.com |archive-date=April 18, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220418193529/http://www.softnica.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Family Computer]]. It is the first entry in the [[Mother (video game series)|''Mother'']] series. It is modeled on the gameplay of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series, but is set in the late 20th-century United States, unlike its [[fantasy]] genre contemporaries. ''Mother'' follows a young boy named Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on [[psionics|psychic powers]] to put an end to the [[paranormal]] phenomena that has recently spiraled the country into disarray. The game uses [[random encounter]]s to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system.

Writer and director [[Shigesato Itoi]] pitched ''Mother''{{'}}s concept to [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. A North American version of the game was [[game localization|localized]] into English, but was eventually abandoned as being commercially nonviable. A copy of this prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal title ''EarthBound Zero''. The game was eventually released globally as ''EarthBound Beginnings'' for the [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] in June 2015 and [[Nintendo Switch Online]] in February 2022.

''Mother'' was the sixth best-selling [[1989 in video games|game of 1989]] in Japan, where it sold about 400,000 copies and received a "Silver Hall of Fame" score from ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine. ''Mother'' was praised for its similarities to the ''Dragon Quest'' series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, but many have considered its sequel ''[[EarthBound|Mother 2: Gīgu no Gyakushū]]'' (known outside of Japan as ''[[EarthBound]]'') to be similar and a overall better implementation of ''Mother''{{'s}} gameplay ideas. The game's high [[difficulty level]] polarized critics, along with [[Balance (game design)|balance]] issues. Jeremy Parish of ''[[1UP.com]]'' wrote that ''Mother'' importantly generated interest in [[video game emulation]] and the historical preservation of unreleased games. The game was re-released in Japan on the single-cartridge [[Product bundling|compilation]] ''[[Mother 1+2]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2003.

''Mother'' is a [[single-player]], [[role-playing video game]]<ref name="nlife: profile"/> set in a "slightly offbeat", late 20th-century United States as interpreted by Japanese author [[Shigesato Itoi]].<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/> The game deliberately avoids traits of its Japanese role-playing game contemporaries: it is not set within the [[fantasy genre]] and only enters science fiction for its final sequence.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/> The player fights in warehouses and laboratories instead of in standard dungeons. Instead of swords, assault weapons, and magic, the player uses baseball bats, [[toy guns]], and [[psionics|psychic abilities]]. The game's protagonist, Ninten, is about 12 years old.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/>

Like the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series, ''Mother'' uses a [[random encounter]] combat system. The player explores the [[overworld]] from a top-down perspective and occasionally enters a first-person perspective battle sequence where the player chooses attack options from a series of menus.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/> On their turn, the player selects between options to fight, guard, check enemy [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]], run away, use items, or use offensive, defensive, or healing psychic powers. The player can also set the battle on autopilot with the "auto" option.<ref name="RPGamer: review"/> [[Critical hit]]s register with the series' signature "SMAAAASH" text and sound.<ref name="RPGamer: review"/>

The player can press a button to have Ninten "check" or "talk" with nearby people, animals, and objects. The game shares similarities with its sequel, ''[[EarthBound]]'': there is a [[game save]] option through using a phone to call Ninten's father, an option to store items with Ninten's sister at home, and an [[automated teller machine]] for banking money (ATM). The members of Ninten's party are all visible on the overworld screen at once, and are analogous to ''EarthBound''{{'s}} party members in style and function. ''Mother''{{'s}} [[world map]] does not keep locations separate, and instead connects all areas (akin to the [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'']] game series). The game's story begins as Ninten discovers a [[music box]] and receives the journal of his great-grandfather, who studied psychic powers nearly a century earlier. Ninten is attacked by household items, and ventures outside to find a crazy world with hostile everyday objects and other odd events.<ref name="RPGamer: review"/>

== Plot ==
{{Redirect-distinguish|Ninten|Nintendo}}
<!-- ATTENTION: Please use the 1989 Famicom version's plot for this section rather than that of the 1990 localization; additionally, while the game's plot is mostly non-linear, this section will rely on what is generally regarded as the "canon" route.-->
''Mother'' begins with the story of a young, married, American couple who mysteriously vanish from their small, rural town. Two years later, the husband, George, returned as mysteriously as he vanished, and began a strange study in complete seclusion. His wife, Maria, was never heard from again. Years later, in 1988 (changed to an ambiguous point in the 1980s in later releases), a young American boy named Ninten is attacked at home in a [[paranormal]] event. His father explains that Ninten's great-grandfather studied psychic powers, and asks Ninten to investigate a crisis occurring across the world, later revealed to be the work of an invading alien race. After resolving crises in the town of Mother's Day (Podunk in later translations), Ninten is warped to the world of Magicant, where the land's ruler, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to rediscover a song that appears in her dreams by collecting the parts and playing them for her. Ninten returns to Earth and befriends a young boy, Lloyd (also called Roid or Loid in other translations), who is being bullied at Twinkle [[Elementary school]]. The two travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to Ana, a young girl with psychic powers. Ana tells Ninten she saw him in a vision, and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother.

[[File:Mother overworld screenshot.png|thumb|left|Ninten and party exploring the overworld]]<!-- ATTENTION: Please do NOT change the any of the names without discussion on the talk page.-->

After finding multiple parts of Queen Mary's song, Ninten is harassed at a [[karaoke bar]] by Teddy, the leader of a local gang. Teddy surrenders after battling Ninten in a fistfight, and joins Ninten's party with the intent to avenge the deaths of his parents, who were killed at Holy Loly Mountain (Mt. Itoi in later versions). Lloyd stays behind. In a cottage at the base of Holy Loly Mountain, Ana pulls Ninten aside and asks him to always be by her side. The two dance and profess their mutual love. Soon after, Teddy warns the party of a strange noise, and a giant robot attacks Ninten and his friends. Lloyd arrives with a tank and destroys the robot, but accidentally hits the party and critically wounds Teddy, so Lloyd re-joins the party. They take a boat out on Holy Loly Lake and a whirlpool pulls them into an underwater laboratory, where they find a robot who claims to have been built by George to protect Ninten. When the laboratory floods, they leave for the mountain's peak and the robot helps them ascend. Another robot (implied to be an upgraded version of the one fought at the cabin) attacks them at the summit, and George's robot self-destructs to destroy it, leaving behind the seventh part of Queen Mary's song. After learning this melody, the party travels back to Magicant, where Ninten sings the melodies he had learned to Queen Mary. She recalls the rest of the song, thus teaching Ninten the eighth and final melody in the process, and reminisces about an alien named [[Giygas]] that she loved as her own child. Queen Mary reveals that she is George's wife, Maria, and vanishes. Magicant, revealed to be a mirage created by her consciousness, vanishes with her. In later translations of the game, Ninten first visits George's grave at the top of Holy Loly Mountain, where George's spirit teaches Ninten the final melody.

The party is warped back to the top of Holy Loly Mountain. Large rocks block the entrance to a cave inside Holy Loly Mountain, but are cleared by the power of Maria's consciousness. In that cave, they find an area with human prisoners including Ana's mother. They need to defeat the [[mother ship|Mother Ship]] to free the prisoners. The party encounters the ship that the fully-grown Giygas is on. The alien expresses its gratefulness to Ninten's family for raising it, but explains that George stole vital information from its people that could have been used to betray them, and proceeds to accuse Ninten of interfering with their plans. Giygas offers to save Ninten alone if he boards the Mother Ship, only for Ninten to decline, leading Giygas to attack Ninten's party. The party begins to sing Queen Mary's lullaby while Giygas tries to quiet the party through his attacks. However, the party persists and finishes the lullaby, causing Giygas to become overwhelmed with emotion at the thought of Maria's motherly love. Giygas swears that they will meet again and flies off in the mother ship.

In the original Family Computer release, the game then ends with Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd facing the player as the [[credits roll]] behind them. Later releases feature an extended ending with the kids returning home and reuniting with their families. Teddy recovers from his injuries and becomes a singer, Lloyd is now treated like a hero among his classmates and Ana is shown receiving a letter from Ninten. Ninten goes to bed as the cast of characters appear at the bottom of the screen before the credits. After the credits, the game freezes on an image of a man, presumably Ninten's father, trying to call his son, stating, "I know that boy is home. Come on son and answer the phone. Something new has come up and . . ."

''Mother'' was developed by [[Creatures (company)|Ape]] and Pax Softnica and published by [[Nintendo]].<ref name="nlife: profile"/> While visiting Nintendo for other work, copywriter [[Shigesato Itoi]] pitched his idea for a role-playing game set in contemporary times to the company's [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. He thought the setting would be unique for its incongruence with role-playing genre norms, as daily life lacked the pretense for [[magic (gaming)|magic powers]] and they could not simply give the child characters firearms as weapons. Itoi's project proposal suggested how the natural limitations could be circumvented. Miyamoto met with him and praised the idea, though he was not sure whether Itoi "could pull it off".<ref name="1101: cancel"/> As an advertiser, Itoi was used to concept proposals preceding the staffing process, but Miyamoto explained that video game concepts needed people who signed on to "make" the product.<ref name="1101: cancel"/> Itoi was overcome with "powerlessness".<ref name="1101: cancel"/>{{efn|Itoi later described this moment as the "one time [Miyamoto] made [him] cry".<ref name="1101: cancel"/>}}

Miyamoto was also hesitant to work with Itoi at a time when companies were pushing major celebrity product endorsements, as Itoi's involvement would be for such a game. When the two met next, Miyamoto brought the documentation from a text adventure game and told Itoi that he would have to write similar documentation himself. Miyamoto said that he knew from his own experience that the game would only be as good as the effort Itoi invested, and that he knew Itoi could not invest the appropriate time with his full-time job. Itoi restated his interest and reduced his workload, so Miyamoto assembled a development team. Upon assessing for compatibility, they began production in [[Ichikawa, Chiba]]. Itoi had said earlier that he wanted his work environment to feel like an extracurricular club consisting of volunteers and working out of an apartment, which Miyamoto tried to accommodate.<ref name="1101: cancel"/> Itoi wrote the game's script<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/> and commuted from [[Tokyo]], a process he found "exhausting".<ref name="1101: cancel"/> Even with asking Itoi to prioritize the development process, Miyamoto received criticism of acquiescing to celebrity and of hiring a copywriter not up for the task. Miyamoto said that his decision to pursue the project was based on his confidence in Itoi.<ref name="1101: cancel"/> According to Itoi in a 1989 ''[[Famitsu]]'' interview, the word "mothership" was the influence for the game's title, although he states the title had other meanings too.<ref>@johntv - [https://twitter.com/johntv/status/1132552371790213121/photo/1 "I always assumed 'MOTHER' (Japanese title for the ''Earthbound'' series) came from 'Mother Earth', but according to Shigesato Itoi in a 1989 interview with Famitsu, the primary influence was the word 'mothership'".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220425013817/https://twitter.com/johntv/status/1132552371790213121/photo/1 |date=April 25, 2022 }} - via [[Twitter]]</ref>{{better source needed|date=January 2021}} ''Mother'' was released in Japan on July 27, 1989, for the [[Famicom]]<ref name=Famitsu/> (known as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] outside Japan).<ref name="nlife: profile"/>

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of the EarthBound series#Mother}}
The game's soundtrack was composed by [[Keiichi Suzuki (composer)|Keiichi Suzuki]] and [[Hirokazu Tanaka]]. Tanaka was a video game composer working for Nintendo who had previously composed for games such as ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'', while Suzuki was a composer and musician for bands of many different genres.<ref name="Suzukidisc">{{cite web|url=http://www.keiichisuzuki.com/profile/ |title=Keiichi Suzuki – Profile|last=Suzuki|first=Keichi|publisher=keiichisuzuki.com|access-date=October 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190820/http://keiichisuzuki.com/profile/ |archive-date=November 13, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> The NES was only able to play three notes at a time, which Suzuki has noted greatly limited what he was able to produce, as he could not create some of the sounds he wanted.<ref name="FAMITSUSUZUKIint">{{cite journal | title = Interview with Keiichi Suzuki | journal = [[Weekly Famitsu]] | publisher = [[Enterbrain, Inc.]] | date = October 28, 1994 | pages = 12 | language = ja}}</ref>

An eleven-track album of songs inspired by the game's soundtrack was recorded in Tokyo, London, and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and released by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|CBS/Sony Records]] on August 21, 1989. The album contained mostly vocal arrangements in English and was likened by ''RPGFan'' reviewer Patrick Gann to compositions by [[the Beatles]] and for [[children's television shows]]. He found the lyrics "cheesy and trite" but appreciated the "simple statements" in "Eight Melodies" and the "quirky and wonderful" "Magicant". Only the last song on the album is in [[chiptune]]. Gann ultimately recommended the 2004 remastered release over this version.<ref name="RPGFan: album"/> The game's soundtrack contains several tracks later used in subsequent series games.<ref name="RPGamer: review"/>

==== Critical Response ====
Reviewers noted the game's similarities with the ''Dragon Quest'' series and its simultaneous "parody" of the genre's tropes.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/><ref name="RPGamer: review"/> They thought the game's sequel, ''EarthBound'', to be very similar<ref name="RPGamer: review"/><ref name="1UP: hall of fame"/> and a better implementation of ''Mother''{{'s}} gameplay ideas.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/> Critics also disliked the game's high [[difficulty level]] and [[Balance (game design)|balance]] issues.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/><ref name="RPGamer: review"/><ref name="1UP: hall of fame"/><ref name="Polygon: pretty cart"/>

Jeremy Parish of ''USgamer'' described the game as a mild-mannered parody ("between satire and pastiche") of the role-playing game genre, specifically the ''Dragon Quest'' series.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/> He noted that ''Mother'', like many Japanese role-playing games, emulated the ''Dragon Quest'' style: the windowed interface, first-person perspective in combat, and graphics, but differed in its contemporary setting and non-fantasy story. Parish commented that [[Atlus]]'s 1987 ''[[Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei]]'' was similarly set in the modern day, though it devolved into science fiction and fantasy in ways ''Mother'' did not. He added that the game has "a sense of wonder and magic realism ... in the context of childhood imagination", as Ninten can feel more like someone "pretending" to be a ''Dragon Quest''-style hero than a hero in his own right.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/>{{efn|Parish added that later games such as ''[[Costume Quest]]'' and ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' picked up on this theme.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/>|name=|group=}} Parish said this makes the player wonder which game events are real and which are Ninten's imagination. Parish cited Itoi's interest in entering the games industry to make a "satirical" role-playing game as proof of the genre's swift five-year rise to widespread popularity in Japan.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/>

Cassandra Ramos of ''RPGamer'' praised the game's graphics and music, and considered it among the console's best, with "rich, ... nicely detailed" visuals, ''[[Peanuts]]''-style characters, and "simple but effective" audio.<ref name="RPGamer: review"/> In contrast, she found the battle sequences aesthetically "pretty bland" and, otherwise, the game's "least interesting" aspect.<ref name="RPGamer: review"/> Overall, she found ''Mother'' "surprisingly complex ... for its time", and considered its story superior to (but less "wacky" than) its sequel.<ref name="RPGamer: review"/> She especially recommended the game for ''EarthBound'' fans.<ref name="RPGamer: review"/>

Parish credited Itoi for the game's vision and compared his ability and literary interests with American author [[Garrison Keillor]]. Parish felt that Itoi's pedigree as a writer and copywriter was well suited for the space-limited, [[8-bit era|8-bit]] role-playing game medium, which privileged ''Mother'' ahead of other games written by non-writers. ''USgamer''{{'s}} Parish noted how the game's [[non-player characters]] would "contemplate the profound and trivial" instead of reciting the active plot.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/> He added that the game's lack of an official North American release has bolstered the reputation and revere of its immediate sequel.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/>

While Parish said ''Mother''{{'s}} script was "as sharp as ''EarthBound''{{'s}}", he felt that the original's game mechanics did not meet the same level of quality. ''Mother'' lacked the "rolling [[health (gaming)|HP]] counter" and non-random encounters for which later entries in the series were known. Parish also found the game's balance to be uneven, as the [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistical character attributes]] and level of difficulty scaled incorrectly with the game's progression.<ref name="USgamer: Skewered"/> Rose Colored Gaming, a company that made custom reproductions of the NES cartridge, noted that the Japanese release's was more challenging than the unreleased English localization.<ref name="Polygon: pretty cart"/> ''RPGamer''{{'s}} Ramos similarly found balance issues, with a high number of battles, difficult enemies, reliance on [[grinding (video gaming)|grinding]], and some oversized levels.<ref name="RPGamer: review"/> Parish wrote earlier for ''[[1UP.com]]'' that in comparison to ''EarthBound'', ''Mother'' is "worse in just about every way", a [[video game clone|clone]] where its sequel was "a satirical deconstruction of RPGs".<ref name="1UP: hall of fame"/> He wrote that the game's historical significance is not for its actual game but for the interest it generated in [[Video game console emulator|video game emulation]] and the preservation of unreleased games.<ref name="1UP: hall of fame"/>

== Legacy ==

''Mother'' was rereleased in Japan as the single-cartridge ''[[Mother 1+2]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2003. This version uses the extended ending of the unreleased English prototype, but is only presented in Japanese.<ref name="RPGamer: review"/> [[Starmen.net]] hosted a ''Mother'' 25th Anniversary Fanfest in 2014 with a [[livestream]] of the game and plans for a remixed soundtrack.<ref name="nlife: 25th"/> Later that year, fans released a 25th Anniversary Edition [[ROM hack]] that updated the game's graphics, script, and gameplay balance.<ref name="EC: ROM hack"/>

A film group known as 54&O Productions developed a fan-made documentary entitled ''Mother to Earth''. The documentary focused on the road to ''Mother'''s localization in North America, and includes interviews with key people behind the process.<ref name="NLcitesMOEcampaign">{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/04/campaign_seeks_to_spin_the_tale_behind_earthbound_beginnings |title=Campaign Seeks to Spin the Tale Behind EarthBound Beginnings |first=Tim |last=Latshaw |website=[[Nintendo Life]] |date=April 20, 2016 |access-date=October 20, 2016 |archive-date=October 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020172735/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/04/campaign_seeks_to_spin_the_tale_behind_earthbound_beginnings |url-status=live }}</ref>
