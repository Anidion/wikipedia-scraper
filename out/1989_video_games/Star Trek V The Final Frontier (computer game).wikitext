==Reception==
John Harrington reviewed ''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it 2 stars out of 5, and stated that "Despite the graphics and the very familiar subject matter, it is not particularly addictive. It is, perhaps, a bit too cerebral for your average shoot-em-up fan and probably a little too reliant on arcade adventure to appeal to the adult market."<ref name="gi12">{{cite journal | last = Harrington |first = John | title =Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 12 | pages =50 |date=January 1990}}</ref>

[[Charles Ardai]] reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "It could have been so much more, though, than ten minutes of excitement followed by twenty years in a display case. That it isn't, especially with so much going for it, is a true pity."<ref name="CGW69">{{cite magazine | last=Ardai | first=Charles | authorlink=Charles Ardai |title=KLINGONS, GO HOME!
