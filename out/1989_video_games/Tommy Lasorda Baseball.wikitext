'''''Tommy Lasorda Baseball'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''Super League'''''|スーパーリーグ|''Sūpā Rīgu''||lead=yes}} in Japan and Europe.}} is a 1989 baseball video game developed and published by [[Sega]] as one of the six launch titles for the [[Sega Genesis]] in the North America and for the [[Sega Mega-Tech]] arcade system. It is a follow-up to the [[arcade game]] ''Super League'' (1987).<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:Mdfan_JP_1992-05.pdf&page=103|title=Way to the Sega Fan: Sega Arcade History (1987) – スーパーリーグ|magazine={{ill|メガドライブFAN|lt=Mega Drive Fan|ja|Mega Drive Fan}}|issue=28|publisher=[[Tokuma Shoten]]|date=May 1992|page=103|lang=ja}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Famitsu DC|author-link=Famitsu DC|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:Sega_Arcade_History_JP_EnterBrain_Book.pdf&page=49|chapter=Chapter 3|title=H, Y board & SYSTEM 16, 18, 24, 31: 1985 – スーパーリーグ|work=セガ・アーケード・ヒストリー (Sega Arcade History)|series=Famitsu Books|publisher=[[Enterbrain]]|date=February 15, 2002|page=90|language=ja|isbn=9784757707900}}</ref> It prominently features former [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] player [[Tommy Lasorda]], who was manager of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at the time. In the game, players compete with either [[AI]]-controlled opponents or against other players across single exhibitions, open matches or a 30-game season.

''Tommy Lasorda Baseball'' formed part of a marketing campaign to build a library of titles using recognizable names and likenesses of celebrities and athletes to emphasize the more arcade-like experience available on Sega Genesis. The game garnered mixed to positive reception from critics since its release on the Genesis; praise was given to the addition of season play, use of multiple perspectives, sound, two-player component and gameplay but criticism was geared towards this aspect being luck-based and difficult AI, while others felt mixed in regards to the graphical quality and recommended similar titles instead.
