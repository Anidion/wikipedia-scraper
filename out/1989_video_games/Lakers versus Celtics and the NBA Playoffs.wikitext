'''''Lakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs''''' is a [[basketball]] [[video game]] developed and released by [[Electronic Arts]]. It was first released in 1989 for [[MS-DOS]]-compatible PCs and for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] in 1991. The game was highly successful; it was the first game endorsed by the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and was the first to contain multiple NBA stars and teams in one game. The game's title alludes to the 1980s [[Celticsâ€“Lakers rivalry|rivalry]] between the [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]].
It is the first game in the [[NBA Live (video game series)|NBA Playoffs]] series of games.

The game would be the first team basketball video game to acquire full players names and rights without actually relying on the [[NBA Players Association]]. Established stars in the game include [[Larry Bird]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] (DOS version only), [[Magic Johnson]], [[Michael Jordan]], and [[Patrick Ewing]].

The game introduced innovations in presentation. It was the first NBA game to feature TV style starting line up prior to the [[opening tip]]. It also featured [[halftime show]]s and announcers to simulate an authentic feel. Later games would go further by replacing music during gameplay with audience cheers.  The game was conceived by Producer Don Traeger, and principal work done by programmer Robert Weatherby and Art Director 
Michael Kosaka.    It was the first game to feature the EASN logo, a stand-alone sports brand that Traeger had conceived with marketing partner Don Transeth and Artist Michael Kosaka.  This brand later evolved into EA Sports.

==Gameplay==
The game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, "Exhibition" or "Playoffs". There are also four difficulty levels: Pre-season, [[Regular season]], [[Playoffs]] and Showtime. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters.

Signature moves for individual star players who have their own were introduced, such as [[Charles Barkley]]'s gorilla dunk.

===Teams===
Players can pick from one of eight teams who were among the 16 that had competed in the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] the year before the game was released. The MS-DOS version contained teams from the [[1989 NBA Playoffs]], while the Genesis version contained the playoff teams from the [[1990 NBA Playoffs]].

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised ''Lakers versus Celtics''{{'}} graphics, but stated that it was too easy to play for action gamers and that scoring was too high for statistics-oriented players, and unfavorably noted the lack of league play or custom lineups.<ref name="cgw199109">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=86 | title=Slammin' and Jammin' / Courtside Criticism on Computer Basketball Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1991 | access-date=18 November 2013 |author1=Spezzano, Dan |author2=Lee, Wyatt | pages=108}}</ref> The game scored 88% in [[Computer and Video Games]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue113/Pages/CVG11300092.jpg|title = Computer & Video Games}}</ref> ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' placed the game at #24 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.<ref>Mega magazine issue 1, page 76, [[Future Publishing]], Oct 1992</ref>
