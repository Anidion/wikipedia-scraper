'''''Line of Fire''''' is a first-person [[light gun shooter]] game developed by [[Sega]] and released for [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1989. It was released with two [[arcade cabinet]] versions, a standard upright and a sit-down cockpit, both featuring two [[Light gun#Positional guns|positional guns]]. The cockpit design allows the player(s) to sit down while playing the game, while having two-handed machine guns,<ref name="Zero"/> controlled by a [[potentiometer]]-controlled gun alignment software system.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=New Products: Sega's Line of Fire |magazine=RePlay |date=January 1990 |volume=15 |issue=4 |page=127 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-14-issue-no.-4-january-1990-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2014%2C%20Issue%20No.%204%20-%20January%201990/page/127}}</ref> The game follows a two-man commando unit as they try to escape from a terrorist facility after seizing a prototype weapon.

The arcade game was praised by critics for its [[pseudo-3D]] graphics and cockpit cabinet, but with the gameplay criticized for being derivative of ''[[Operation Wolf]]'' (1987) and ''[[Operation Thunderbolt (video game)|Operation Thunderbolt]]'' (1988). It was converted for [[home computers]] and published by [[U.S. Gold]] in 1990, and then released for the [[Master System]] in 1991; however, the style of the latter was changed to that of an overhead [[run and gun video game]]. The home computer versions were criticized for "blocky" visuals, though reviewers found that there were some nice touches, while the Master System version also received mixed reviews.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Line of fire gameplay.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]

The game sees the player placed as a member of a two-man commando team who have been charged with going behind enemy lines to bring down a terrorist organisation which has access to a large arsenal of weaponry. During the mission the team find a "special weapon", which is a vehicle mounted, automatic machine pistol, and must report their findings. However, the player is faced with many enemy troops and military vehicles which need to be destroyed in order for the commando squad to escape in the jeep, and must use the "special weapon" against the terrorists.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=February 1991|author=Douglas, Jim|title=Line of Fire|issue=41|pages=60–61}}</ref>

The game is played from a first person perspective, with two cabinet-mounted positional guns used to shoot enemies on the screen. There are eight stages which take place in various settings, including the enemy base, jungle, canyons, desert and ruins.<ref name="format" /> At the end of each is a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] vehicle which must be destroyed in order to progress. Ammunition is limited to a few clips of bullets for the machine gun, a small supply of hand grenades and a screen clearing missile, although additional supplies can be obtained by shooting the relevant icon when they appear during play.<ref name="cumerritt" />

The stages scroll both horizontally and into the screen via a [[pseudo-3D]] effect, and due to Sega's dedicated [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] handling hardware and software, the game was able to combine the two movements in a single instance, thus effectively creating the illusion of twists and turning corners. This revolutionary engine allowed the player to experience a somewhat convincing 3D landscape.<ref name="action" /> Between stages, a map screen is displayed which shows the player progressing through the terrorist facility and towards freedom.

==Development==
The ''Line of Fire'' arcade machine uses the [[Sega X Board]] hardware, comprising two [[Motorola 68000]] processors running at 12.5Mhz as its [[CPU]], and sound is reproduced using a [[Yamaha YM2151]] sound chip. It features [[raster graphics]] at a resolution of 320 x 224 pixels on a horizontally orientated monitor.<ref name="klov" /> There are two different [[arcade cabinet]]s available for the game. One cabinet allows the player(s) to sit down as they are playing the game,<ref name="cuarcade" /> reaching forward to use the cabinet mounted [[light guns]]. The other is an upright cabinet with attached light guns.<ref name="klov">{{Cite web|url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8432|title=Line of Fire - Videogame by Sega (1989)|publisher=[[Killer List of Videogames]]|accessdate=2009-12-16}}</ref>

[[Image:Line of fire sms screen.jpg|thumb|right|The Master system version is a vertically scrolling shooter.]]

[[U.S. Gold]] acquired the licence to release the game on home computers, and versions were produced for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. The conversion for all five home computers was handled by Creative Materials and all were released in 1990.<ref name="release1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/line-of-fire/release-info|title=Release Information for Line of Fire|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> For these versions there is no light gun support: instead the player moves a [[crosshair]] using a mouse, joystick or keyboard to target enemies, and pressing a button to fire.

A version developed by [[Sanritsu Denki]] for the [[Master System]] was published by Sega in 1991,<ref name="smsrelease" /> This release is an overhead vertically [[scrolling shooter]], although the storyline and locations are mostly unchanged.<ref name="mean" /> The game does not feature light gun support, the player using the standard control pad. This game also features support for the [[Master System#SegaScope 3-D Glasses|SegaScope 3-D Glasses]], a way of viewing the game in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], if the player enters a button combination when starting up the console with the ''Line of Fire'' cartridge inserted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrogamingconsoles.com/consoles/sega-master-system/|title=Sega Master System|publisher=Retro Gaming Consoles|accessdate=2009-12-16}}</ref>

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Line of Fire'' on their February 1, 1990 issue as being the third most-successful upright arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=373|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 February 1990|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, it was one of the top four highest-grossing arcade games during [[1990 in video games|early 1990]], along with ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[Tecmo World Cup '90]]'' and ''[[List of Sega arcade games|Super Masters]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Openshaw |first=Mary |title=ATEI '90: major international show rings in new year with good spread of new products |magazine=RePlay |date=March 1990 |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=126–32 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-14-issue-no.-6-march-1990-600dpi/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2014%2C%20Issue%20No.%206%20-%20March%201990/page/126}}</ref> In North America, ''Line of Fire'' was the top-grossing new video game on the ''RePlay'' arcade charts in [[1990 in video games|July 1990]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=RePlay: The Players' Choice |magazine=RePlay |date=July 1990 |volume=15 |issue=10 |page=4 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-14-issue-no.-11-august-1990-600dpi/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2014%2C%20Issue%20No.%2011%20-%20August%201990/page/4}}</ref>

The arcade game was met with a positive-to-mixed reception from critics, with praise for its pseudo-3D graphics and sit-down cabinet but with a mixed response to its derivative gameplay heavily based on ''[[Operation Wolf]]'' and ''[[Operation Thunderbolt (video game)|Operation Thunderbolt]]''. ''Line of Fire'' received a positive review from ''[[Sega Power|S: The Sega Magazine]]'', calling it an "Utterly fab" game with "Amazing [[3D graphics]]" and "heart-stopping action throughout."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Line of Fire |magazine=[[Sega Power|S: The Sega Magazine]] |date=December 1989 |issue=2 (January 1990) |page=9 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/c/c5/StheSegaMagazine_UK_02.pdf#page=9}}</ref> ''RePlay'' magazine praised the "impressive" graphics and action, stating "the graphics are extremely crisp" and clear, the "explosions look real" and it "achieves a near 3D depth effect" with "realistic backgrounds" that scroll "away" as enemies "come flying in towards you" while stating the gameplay is "a no-holds-barred joyride through explosions and action that just doesn't quit."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Leadership: Sega USA does it again with 'Line of Fire' and some hot kits |magazine=RePlay |date=January 1990 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=23–6 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-14-issue-no.-4-january-1990-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2014%2C%20Issue%20No.%204%20-%20January%201990/page/23}}</ref>

Sean Kelly of ''[[Zero (video game magazine)|Zero]]'' magazine called it "the best game" at London's 1990 [[Amusement Trades Exhibition International]] (ATEI) and stated that, despite being "an ''Operation Thunderbolt'' derivative" it "goes about ten steps better." He praised the "fantastic graphics and sonics throughout" the game, "some rather excellent original ideas" and the "brilliant two-handed machine guns" in the sit-down cabinet.<ref name="Zero">{{cite magazine |last1=Kelly |first1=Sean |title=Arcade Expo: A.T.E.I.

There was praise for the sit-down cabinet, but the reviewer said this was the only lasting appeal, although they found it a nice touch that defeated enemies stay on the screen rather than disappearing after a few moments, allowing the player to survey the scene they have just created.<ref name="cuarcade">{{Cite journal|date=February 1990|title=Line of Fire|journal=[[CU Amiga]]|issue=64|pages=89|url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/288/209}}</ref>

Retrospectivaly, ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' praised the graphics, comparing its [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] manipulation to later [[first-person shooters]] and [[Texture mapping|textured-mapped]] [[3D computer graphics|3D polygons]], but said the gameplay is "nothing spectacular".<ref>{{cite web |title=Line of Fire |url=http://hg101.kontek.net/lineoffire/lineoffire.htm |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=11 April 2021}}</ref>

===Home conversions===
The home conversions received mixed reviews. The Commodore 64 version received a score of 32% in ''[[Zzap!64]]'' magazine, with a lack of enemies on screen being a major criticism, although it was said that the attempt at 3D was impressive. The reviewers found the difficulty curve a problem, with level one being too easy and too long, followed by tougher later levels.<ref name="Zzap!64">{{Cite journal|date=March 1991|author=Wynn, Stuart|author2=Hogg, Robin|title=Line of Fire|journal=[[Zzap!64]]|issue=71|pages=69}}</ref>

The Amiga version was more well received, although it was still not without faults. Tony Horgan said in ''[[Amiga User International]]'' that a "great job has been done in recreating the graphics of the original"  but found the pace a little slow. He said that this kind of game works better in an arcade as home conversions do not manage to hold the player's attention.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=March 1991|author=Horgan, Tony|title=Line of Fire|journal=[[Amiga User International]]|volume=5|issue=3|pages=64}}</ref> The same ''Zzap!64'' review as the Commodore 64 version said that the Amiga version had good presentation with regards to the introduction and map screens between levels, but that the in game graphics were "blocky", and that there were perhaps too many enemies on screen at any one time, in stark contrast to the Commodore 64 version.<ref name="Zzap!64" /> ''Amiga Action'' magazine thought that the Amiga conversion was a "first class conversion from a decent [[coin-op]]", and that it really captured the feel of the arcade machine. A minor criticism was that the scoreboard at the top of the screen can obscure enemies from the player's view, leading to damage being inflicted on the player's character.<ref name="action">{{Cite journal|date=February 1991|title=Line of Fire|journal=Amiga Action|issue=17|pages=94–95 |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_90_pages}}</ref> ''[[Amiga Format]]'s'' Trenton Webb praised the Amiga version's speed and said that the graphics "mimic their arcade parent as well as any non-custom circuit set could hope to", although the sprites look rather blocky.<ref name="format">{{Cite journal|date=January 1991|author=Webb, Trenton|title=Line of Fire|journal=[[Amiga Format]]|issue=18|pages=74–75}}</ref> Steve Merritt said in ''CU Amiga'' that the Amiga version is more playable that the arcade version, but that the last few levels should have been made more difficult.<ref name="cumerritt">{{Cite journal|date=January 1991|author=Merritt, Steve|title=Line of Fire|journal=[[CU Amiga]]|issue=75|pages=56–57}}</ref> Richard Leadbitter gave both the Amiga and ZX Spectrum versions 85% in his review for ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine, praising the pace of the game, especially in the ZX Spectrum version.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=January 1991|author=Leadbitter, Richard|title=Line of Fire|journal=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=110|pages=130–131}}</ref>

The Master System version received mixed reviews. ''[[Console XS]]'' gave it an 82% score.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Software A-Z: Master System |magazine=[[Console XS]] |date=23 April 1992 |issue=1 (June/July 1992) |publisher=[[Paragon Publishing]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=137–47 |url=https://archive.org/details/console-xs-01/page/137}}</ref> It was met with some disappointment by the reviewers in ''[[Mean Machines]]'', due to it being a very different version to the original arcade game. They said that the Master System had been proved more than capable of running games similar to the original, mentioning ''[[Dynamite Duke]]'' as an example. They said that it was a poor overhead shooter and although the game has the same locations and general storyline of the original the graphics are too small and badly drawn to be able to tell. They also found the game very easy, it only took one of the reviewers an hour to reach the last level. They thought that people who played the original in the arcade would be the most disappointed of all.<ref name="mean">{{Cite journal|author=Rad|author2=Rich|title=Line of Fire|journal=[[Mean Machines]]|issue=15|pages=124–125|date=December 1991|url=https://archive.org/details/mean-machines-magazine-15/page/n125/mode/2up}}</ref>
