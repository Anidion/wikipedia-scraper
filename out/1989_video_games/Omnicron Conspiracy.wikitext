Dennis Owens reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Omnicron Conspiracy'', because of its logical puzzles, ease of interaction, and humorous (sometimes, downright sweet, small touches), can certainly be recommended. It makes an interesting change of pace and offers an entertaining story for anyone who likes graphic adventures."<ref name="CGW63">{{cite magazine |last=Owens |first=Dennis |title=Epyx Unleashes The Omnicron Conspiracy |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September 1989 |volume=1 |issue=63 |pages=14}}</ref>
