==Gameplay==

''Double Dunk'' is a simulation of two-on-two, half-court basketball. Teams have two on-screen characters, a shorter "outside" man and a taller "inside" man. In a single-player game, the player controls the on-screen character closest to the ball, either the one holding the ball (on offense) or the one guarding the opponent with the ball (on defense). In two-player games, each player may control one of the two teams as in a one-player game, or both players may play on the same team against a computer-controlled opponent. At the start of each possession, both offense and defense select from a number of plays (such as the [[pick and roll]] on offense), then attempt to score or regain possession of the ball by intercepting or stealing it from the offense.<ref name="DDInst">{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=153|title=Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Double Dunk (Atari)|work=AtariAge.com|access-date=2010-10-13}}</ref>

The game offers a number of player-selectable options. Games can be set to last a certain amount of time or until one team scores a certain number of points. Three-point shots can be turned on or off, as can a ten-second [[shot clock]]. Players may also choose to include foul detection and/or a [[three seconds rule|three-second lane violation]].<ref name="DDInst"/>
