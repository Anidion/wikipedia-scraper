'''''Vendetta''''' is a 1989 [[beat 'em up]] [[video game]] released by [[System 3 (company)|System 3]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

== Plot ==
A group of terrorists have kidnapped a professor and his daughter. The professor is working on a bomb. The terrorists make impossible demands and threaten to detonate a miniature nuclear weapon if the demands are not met. 

The protagonist, initially armed with only a knife, decides to rescue both individuals. Along the way, he collects other weapons and evidence to convince other police officers to let him continue his work, as he heads to an army base, a booby-trapped airplane, and finally central park, where the terrorists make the last stand.

== Development ==
''Vendetta'' was based on the same rendering method and display used by ''[[The Last Ninja]]'', but used a rewritten engine. This game engine was then used for the game ''[[Last Ninja 3]]''.<ref name="ln-lemon64">[http://lastninja.lemon64.com/updates_old.php Last Ninja fan page], "The Vendetta engine was written from scratch and then used as the basis for LN3."</ref>
