==Story==
The character Emmanuelle in the game is a wife of French business man whose job requires constant travelling, thus leaving his wife unfulfilled. Emmanuelle has taken a lover, Marc, but later suffers pangs of conscience, because she still loves her husband. Emmanuelle travels to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil, to escape him, but is followed by Marc. The aim of the game is to augment Marc's erotic potential, so he can seduce Emmanuelle again.<ref name="ST"/><ref name="power"/>

The player's 'erotic potential' is increased by following the three laws of eroticism: law of numbers (seduce as many ladies as you can), law of asymmetry (try to seduce an odd number of ladies) and a law of surprise (seduce preferably concealed/masked ladies). Furthermore, the player should find three erotic statuettes. The game involves no [[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]] scenes, though the Marc persona might catch Emmanuelle disrobing, by looking through a certain keyhole. More often, however, Marc sees only an old gentleman who is engaged in washing his feet.

==Gameplay==
The DOS version supports [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] and monochrome graphics,<ref name="power"/><ref name="theodor"/> while the Amiga and Atari ST versions uses 16 colours.<ref name="theodor"/> ''Emmanuelle'' is a point-and-click adventure, but the DOS version has no mouse support.<ref name="theodor"/> The game uses multiple-choice dialogues for conversations.<ref name="power"/><ref name="theodor"/> The game includes sub-games such as gambling at a casino where the player has to raise money for flight tickets.<ref name="power"/><ref name="theodor"/> The player might also end up fighting with angry husbands and smugglers due to their exploits.<ref name="power"/><ref name="theodor"/>

==Reception==
The reviewer of ''ST-Computer'' praised the game's graphics, but criticized the lack of sounds and the ease of the puzzles.<ref name="ST"/> The ''PC Power Play'' review said that the game was boring and only titillating in the casino sequences; it also criticized the poor graphics and the lack of sound.<ref name="power"/> A later issue ''PC Power Play'' gave ''Emmanuelle'' an "award", as the game with the most idiotic dialogue.<ref name="power-worst"/>
