{{nihongo foot|'''''Golden Axe'''''|ゴールデンアックス|Gooruden Akkusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[hack-and-slash]] video game released by [[Sega]] for [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1989, running on the [[List of Sega arcade system boards|Sega System 16B]] arcade hardware.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7966 |title=Golden Axe |publisher=The International Arcade Museum}}</ref> [[Makoto Uchida (game developer)|Makoto Uchida]] was the lead designer of the game, and was also responsible for the creation of the previous year's ''[[Altered Beast]]''. The game casts players as one of three warriors who must free the fantastical land of Yuria from the tyrannical rule of Death Adder, who wields the titular Golden Axe.

The game was well received at the time of release, ''Golden Axe'' was later converted for play on many different home systems, including Sega's own [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] and [[Master System]]. The game's success spawned an entire [[Golden Axe|franchise]] consisting of several sequels and various spin-offs.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]''-style [[high fantasy]] [[medieval fantasy|medieval world]]. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle.  He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical [[emblem]] of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a [[battle axe]]-wielding [[Dwarf (folklore)|dwarf]], Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male [[barbarian]], Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed [[basket-hilted sword|broadsword]], looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a [[longsword]]-wielding [[Amazons|Amazon]], [[Tyris Flare]], whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.

The warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive/Genesis and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.

The arcade release of the game concludes with a [[fourth wall]]-breaking end sequence with some children playing ''Golden Axe'' at an arcade. The arcade game breaks, and the characters from within the game flood into the "real world", with the children being chased by the enemies, with the warriors in hot pursuit.

==Gameplay==
Progress is made through the game by fighting through Death Adder's henchmen, including men armed with [[club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s, skeleton warriors, and knights. Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast [[magic (game terminology)|spells]] that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of "bars" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue "magic potions" attained by kicking little [[sprite (folklore)|sprites]] who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during [[bonus stage]]s in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different maximum number of magic bars and varying ranges of attack.

Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the [[Cockatrice]] (which also appeared in ''[[Altered Beast]]''),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_076#page/n31/mode/2up Axes to Grind, The Legend of Golden Axe], [[Retro Gamer magazine]], issue 76. Pages 38–45</ref> which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire depending on its colour scheme, is found later in the game.

If the players take too long to advance, skeleton swordsmen emerge from the ground, like in the film ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVc1QNGo_g0C&q=%22golden+axe%22+%22jason+and+the+argonauts%22&pg=PA126 |title = The Video Games Guide: 1,000+ Arcade, Console and Computer Games, 1962-2012, 2d ed|isbn = 9781476600673|last1 = Fox|first1 = Matt|date = December 2012| publisher=McFarland }}</ref>

In addition to the main quest, some home versions of the game included "duel mode", a survival mode type game that pitted players against increasingly powerful foes in consecutive rounds of play. This mode also featured a two-player one-on-one option.

==Development==
Lead designer and producer [[Makoto Uchida (game developer)|Makoto Uchida]] was fond of [[action movies]], particularly the ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]'' films, and wanted to create a game influenced by them. He said that the development team for the game was small and development of the game took about a year.<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZAUURPSgYI The Making of Golden Axe: Beast Rider. Part 1].</ref> Uchida's "idea was to come up with a ''[[Double Dragon]]'' that was not a ''Double Dragon''… [[Technōs Japan|Technos]] was an experienced rival who had been working on the ''[[Kunio-Kun]]'' series, so there was no way we could compete if we did the same thing as them. I had a feeling that arcade games should be competitive against the great hit [[Console game|console]] title ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' (created by [[Enix]]) and therefore studied the world of magic and swords, combined this with the gameplay of ''Double Dragon'', and finally came up with the concept of ''Golden Axe''."<ref>[http://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-making-of-golden-axe/ "The Making Of Golden Axe"] (2014-12-02). ''RetroGamer.net''. Retrieved 2019-01-31.</ref> Uchida also cited the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' (1987) as an influence, particularly how players could combine button moves and stick presses to perform individual attacks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games |date=2018 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-7225-0 |page=150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xT1jDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA150}}</ref>

==Ports==
The Mega Drive/Genesis version remained largely faithful to the arcade game, adding a level and a duel mode, along with a new ending.

The [[IBM PC compatible]] port released in 1990 is similar to the Mega Drive/Genesis version, but includes a 256-colour [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] mode as well as support for [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], and [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules]] modes. [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] ports released in late 1990 by [[Virgin Software]] are similar to the arcade.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Penn|first=Gary|url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-27/page/n77/mode/2up|title=Golden Axe|date=December 1990|newspaper=[[The One (magazine)|The One]]|issue=27|page=79}}</ref> The Amiga port is similar to the arcade game, with some palette changes and without parallax scrolling.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Penn|first=Gary|url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-27/page/n81/mode/2up|title=Golden Axe|date=December 1990|newspaper=[[The One (magazine)|The One]]|issue=27|page=82|quote=When asked: 'Surely having to put all that stuff from the big and hard arcade machine into a poxy little home computer [the Amiga and ST] has meant that he's had to leave stuff out?' programmer Richard Costello replies: 'No, not really. The only major difference is minor graphical details.'}}</ref>

Variations of the original game have also been released. The [[Master System]] version of the game retells the original story from the perspective of Tarik, a barbarian with resemblances to Ax Battler (much like all the other barbarian in the entire series: Kain Grinder, Stern Blade and Kain Blade). While the game is only one-player, it features all of the levels and magic powers of the arcade version. In Japan, ''Golden Axe'' was released by Telenet for the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine CD-ROM]] in 1990 with high-quality resampled music and [[cut scene]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrOBNcWLuAU  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/rrOBNcWLuAU |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|title=PC Engine Longplay [040&#93; Golden Axe |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2012-07-26}}{{cbignore}}</ref>
