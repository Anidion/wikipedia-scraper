'''''Risk: The World Conquest Game''''' is a [[computer game]] developed by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Mastertronic International]] in 1989 for [[DOS]].

==Gameplay==
This game is based on the board game ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]''. The player can play against up to five computer opponents. The player can select to play using either the British or American version of ''Risk'', with either version of the extra armies cards.<ref name="Dragon156"/>

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that while the computer version offered the convenience of an automated opponent for solitary players, the board game would likely be more fun for most because they would not have to crowd around the computer, which could not easily display the entire world at once.<ref name="wilson198910">{{cite magazine | title=Risky Business | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1989 | author=Wilson, David M. | pages=55 | issue=64}}</ref>

M. Evan Brooks reviewed the computer editions of ''Risk'', ''[[Monopoly (1985 video game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[The Computer Edition of Scrabble|Scrabble]]'', and ''[[Clue: Master Detective|Clue]]'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "In this reviewer's opinion, ''Scrabble'' is the weakest product (given cumbersome play and graphics), while ''Risk'' and ''Clue: Master Detective'' are the strongest."<ref name="CGW69">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M. Evan |title=CLASSIC CONVERSIONS |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=March 1990 |volume=1 |issue=69 |pages=44–45}}</ref>
