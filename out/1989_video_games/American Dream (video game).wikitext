==Summary==
The player must earn [[United States dollar|money]] in order to become the wealthiest [[gambler]] in the world.<ref name="hcoregame101"/> The game, set in [[New York City]], is considered a spin-off from the ''Pachio-kun'' franchise.<ref name="hcoregame101"/> [[Al Capone]] has a cameo role in this game even though he lived about one thousand miles to the west ([[Chicago]]) in real life.<ref name="gamefaqs"/>

Roads, taxis and automobiles are not portrayed in the game.<ref name="hcoregame101"/> However, a black [[limousine]] that escorts the player from the [[air force]] base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is [[concrete]] (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated [[Apartment building|tenement]]s, shiny [[tower]]s, or as flashy casinos.<ref name="hcoregame101"/>

An [[English language]] translation was made in 2007 by a ROM hacker who goes by the nickname of "Pale Dim."<ref name="paledimromhack"/> Using the game's upper case letters that resemble the [[Joystix]] font, the English translation allows players in English-speaking countries to better understand the game.<ref name="paledimromhack"/> One of the changes made was to change the explosion sound from the Japanese ''Bom'' to the English ''Boom''.<ref name="paledimromhack">{{cite web |date= |title=English translation information |url=https://www.romhacking.net/translations/1102 |accessdate=2008-10-18 |publisher=ROM Hacking}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

===General gameplay===
[[File:AmericanDreamYouAreUnderArrest.PNG|thumb|left|Pachio-kun (representing the player) is being arrested by a police officer on a "rural" road in New York City for having a pistol. From the English translation by Pale Dim.]]
The player starts out in the poorest district of [[Brooklyn]] and must work through the boroughs of [[New York City]] outside Manhattan, including [[Queens]] or [[The Bronx]], in order to amass wealth.<ref name="gamefaqs"/>  With luck and finesse, the player can ultimately break the bank in [[New Jersey]].  To enter a casino, the player must find a permit (which serves as photo identification for the casinos) somewhere in Brooklyn.<ref name="gamefaqs"/> Slot machines come in denominations from $1–$100000 depending on the neighborhood and the presence of a [[Very Important Person|VIP]] card. Three types of slot machines can be played at each level and the player is photographed when winning the jackpot.<ref name="gamefaqs">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/file/579478/47575| title = Game summary | publisher = GameFAQs | date = | accessdate = 2008-05-12}}</ref>

Players must be wary of [[dice game]]s that have dangerous risks in addition to [[card game]]s - they randomly appear like monster battles in traditional role-playing games. Many buildings including [[airport]]s, [[police station]]s, and [[casino]]s either help or hinder the player's attempts to earn enough money on the [[slot machine]]s for passage to the wealthier district.<ref name="gamefaqs"/> Guns (in the form of a pistol) can be found that can protect the player against muggers.<ref name="hcoregame101"/> However, the police will confiscate the weapon from this player once they arrive at a certain area in Manhattan.<ref name="hcoregame101"/> Pachiko-kun (the player) will also be arrested and will be held unless a $100,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1989|r=2}}}} in today's money) [[bail]] can be paid in full.<ref name="gamefaqs"/>

===Glitch===
The game gets a little fuzzy when the player only has $10 left to spend and the player is in Manhattan.<ref name="gamefaqs"/> The game is not over but the player cannot spend it because it is not even considered to be a single [[Token coin|token]].<ref name="gamefaqs"/> This would result in a [[Unwinnable|walking dead]] situation; the only remedy is to reset the game.
