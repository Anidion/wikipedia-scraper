'''''Super Mario Land'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|'''''Super Mario Land'''''|スーパーマリオランド|Sūpā Mario Rando|}}}} is a 1989 [[Platformer|platform game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] as a [[launch game]] for its [[Game Boy]] [[handheld game console]]. It is the first ''Mario'' platform game to have been released for a handheld console (not including the earlier [[Game & Watch]]). In gameplay similar to that of the 1985 ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', but resized for the smaller device's screen, the player advances [[Mario]] to the end of 12 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] by moving to the right and jumping across platforms to avoid enemies and pitfalls. Unlike [[List of Mario games|the other ''Mario'' games]], ''Super Mario Land'' is set in Sarasaland, a new environment depicted in line art, and Mario pursues the debuting [[Princess Daisy]]. The game has two ''[[Gradius]]''-style [[shooter game|shooter]] levels.

At Nintendo CEO [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]]'s request, Game Boy creator [[Gunpei Yokoi]]'s [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Nintendo R&D1]] developed a ''Mario'' game to sell the new console. It is the first handheld console ''Mario'' game and the first to be made without Mario creator and Yokoi protégé [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Accordingly, the development team shrunk gameplay elements for the device and used some elements inconsistently from the series. ''Super Mario Land'' was expected to showcase the console until [[Nintendo of America]] [[pack-in|bundled]] ''[[Tetris (Game Boy video game)|Tetris]]''. The game launched alongside the Game Boy first in Japan in April 1989, and later worldwide. ''Super Mario Land'' was rereleased for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] via [[Virtual Console]] in 2011, and on the [[Nintendo Switch Online]] service in 2024, which features some presentation tweaks.

The game was lauded by critics, who were satisfied with the franchise's transition to the Game Boy, but they also noted its short length. This was in reference to both contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers, who particularly praised its soundtrack. The handheld console became an immediate success and more than 18 million copies of ''Super Mario Land'' were sold, more than ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. The game received two sequels, including ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' (1992) and ''[[Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3]]'' (1994), the latter of which would later be spun-off into its own sub-series, ''[[Wario Land (series)|Wario Land]]''. ''Super Mario Land'' has been included in several top Game Boy game lists and debuted Princess Daisy as a recurring [[List of Mario franchise characters|''Mario'' series character]].

As a [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] and the first in the ''Super Mario Land'' series,<ref name="IGN: building"/> ''Super Mario Land'' is similar in gameplay to the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' series.<ref name="IGN: Bad"/> As [[Mario]], the player advances to the end of the level by moving to the right and jumping across platforms to avoid enemies and pitfalls,<ref name="Nintendo Life: SMB"/> the screen only scrolls to the right, as the player advances, but will not scroll back to the left, and sections of a level that have passed off screen cannot be revisited. Mario travels to Sarasaland to save [[Princess Daisy]] from Tatanga, an evil spaceman.<ref name="Game Informer: 25 best GB p5"/> Two of the game's twelve levels are "forced-scrolling" ''[[Gradius]]''-style [[shooter game|shooters]] where Mario helms a submarine or airplane and fires projectiles towards oncoming enemies, destructible blocks and bosses.<ref name="IGN review"/> Levels end with a platforming challenge to reach an alternative exit located above the regular exit, the former leading to a [[bonus stage|bonus]] [[minigame]] styled after a [[Ghost Leg]] lottery that awards 1 to 3 [[Life (gaming)|extra lives]] or a Superball Flower power-up.<ref name="Eurogamer: retrospective"/>

Unlike [[Mario (franchise)|the other ''Mario'' games]], which take place in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], ''Super Mario Land'' is set in Sarasaland<ref name="IGN: imposter"/> and drawn in [[line art]].<ref name="IGN: building"/> Mario pursues Princess Daisy, in her debut, rather than the series standard [[damsel in distress]], [[Princess Peach]].<ref name="IGN review"/> When jumped on, [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] shells explode after a small delay, Mario throws bouncing balls rather than fireballs (referred to as "Superballs" in the manual),<ref name="Eurogamer: retrospective"/> 1-Up Mushroom power-ups are depicted as hearts, and the level-end flagpoles are replaced with a platforming challenge.<ref name="IGN: imposter"/> Compared to ''Super Mario Bros.'', which contains 32 levels subdivided into 8 "worlds" with 4 levels each, ''Super Mario Land'' is smaller, with 12 levels subdivided into 4 "worlds" with 3 levels each. There are five unique bosses, one at the end of each of the four worlds, and a fifth and final boss being Tatanga, who appears when the fourth boss is defeated. The first three bosses may be destroyed with projectiles, or the player may move past them to the exit without destroying them first; the last level has no regular exit, and the two bosses at the end of that level must be destroyed with projectiles to complete the level and the game. Some elements recur from the previous ''Mario'' games, such as blocks suspended in midair, moving platforms that must be used to traverse pitfalls, pipes that lead to other areas, collectible coins that grant an extra life when 100 are collected, and [[Goomba]] enemies.<ref name="IGN review"/> After the player has completed the game they may [[New Game Plus|play through again]] on a harder mode, in which the levels are the same apart from enemies being more numerous; if the player completes the harder mode, the game allows the player to start another play on any level in the game.

==Development==

''Super Mario Land'' was developed by [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Nintendo R&D1]] and published by [[Nintendo]] in 1989 as a launch game for its [[Game Boy]] handheld console.<ref name="IGN review"/> Nintendo CEO [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] believed that fun games promote console sales,<ref name="IGN: history1"/> so when the company created the Game Boy, he wanted a fun game featuring Nintendo's mascot, Mario.<ref name="IGN: history3"/> The task came to Nintendo R&D1, a development team led by Game Boy inventor [[Gunpei Yokoi]].<ref name="IGN: history3"/> Yokoi had previously created the [[Game & Watch]] series and worked with his protégé, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], on the game that introduced Mario, ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref name="IGN: history1"/> ''Super Mario Land'' is the fourth ''Super Mario'' game,<ref name="IGN: building"/> the first portable Mario game, and the first in the series to be made without Miyamoto.<ref name="IGN: history3"/>

Absent Miyamoto's direction, the development team used elements new and inconsistent with the series as ''Super Mario Land'' shrunk elements of the series to fit the portable device's small screen.<ref name="IGN review"/> Yokoi, the head of R&D1, served as producer,<ref name="IGN: imposter"/> and [[Satoru Okada]] served as director. They had previously developed ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' (1986) and ''[[Kid Icarus (video game)|Kid Icarus]]'' (1986) together, and the two subsequently designed the Game Boy—Yokoi on its industrial design, and Okada on its engineering.<ref name="IGN: GB history"/> Their ''Super Mario Land'' was planned as the portable console's showcase title until [[Henk Rogers]] brought ''[[Tetris]]'' to [[Nintendo of America]] and convinced [[Minoru Arakawa]] that the addictive computer game would help Nintendo reach the largest audience. The company subsequently chose to bundle ''Tetris'' with every Game Boy purchase.<ref name="IGN: GB history"/>

The Game Boy was released in Japan in April 1989, North America in July, and Europe in September 1990,<ref name="Game Informer: 25 best GB p1"/> and ''Super Mario Land'' became a launch game.<ref name="IGN: GB history"/> Its official first release was on April 21, 1989, in Japan, and its North American release followed in August.<ref name="IGN review"/> About 22 years later, ''Super Mario Land'' was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] via [[Virtual Console]] on June 6, 2011, as one of its opening games.<ref name="IGN: eShop"/> Its new features include an increased size (about 60 percent zoom) and an optional "shades of green" color palette to match the effect of the original Game Boy's monochrome.<ref name="IGN review"/> The game was released on the [[Nintendo Switch Online]] service on May 15, 2024.<ref name="NSO" />

IGN's Lucas Thomas wrote that the protagonist, enemies, and overall game were shorter, and noted that Mario himself was just 12 pixels in height on the Game Boy's small screen.

==Legacy==
[[File:Game-Boy-FR.jpg|thumb|''Super Mario Land'' was a launch game for the Game Boy in 1989.]]

The game began a ''Super Mario Land'' series of portable Mario games. ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' added a non-linear overworld and introduced villain [[Wario]], an evil version of Mario. The subsequent ''[[Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3]]'' began the [[Wario (franchise)|''Wario'' franchise]]. After 19 years, the 2011 game ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] became Mario's first game in [[stereoscopic 3D]]. Audrey Drake of IGN argued that both ''Wario Land'' and ''Super Mario 3D Land'' are not "legitimate sequels", and wrote that the latter seems more like "''Super Mario Bros. 3'' with ''[[Super Mario Galaxy|Mario Galaxy]]'' influences" than a successor to ''Super Mario Land 2''.<ref name="IGN: imposter"/> The ''Superball Flower'' appears in ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]'' as an unlockable power-up item, usable only in the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' style.

''Super Mario Land'' is remembered for its miniaturized ''Super Mario'' elements<ref name="IGN: building"/> and "twist on just about every Mario mainstay imaginable".<ref name="IGN: imposter"/> Many of its new elements do not recur later in the series, making ''Super Mario Land'' strange compared to the rest of the series, or what IGN's Thomas described as a "singular oddball".<ref name="IGN review"/> IGN's Marc Nix said retrospectively that ''Super Mario Land'' was the only uninspired ''Mario'' game, with "funky voids of white" and UFOs instead of the "strikingly original" Mushroom Kingdom.<ref name="IGN: Bad"/> ''Mean Machines'' was also put off by the alien theme, easy difficulty, and dot matrix screen blur.<ref name=MM/> IGN's Travis Fahs wrote that the game was comparatively not as "ambitious" as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''.<ref name="IGN: GB history"/> ''Mean Machines'' said it was not "a true ''Mario'' game", not worth its originally high review score, and "in retrospect, not really a classic".<ref name=MM/> Glen Fox of ''Nintendo Life'' agreed, writing that it was an impressive achievement at the time but did not age as well as other ''Mario'' games.<ref name="Nintendo Life" />

''Eurogamer''{{'}}s Schilling wrote that Mario felt different—lighter, with more friction—and that the game felt "radical and distinctive" for the risks it took.<ref name="Eurogamer: retrospective"/> IGN's Thomas cited "out of place" gameplay elements like the shooter levels, exploding Koopa shells, non-extinguishing fireballs, and non-Princess Peach plot as departures from the series.<ref name="IGN review"/> Thomas attributed this to ''Mario'' creator Miyamoto's lack of involvement in the game's development, which he described as "famously hands-off".<ref name="IGN review"/> Schilling of ''Eurogamer'' instead blamed the [[Game Boy|Game Boy's]] technical limitations. But he too was perplexed by the new sphinx, seahorse, and [[Moai head]] enemies, and considered the exploding Koopa shells a "cruel trick" disdainful of the series' core gameplay.<ref name="Eurogamer: retrospective"/> ''Super Mario Land''{{'}}s shooter levels, new to the series, were not revisited in subsequent ''Super Mario'' games except the ''Maker'' games. Subsequent series games such as ''Super Mario Land 2'' both dropped the original's tiny scale and chose the classic [[fire flower]] fireballs over the first installment's bouncing balls.<ref name="IGN review"/>

The game was included in multiple rankings of top Game Boy games,<ref name="Game Informer: 25 best GB p5"/><ref name="Complex: best"/><ref name="VG mag"/> and ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' listed it at 73 in its top 100 Nintendo games.<ref name="ONM: 100 Best"/> After her debut in ''Super Mario Land'', Princess Daisy appears in later [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' series sports]] and [[List of Mario racing games|racing games]].<ref name="IGN review"/>

===Popular music===
{{Main|Supermarioland (song)}}
The song "[[Supermarioland (song)|Supermarioland]]" (1992) by British group Ambassadors of Funk was inspired by the game and became a novelty hit, appearing in the UK top ten charts. [[Simon Harris (musician)|Simon Harris]], the mastermind behind Ambassadors of Funk, said that he initially had no intention to create ''[[Super Mario]]''-themed compositions, but after his friend introduced him to Nintendo's Game Boy console, he became fond of the theme music from ''Super Mario Land'', composed by [[Hirokazu Tanaka]]. He realised that the songs on the game's [[Video game music|score]] had a similar tempo to [[house music]], so he was able to incorporate the samples into "Supermarioland" easily, recruiting Einstein to provide the rap vocals. After Harris created the track, he contacted Nintendo to clear the music samples, and the company, liking what Harris had done, also requested that he and Einstein record an album of ''Super Mario'' material. Nintendo UK quickly began to promote and market "Supermarioland", even providing an actor for the music video, but [[Nintendo of America]] was difficult to contact, and the track was never released in the United States. Mario's designer, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], approved the project, and the album, titled ''Super Mario Compact Disco'', was released in Japan in August 1993, featuring tracks from other Mario games such as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''.<ref name="diver">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-11-12-revisiting-nintendos-novelty-pop-hit|title=Revisiting Nintendo's novelty pop hit|last=Diver|first=Mike|website=[[Eurogamer]]|date=12 November 2017|access-date=21 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/11/random_looking_back_on_that_time_when_mario_gatecrashed_the_uk_music_charts|title=Random: Looking Back on That Time When Mario Gatecrashed the UK Music Charts|last=McFerran|first=Damien|website=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=13 November 2017|access-date=21 June 2021}}</ref>

=== Fan-made remake ===

A homebrew for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] called ''New Super Mario Land'' came to light in 2019 after a series of posts on [[Twitter]] by a user named ChronoMoogle. The remake features enhanced visuals, music and a multiplayer mode for up to 4 players.<ref name="Nintendo Life: NSML 1">{{cite web |date=November 21, 2019 |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/random_super_mario_land_has_been_ported_to_the_snes_and_it_looks_amazing |access-date=February 13, 2023 |title=Random: Super Mario Land Has Been Ported To The SNES, And It Looks Amazing}}</ref> According to its creator, who gave an interview to ''Nintendo Life'' while asking to remain anonymous, the remake was built totally from scratch (hence, no [[ROM hacking]] was performed) using [[Assembly language]], a few tools for graphics and sound and a Super Nintendo [[Console emulator|emulator]] for testing. After developing the game, the creator flashed the game in thirty [[Nintendo Power (cartridge)|Nintendo Power]] cartridges and distributed them to his "Nintendo-loving friends" as a Christmas gift to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the original game. The creator no longer has involvement with the game, stating that "the project is terminated already" after sending the gift cartridges.<ref name="Nintendo Life: NSML 2">{{cite web |date=November 22, 2019 |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/feature_the_story_behind_new_super_mario_land_the_homebrew_marvel_intended_as_a_christmas_gift |access-date=February 13, 2023 |title=Feature: The Story Behind New Super Mario Land, The Homebrew Marvel Intended As A Christmas Gift}}</ref>
