'''''Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander''''' is a video game and the sequel to ''[[Star Fleet I: The War Begins]]''.

==Development==
This sequel to ''[[Star Fleet I: The War Begins|Star Fleet I]]'' was published in 1989 by Interstel Corporation, but was only in production for a few months due to internal problems at Interstel. The game was much more complex and sophisticated than ''Star Fleet I''. It involved many different ships types, including battlecruisers, destroyers, heavy and light cruisers, frigates, troop transports, freighters, scouts, and starliners. Fleet operations were possible and the universe included hundreds of planets to utilize or conquer. It was only released for [[DOS]] although versions for the [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] were under development but never finished.

The game was designed and written by Trevor Sorensen and Mark Baldwin, with planet fractal generator by Dennis Lawler.

The game was released with [[Software bug|bugs]] and needed a [[patch (computing)|patch]] to be completely operational,<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/star-fleet-ii-krellan-commander|name=''Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander''}}</ref> but ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' reported in 1992 that Interstel "never did get it to run correctly" and that the game's bugs "destroyed the parent company".{{r|brooks199211}} The [[DOS]] version of the game can now be found as [[freeware]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}. Some of the freeware versions of the game are the original flawed game (version 1.0) and not the final patched version (version 1.5B).

In 2018 the original developer, Trevor Sorensen, started to work on ''Star Fleet II'' again. In 2020, he released Version 1.5C to playtesters in January. This version had many new features and bug fixes to the previous Version 1.5B. Version 1.5D arrived in March, with even more new features and bug fixes, to playtesters. A more advanced Version 1.6 was released in December. Star Fleet II Version 2.0 was released in November 2023 for sale on Steam and [[GOG.com]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1470940/STAR_FLEET_II__Krellan_Commander_Version_20/|title=STAR FLEET II - Krellan Commander Version 2.0 on Steam}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1470940/view/3820802116169456167|title=Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander 2.0 Released}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gog.com/news/classic_release_star_fleet_ii_krellan_commander_version_20|title=Classic Release: STAR FLEET II - Krellan Commander Version 2.0}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
''Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander'' allows players to command a Krellan battlecruiser with small complement of escort vessels.  Like ''Star Fleet I'', ''Star Fleet II'' has an officer ranking system using some [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] style names. The sequel improved the graphic appeal, allowed for players to conquer planets, take over enemy starships (commanding Krellan shock troops to go various levels of the ship) and so forth.

The game was reviewed in 1990 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #154 by Hartley, Patricia and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon154">{{cite journal |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser |last2=Lesser |last3=Lesser |first1=Hartley |first2=Patricia |first3=Kirk |journal=Dragon |issue=154 |date=February 1990 |pages=76–83}}</ref> M. Evans Brooks of ''Computer Gaming World'' in 1989 gave the game a mixed review, praising the rich gameplay but noting that a number of bugs and other flaws marred the experience. Brooks also criticized the "primitive" ASCII graphics, slow load times between menus, and the need for a "Tutorial Disk and Training Manual" which was sold separately.<ref name = "CGW">{{citation |date=November 1989 |author=Brooks, M.
