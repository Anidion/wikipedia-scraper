'''''F29 Retaliator''''' is a [[combat flight simulator]] [[video game]] developed by [[Digital Image Design]] and published by [[Ocean Software]] in 1989 [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]], 1991 for the PC, and for the [[FM Towns]] and [[NEC PC-9801]] in 1992-1993. Its working title was just ''Retaliator''. The game was developed during the end of the [[Cold War]], based mostly on speculations on then-future aircraft that were expected to be in use by the year 2002, in particular based on the design of the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|Lockheed Martin F-22]] and the [[Grumman X-29A]].

==Gameplay==
The graphics were detailed by the standards of the period, featuring cities, bridges, roads, islands, mountains and moving vehicles. The cockpit of either the F-22 or the X-29A has three [[multi-function display]]s available to set up in a number of configurations. The fantastic "future" weapons to choose from include a fighter-carried [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]], rearward-firing [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] air-to-air missiles and a gigantic [[cluster bomb]].<ref>[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/185824/features/f29-retaliator/ PC Feature: F29 Retaliator - ComputerAndVideoGames.com]</ref>

The game includes four war scenarios ([[Arizona]] desert test and training sites, [[Pacific]] conflict, [[Middle East]] conflict and the [[World War III]] in Europe) each with several missions, with the total number of those adding up to 99. The last mission of the game can be any of three, and completion of each one leads to [[Types of fiction with multiple endings|different game endings]]. The PC version allowed head-to head [[dogfight]]ing using a [[null modem]] cable.

==Reception==
The game received 4 out of 5 stars in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]''.<ref name="Dragon174">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk|name-list-style=amp|journal=Dragon|issue=174|date=October 1991|pages=57–64}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' described ''F29'' as a less-expensive alternative which "still offers a solid game-playing experience, with limitations". While noting limitations such as a small game environment, the magazine concluded that "despite its limitations, ''F-29'' is an enjoyable diversion" for those new to flight simulators.<ref name="case199110">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 | title=F-29 Retaliator / Or the ATF on a Budget | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | last=Case | first=Loyd Jr. | pages=64, 66 | issue=87}}</ref> A 1992 survey in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game three stars out of five,<ref name="brooks199206">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

==Legacy==
A "Special Mission" add-on was released with ''[[Zero (video game magazine)|ZERO]]'' magazine in 1990, featuring a battle against the alien spacecraft from the then-upcoming space combat game ''[[Epic (video game)|EPIC]]''.<ref>''Zero'' 12 (October 1990)</ref> ''Retaliator 2'', announced in 1990 to be released in the first quarter of 1991,<ref>''[[Advanced Computer Entertainment]]'' 37 (October 1990), p.22-23</ref> was never released as the team concentrated on finishing ''EPIC'' (released in 1992 and using an improved engine of ''F29''). DID would later create three further, much more realistic F-22 simulators: ''[[TFX (video game)|TFX]]'' (1993), ''[[F-22: Air Dominance Fighter]]'' (1997), and ''[[F-22 Total Air War]]'' (1998).
