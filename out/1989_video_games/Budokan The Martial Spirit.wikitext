'''''Budokan: The Martial Spirit''''' is a [[fighting game]] published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1989 for the [[Amiga]] and [[MS-DOS]] compatible operating systems. The game pits the player against other [[martial art]]ists in a  tournament known as the ''Budokan'' at the [[Nippon Budokan]] in [[Tokyo]]. Ports for the [[Sega Genesis]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[Amstrad CPC]] were released in 1991.

== Gameplay ==

The player begins the game as an apprentice in the Tobiko-Ryu Dojo, and initially practices skills in four [[dojo]]s, either ''Shadow Fighting'' (Jiyu-renshu) or sparring with an instructor (Kumite). The weapons and combat methods available to the player consist of:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=260|title = Budokan: The Martial Spirit - Manual, Docs - Lemon Amiga}}</ref>

#[[Bo (weapon)|Bo]]: classic Japanese long staff
#[[Karate]]: Okinawan unarmed combat
#[[Kendo]]: Japanese fencing utilizing a wooden sword
#[[Nunchaku]]: swinging weapon with two shafts connected by a chain

Once the player is confident in their skills, they can go to the Free Spar mat to engage a human or computer opponent, or enter the Budokan tournament where the player faces consecutive opponents equipped with various weapons or combat forms (including, but not limited to, those available to the player).  During the tournament the difficulty gradually increases, with each opponent demonstrating increasing prowess when compared to the previous.  Most opponents are male, except for one female armed with a [[naginata]].  The gender of a [[ninjutsu]] opponent with a masked face is presumably female, as they are named Ayako.

Each match is preceded by a briefing screen which provides the player with a short description of the upcoming opponent. The player chooses a weapon to use in the match; however, each weapon or combat form may only be used a maximum of four times, requiring strategic choices in order to fight effectively. After three consecutive losses to the same opponent, the player must face the previous one again. The game ends if the player loses three times to the first opponent or runs out of weapons.

There are two primary attributes shown on the screen -- ''stamina'' and ''ki'', the power of each blow.  Active movements like jumping and delivering difficult blows decrease the ki, while blocking attacks increases it.  As a fighter's stamina decreases, movements slow down, making it more difficult to act.  The first fighter whose stamina is completely exhausted loses the match.
