==Development==
In Japan, ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?

==Gameplay and plot==
As with other games in the series, ''Japan'' sees the player follow clues in locations around Japan to track down Carmen's henchmen and eventually Carmen herself. Players require a correct warrant to successfully arrest the perpetrator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ayachi0610.blog65.fc2.com/blog-entry-170.html|title=The 69th is a hidden masterpiece "CARMEN SANDIEGO IN JAPAN" game that arrests criminals across the country!|last=Daichi|first=Ayachi|date=August 13, 2019|website=Ayachi0610|access-date=2019-08-25|archive-date=2019-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825035430/http://ayachi0610.blog65.fc2.com/blog-entry-170.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Eco News noted that the game is realistic in the sense that the number of days it takes to track the thief changes as the travel distance increases; while noting the software is difficult for elementary school students with little knowledge of geography, the magazine argued it was targeted toward junior high students.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=December 1990|title=Carmen Sandiego in Japan|url=https://www.eri21.or.jp/econews/eco16.pdf|journal=Eco News|issue=16|pages=4|access-date=2019-08-25|archive-date=2019-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825051024/https://www.eri21.or.jp/econews/eco16.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>
