{{nihongo foot|'''''Neutopia'''''|ニュートピア|Nyūtopia|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is an [[overhead perspective|overhead]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure video game]] developed by [[Hudson Soft]]. It was released by Hudson for the [[PC Engine]] in Japan on November 17, 1989. It was then released by [[NEC]] for the [[TurboGrafx-16]] in North America in 1990. It was re-released for the [[Virtual Console]] service worldwide for the [[Wii]] in 2007; it was re-released for the [[PlayStation Network]] in Japan in 2010 and in North America in 2011. It was re-released for the [[Wii U]] on April 16, 2014 in Japan, and in USA and Europe in 2017. The game takes place in the land of Neutopia, where the evil demon Dirth has captured Princess Aurora and has stolen the eight ancient medallions which contain the wisdom and power necessary to maintain peace and prosperity throughout the land. It is up to the protagonist Jazeta to retrieve the eight medallions, defeat Dirth, rescue Princess Aurora, and save the land and its people.

''Neutopia'' is widely regarded as a clone of the popular [[Nintendo]] game ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' in nearly every aspect. Many reviewers have praised the game for making noticeable improvements over ''Zelda'', but various shortcomings – which include long [[password (video games)|password]]s unless the system is used in conjunction with an add-on providing battery-backed RAM, repetitive gameplay, and poor collision detection – prevent the game from being superior to the 1986 Nintendo title. Overall, reviewers have called ''Neutopia'' one of the better video games of its type and one of the better titles in the TurboGrafx-16 library. The game received a sequel, ''[[Neutopia II]]'', in which Jazeta disappears and his son sets out to find him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/826/826761p1.html|title=Neutopia II Review|last=Thomas|first=Lucas M.|date=2007-10-12|publisher=IGN|access-date=2011-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325200558/http://wii.ign.com/articles/826/826761p1.html|archive-date=2012-03-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Plot==
''Neutopia'' takes place in the distant past in the land of Neutopia – a prosperous and peaceful land in which the people worshipped at a Sacred Shrine and were watched over by Princess Aurora.<ref name="Manual1">[[#manual|Instruction manual]], p. 1.</ref> The land was divided into four contiguous areas called spheres: land, subterrain, sea, and sky.<ref name="4spheres" /> The people lived in prosperity and happiness with the help of eight spiritual medallions which were controlled by the Princess and were used for good;<ref name="EvilEnds">[[#game|''Neutopia'']], land sphere. "'''Man''': Evil is everywhere now that Dirth has captured the powers of the medallions. Under the Princess' control the medallion's power was put only to good use. Our country prospered from the wealth and happiness that the medallions gave us. Now Dirth controls that power and he will undoubtedly use it to fulfill his own evil ends."</ref> a "Climactic Castle" was built as a symbolization of their prosperity.<ref>[[#game|''Neutopia'']], sea sphere. "'''Lady''': "The sphere of the sky used to be such a lighthearted place. Everyone was high on life. The Climactic Castle was built in the sky because it was a symbol of our cheerful lives."</ref> Each of the medallions represented powers of an ancestor whom Neutopia's nemesis, the evil demon Dirth, turned to stone but whose spirit remains.<ref>[[#game|''Neutopia'']], land sphere. "'''Man''': Each of the medallions holds the virtues of the man who Dirth cast to stone. Although the man is no longer alive, his spirit lives on in the force of the medallions. Not even the mighty Dirth can destroy a man's spirit. Use this force on your journey."</ref><ref>[[#game|''Neutopia'']], Sacred Shrine. "'''Mother''': Dirth was our fathers' arch enemy and he used his power to cast our fathers into stone."</ref>

Then, one night, Dirth appears and invades the land. He sends his army of demons to ravage the land, and he captures Princess Aurora and holds her captive in the Climactic Castle, where he would rule over the invading demons.<ref>[[#game|''Neutopia'']], subterranean sphere. "'''Old man''': As you well know, Dirth has stolen our most precious treasures and the Princess. But did you know that he is holding her captive in the icy cold northern castle? He has hid her in the creepy Climactic Castle where he can rule all his demons below. I'm sorry I can't be of much help to you but please take this with you. [gives 150 gold to Jazeta] Be careful!"</ref> He also steals the eight medallions, which he now controls for evil purposes;<ref name="EvilEnds" /> he scatters the eight medallions across the four spheres and places them in crypts.<ref name="4spheres" /><ref name="SecretCrypts" /><ref>[[#game|''Neutopia'']], Sacred Shrine. "'''Mother''': We have news that Dirth has spread the medallions in his labyrinths and has hidden the Princess in his crypt."</ref> A young warrior named Jazeta arrives at the Sacred Shine, where he is given a "charmed compass" which "has the force of the medallions" and can guide him to them.<ref>[[#game|''Neutopia'']], sea sphere. "'''Man''': The first crypt is to the south of here. It is very difficult to find the entrance because the goona have hid it well. Use your compass at all times. The charmed compass has the force of the medallions."</ref> He is also told that he would inherit the wisdom of his ancestors and win the Princess' love if victorious.<ref>[[#game|''Neutopia'']], Sacred Shrine. "'''Mother''': Use this compass to direct you to each of the medallions. The power and wisdom of our ancestors and the love of the Princess will be your reward."</ref> Jazeta then ventures out to defeat Dirth and rescue Princess Aurora, so that she can free Dirth's spell over the ancient ancestors' spirits and use the medallions to restore peace to Neutopia.<ref name="Manual1" /><ref>[[#game|''Neutopia'']], sea sphere. "'''Old man''': The 8 medallions are the only memory we have of our great founding fathers. Dirth was opposed to all they stood for: brotherhood, purity, honesty, happiness and love. He cast them to stone so only evil would influence us. The Princess is our only hope. She alone has the power to set them free of Dirth's eternal spell of stone."</ref>

==Gameplay==
''Neutopia'' is an [[action adventure game]] which features a [[top-down perspective]] and labyrinthine exploration similar to that of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''.<ref name="Thomas" /> The player controls Jazeta as he sets out to rescue Princess Aurora from Dirth. The game has four levels called spheres which Jazeta must explore and recover the two medallions from each.<ref name="Manual1" /><ref name="4spheres">[[#game|''Neutopia'']], Land Sphere. "'''Old Man''': We hear that there are four separate spheres in which he has placed the medallions... land, subterrain, sea, and sky. Seek out and explore the spheres to save our world."</ref> The medallions are hidden in crypts, where each medallion is guarded by a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]].<ref name="Manual1" /><ref name="SecretCrypts">[[#game|''Neutopia'']], Land Sphere. "'''Man''': On this sphere are two secret crypts. Make your may through the labyrinths to the crypts. Each of the crypts contain one of the medallions that Dirth has stolen. Use the special compass to lead you through the maze."</ref> After collecting all eight of them, Jazeta gains access to the North Pole, where Dirth resides.<ref name="TurboPlay">{{cite journal |title=''Neutopia'' |journal=[[TurboPlay]] |issue=1 |date=June–July 1990 |pages=4–13 |url=http://archives.tg-16.com/turbo_play_0001.htm#t04 |access-date=2011-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716213803/http://archives.tg-16.com/turbo_play_0001.htm#t04 |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=live}}</ref> The player controls Jazeta by moving in any direction with the control pad. Jazeta can also attack with his weapons or use items, scroll through messages, or access the "status screen" with the controller.<ref name="Manual2">[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], p. 2.</ref> Jazeta's [[life meter]], the weapons he is currently holding, and the amount of gold and bombs remaining are displayed during gameplay on the top of the screen. On the status screen, players can choose an item to use, see which direction they must travel as indicated by the charmed compass (which also sounds an alarm when Jazeta is near a crypt or a medallion), and view the map of the crypt Jazeta is in, provided they have collected the Crystal Ball inside.<ref name="Manual3">[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], p. 3.</ref>

[[File:Neutopia gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|The basic gameplay of ''Neutopia'', which shows off the fire rod weapon.]]
Throughout the game, players can collect information from other [[non-player character]]s, many of whom are located in caves throughout the overworld, in which some can be uncovered only by burning objects with fire, blowing up walls with bombs, or by pushing certain rocks.<ref name="Thomas" /><ref name="Manual8">[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], p. 8.</ref> While Jazeta's main weapon is a sword, he can also use other items scattered throughout the game. The "fire rod" unleashes fireballs whose strength and range depend on Jazeta's health level;<ref name="Thomas" /> Other items include the "moonbeam moss" which can illuminate dark rooms; the "rainbow drop" which allows Jazeta to cross small gaps;<ref name="Shau" /> "falcon shoes" which give him extra speed; medicine which refills his life meter; magic rings which can transform tough enemies into weaker ones; hourglasses which temporarily stop enemies; and wings which can warp him back to the place where he last received a password. Jazeta can also obtain sword, shield, and armor upgrades throughout the game which can increase attack power, increase defense against projectiles, and decrease enemy damage, respectively; each type of sword, shield, and armor ranges from bronze to silver to "strongest".<ref>[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], pp. 4–5.</ref> Enemies in the game include spear-throwing [[goblin]]s, fireball-throwing fish, fake rocks,<ref name="Shau" /> ghosts, and charging knights.<ref>[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], p. 6.</ref>

Jazeta has a life meter, which increases by one unit every time the player collects a medallion or finds a monk throughout the spheres;<ref>[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], p. 4.</ref> it decreases whenever he gets hit, and the game [[game over|ends]] when it runs out. However, provided players have collected the "Book of Revival", they can [[continue (video gaming)|continue]] and restart the game wherever they have last obtained a [[password (video games)|password]], even after the console has been shut off; passwords also allow players to resume play at a later time.<ref name="Manual2" /> In addition, for users with a [[TurboGrafx-CD]] or a TurboBooster-Plus, they can save their progress in the systems' [[non-volatile memory|RAM]] via a "File Cabinet" feature; in the same places where passwords are distributed, players have the option to save the game in one of four available file slots, each of which can be overwritten at any time with a new file.<ref>[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], p. 7.</ref>

Since its release, people have widely regarded ''Neutopia'' as a clone of [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''. The PC Engine version of the game was reviewed in the February 1990 issue of German magazine Power Play, where reviewer Martin Gaksch called the game "''Zelda'' on the PC-Engine" and said that the "differences between ''Zelda'' and ''Neutopia'' must be found with an [[electron microscope]]". They said that the graphics, music, and gameplay were good, and that the only thing that kept ''Neutopia'' from being superior to ''Zelda'' was the 24-character password system and that the text was in Japanese.<ref name="Gaksch" /> 

''Neutopia'' received much coverage from various video gaming websites after its release on the Virtual Console, and each drew comparisons to ''Zelda''. Adam Romano from Defunct Games noted that ''Neutopia'' was released two years before ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and said that ''Neutopia'' "kept pace with or were actually ahead of the Nintendo curve". He said that gameplay and backgrounds remain varied and that "the fire rod weapon is especially fun to wield", but noted that the things that keep the game from being better than ''Zelda'' were repetitive and frustrating dungeon exploring, boring boss battles, long passwords (for those who do not own a TurboGrafx-CD), and several "head-scratching moments" which include references to [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] as well as quotes from ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name="Romano" /> Marcel van Duyn from Nintendo Life noted many similarities to ''Zelda'', including the existence of 8 dungeons and medallions, the need to blow up walls or burn bushes to uncover secrets, the dungeon designs, and the need to push blocks to uncover staircases. However, he noted that what sets it apart from ''Zelda'' are the fire rod, the ability to warp with wings, and a lower difficulty level. He concluded that the game, while copying ''Zelda'', might be better as it added additional features that set it apart.<ref name="vanDuyn" /> [[Destructoid]]'s Tony Ponce compared the game's copying of ''Zelda'' to ''[[China Warrior]]''{{'}}s copying of ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'', and he pointed out what are also considered ''Zelda'' clones such as ''[[Crusader of Centy]]'' and ''[[Alundra]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ponce |first=Tony |title=Off-Brand Games: ''Neutopia'' |date=29 May 2010 |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |access-date=May 20, 2011 |url=http://www.destructoid.com/off-brand-games-neutopia-174343.phtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529094805/http://www.destructoid.com/off-brand-games-neutopia-174343.phtml |archive-date=May 29, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[GameSpot]]'s Austin Shau reviewed ''Neutopia'' in November 2007 and said progression through the game was "quick and direct" but was also more linear, unlike with ''Zelda''. He praised the game for its variety of environments, which he said "helps to combat monotony", but he noted the lack of detail in the graphics itself. He also criticized the game's sound, in which he said the background music was a series of "grating instrumentations" while also pointing out the low-quality TurboGrafx-16 sound chip.<ref name="Shau" /> [[IGN]]'s Lucas Thomas called ''Neutopia'' "one of the most shameless ''Legend of Zelda'' clones ever created" in nearly every aspect. He praised one of the differences in the presence of the fire rod, which he said "is unlike any weapon the 8-bit Link ever wielded"; he also noted the clean, crisp graphics and a good quality soundtrack. He criticized another difference from ''Zelda'', that ''Neutopia'' had poor collision detection, saying that it can lead to additional damage to Jazeta, which causes the power of the fire rod to decrease and lead to the annoying "beeping sound" just as in ''Zelda''. In general, Thomas said that, despite its lack of originality, ''Neutopia'' is a good TurboGrafx-16 game which has deserved all the praise it has received.<ref name="Thomas" />
