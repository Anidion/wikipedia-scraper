'''''James Clavell's Shōgun''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] [[video game]] written by [[Dave Lebling]] and published by [[Infocom]] in 1989. It was released for the [[Amiga]], [[Apple II]], [[DOS]], and [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh]]. The game is based on the 1975 novel ''[[Shōgun (novel)|Shōgun]]'' by [[James Clavell]]. It is Infocom's thirty-third game.

==Plot==
The game reproduces many of the novel's scenes, few of which are interconnected in any way. The player assumes the role of [[John Blackthorne]], pilot-major of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] trading ship ''Erasmus''. During a voyage in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the year 1600, the ''Erasmus'' is shipwrecked in [[Japan]]. Blackthorne must survive in a land where every custom is as unfamiliar to him as the language. After learning some of the society's ways, he is drawn into a political struggle between [[warlord]]s and falls in love with a Japanese woman. Eventually, he embraces Japanese life and is honored as a [[samurai]].

==Development==
James Clavell contributed little to the design of the game, although he and Dave Lebling met several times. He treated the game as a traditional licensing agreement rather than a collaboration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://waxy.org/2008/04/milliways_infocoms_unreleased_sequel_to_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galax/#comment-1650044|title=Milliways: Infocom's Unreleased Sequel to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|date=17 April 2008|access-date=6 June 2008|archive-date=26 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126202150/http://waxy.org/2008/04/milliways_infocoms_unreleased_sequel_to_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galax/#comment-1650044|url-status=live}}</ref> Consequently, the game contains many scenes from the novel presented [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] or made thinly interactive.

Dave Lebling has said that he considers ''Shōgun'' the worst game he was ever responsible for overall, although he is proud of several of the ''timing'' puzzles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/171/|title=Dave Lebling Interview|last=Granade|first=Stephen|author2=Philip Jong|date=22 July 2001|work=Adventure Classic Gaming|access-date=31 May 2013|archive-date=28 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528040249/http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/171/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Release==
The ''Shōgun'' packaging includes two physical objects: a map representing John Blackthorne's [[Age of Discovery|"known world" of 1600]], and ''The Soul of the Samurai'', a booklet describing the history and significance of samurai swords.

==Reception==
[[Dave Arneson]] gave ''Shōgun'' a negative review in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''. He wrote that the linear nature of the game and poor hints contributed to [[guess-the-verb]] and trial-and-error gameplay, and that the illustrations—while "nice to look at"—did not provide information to play the game. Arneson praised the game's large size, but concluded that ''Shōgun'' was only "mildly interesting" and inferior to ''[[Zork Zero]]''.<ref name="CGW"/>

Dave Morris reviewed ''James Clavell's Shōgun'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it 1 star out of 5, and stated that "I would rather have seen this game taking the novel as a springboard for much more open adventure possibilities. As it stands, I can't see who could get anything out of it. Except Infocom and James Clavell, that is."<ref name="gi11">{{cite journal | last = Morris |first = Dave | title =Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 11 | pages =53 |date=December 1989}}</ref>
