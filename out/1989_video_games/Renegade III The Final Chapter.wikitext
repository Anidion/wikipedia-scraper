'''''Renegade III: The Final Chapter''''' is a scrolling [[beat'em up]] video game released on the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1989 by [[Ocean Software]] under their "[[Imagine Software|Imagine]]" label. The game is a sequel to ''[[Target: Renegade]]'' which itself is a sequel to the arcade game ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]''. Unlike the first two games, ''Renegade III'' follows the character known only as "Renegade" as he travels through time to rescue his captured girlfriend. It also dropped the two-player mode found in the previous title.

An [[Amiga]] version was developed but never released. It was leaked years later.<ref>Retro Gamer journal (Spanish edition). Issue 24, page 111</ref>
