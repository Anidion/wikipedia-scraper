'''''Military Madness'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''Nectaris'''''|ネクタリス|''Nekutarisu''||lead=yes}} in Japan.}} is a 1989 [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] originally developed and published by [[Hudson Soft]] in Japan and [[NEC]] in North America for the [[TurboGrafx-16]]. It is the first entry in the ''[[Nectaris series|Nectaris]]'' series. Set in the year 2089, players take command of the Allied-Union forces in a desperate offense against the Axis-Xenon Empire army on the [[Moon]] before they launch the S.A.M. (Supreme Atomic Missile) weapon to obliterate [[Earth]]. Its gameplay consists of moving units into positions to confront enemies in turn-based encounters determined by multiple factors, capturing factories to produce resources and repair units in order to occupy the enemy prison camp or destroy all enemy forces.

''Military Madness'' was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[Video game#Platform|platform]]s, each one featuring several changes and additions compared to the original TurboGrafx-16 version, in addition of re-releases through download services for other systems, among other ways to play it. The game garnered positive reception from critics, some of which praised the audiovisual presentation and favourably compared its gameplay with other titles in the same genre such as ''[[Desert Commander]]'' and ''[[Advance Wars]]'' but others criticized several aspects, while other versions were also met with similarly positive reception from reviewers as well. It was also cited as a key influence on ''[[Dune II]]''. A sequel, ''Neo Nectaris'', was released in 1994 for the [[PC Engine Super CD-ROM²]] [[Video game accessory#Add-ons/Peripherals|add-on]].

''Military Madness'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed turn-based strategy game where players assume command of the Allied-Union across sixteen increasingly difficult maps that take place at the Moon in 2089, each one giving a pre-determined set number of units to use, on a desperate offense against the Axis-Xenon Empire before they launch their doomsday weapon S.A.M. (Supreme Atomic Missile) to obliterate Earth.<ref name="MMmanual">''Military Madness'' manual (TurboGrafx-16, US)</ref> Available modes of play include the main single-player campaign that carries the main storyline, a tutorial mode dubbed "Manual" to learn about the game's overall rules and a two-player versus mode.<ref name="MMmanual"/> A password system used to keep progress of the single-player campaign.<ref name="MMmanual"/> After completing the first basic set of maps, the game starts again but at a more difficult advanced set of 16 maps once the last basic map is cleared.<ref name="MMmanual"/>

The main gameplay objective is to either occupy the enemy prison camp to free prisoners or destroy all opposing forces on the playfield and the player that does so first wins.<ref name="MMmanual"/> Players command their units on a [[hex map]], using a command box function, and each unit have different mobility range that varies according to their type except aircraft units in addition of possessing different shooting range.<ref name="MMmanual"/> Terrain plays an important role during battle sequences, as it can affect the outcome of encounters in terms of terrestrial unit's mobility, attack and defense.<ref name="MMmanual"/> Each unit also gains experience when involved in combat, becoming stronger with every encounter, while offensive and defensive capabilities are increased if friendly units are near to another friendly unit.<ref name="MMmanual"/>

Units cannot be produced, but the Allied-Union forces can capture enemy units if they are in factories, or find unsecured factories and gain units from them. Units can also be repaired by returning them to factories under Allied-Union control, however a stored unit cannot be moved until the current turn ends.<ref name="MMmanual"/> Transport units are also available to carry terrestrial units across the map.<ref name="MMmanual"/> Selecting the "End" command results with players finishing their current turn.<ref name="MMmanual"/> A unique gameplay feature is the "Zone of Control" system;<ref name="MMmanual"/> players can surround an enemy unit by forming a circle that decreases both its offensive and defensive capabilities, however players can move to one hex position after a unit was surrounded by enemy units.

=== Synopsis ===
In the twenty-first century, humans made a foray into the Moon but great powers were in fierce conflict over the scarce lunar resources and the Axis-Xenon Empire insisted on their occupation. On 6 April 2089, the Axis-Xenon Empire sent their army to the Moon to occupy almost the entire location and all lunar factories fell into the hands of the Axis-Xenon Empire, mass-producing weapons one after another. Those who disobeyed were captured and placed into prison camps around the Moon, while the Axis-Xenon Empire is preparing to launch the doomsday weapon S.A.M. (Supreme Atomic Missile) to attack Earth. Those who knew the plan, the Allied-Union forces, escaped from their captivity and headed towards the launch base of S.A.M. to thwart the ambitions of the Axis-Xenon Empire.<ref name="MMmanual"/><ref>{{cite video game|title=Military Madness|developer=[[Hudson Soft]]|publisher=[[NEC]]|date=1990|platform=TurboGrafx-16|level=Introduction}}</ref><ref name="GAMEWatch">{{cite web|last=Inamoto|first=Tetsuya|url=https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/feature/1239947.html|title=【PCエンジン mini全タイトルレビュー！】「ネクタリス」/「MILITARY MADNESS」- 月面を舞台とした戦略シミュレーションの傑作。これでこのジャンルにはまった人も多いはず|work=GAME Watch|publisher=Impress Corporation|date=13 March 2020|access-date=17 December 2020|language=ja|archive-date=14 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114105024/https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/feature/1239947.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hiroaki Kageyama of ''Oh!X'' reviewed the X68000 conversion titled ''Nectaris'', feeling disappointed for the visuals due to not making use of the X68000's graphic capabilities, while criticizing game's the overall strategies.<ref name="Oh!XX68Kn"/> However, the X68000 version proved popular among the X68000 userbase in Japan.<ref name="Oh!X129">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/OhX1990-1995/Oh%21X_1992-12#page/n27/mode/1up|title=The Softouch - Trend Analysis|magazine={{ill|Oh!X|lt=Oh!X|ja|Oh!X}}|issue=129|publisher=[[SB Creative|SoftBank Creative]]|date=December 1992|page=26|lang=ja}}</ref> The MS-DOS conversion, also titled ''Nectaris'', was met with positive reception from critics as well.

''Military Madness'' was also met with equally positive reception from reviewers since its re-release on the Wii's Virtual Console.

==''Neo Nectaris''==
In 1994 Hudson Soft released a sequel/remake of Nectaris for the PC-Engine Super System CD² called ''Neo Nectaris''. Neo Nectaris covers the events of the first game but then escalates to Mars, featuring new enemies known as Bioheiki as well as several other changes. It was never released in North America due to the discontinuation of the TurboGrafx-16 line in the region.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Nectaris |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=105 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1998|page=66}}</ref>

There is an English port of the game for iOS from 2010, but the game's AI does not work properly.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nectaris.tg-16.com/neo_nectaris-FAQ-duo-hudson.html | title=Neo Nectaris FAQ / Strategy Guide Homepage (1994, PC-Engine DUO, Hudson Soft, Japan) featured at BASE NECTARIS (USA)}}</ref>
