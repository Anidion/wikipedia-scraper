'''''Tunnels of Armageddon''''' is a [[computer game]] involving [[racing]] and [[shooting]] while avoiding obstacles.

==Summary==
The game features pseudo-3D graphics.  Gameplay involves piloting a futuristic spacecraft through a series of tunnels to a destination within a certain time limit.  Colliding into obstructions depletes a limited amount of shields given.  The game is [[Sci-Fi]] in theme.  The rather simple plot amounted to traversing deeper into tunnels to save Earth from evil aliens.  The PC version had support for both EGA and VGA graphics, as well as an Ad-Lib or Soundblaster soundcard.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tunnels of Armageddon at mobygames |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/2002/tunnels-of-armageddon/ |access-date=2023-03-22 |website=mobygames.com}}</ref>
