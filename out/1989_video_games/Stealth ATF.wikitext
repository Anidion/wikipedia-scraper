'''''Stealth ATF''''' is a [[Stealth aircraft|stealth fighter]] [[video game]] released by [[Activision]] in 1989 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The object of the game is to take out aircraft that are trying to destroy the player's stealth fighter. The game supports up to two players.

==Gameplay==

The player is in full control of their [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] stealth [[ground-attack aircraft|attack aircraft]]; controlling every aspect of the military flight experience from exiting the runway and battling other fighters while airborne to landing the plane after the battle is over. The fighter is equipped with [[machine gun]]s and [[missile]]s to take out enemy aircraft. Each level has different scenery and varying types of runways; for example, some levels will have a very long runway on solid ground, while others may have a very short one on a carrier out in the ocean. The player must also be aware of the damage the fighter has taken, the number of missiles it has remaining, and the [[altitude]] of the fighter (so it will not crash into the ground).

Missions take place in the potential military hot spots of the late 1980s. These locations are: such as the Middle East, [[Alaska]], and the Pacific.<ref name="mobygames"/>
