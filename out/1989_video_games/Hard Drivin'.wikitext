'''''Hard Drivin{{'}}''''' is a [[sim racing]] [[arcade video game]] developed by [[Atari Games]] in [[1989 in video games|1989]].<ref name="CU"/> Players test drive a [[sports car]] on courses that emphasize stunts and speed. It features one of the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]] driving environments<ref name=allgame>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=25766 |title=allgame - Hard Drivin' |access-date=June 22, 2008 |archive-date=November 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114132021/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=25766 |url-status=dead }}</ref> via a [[Arcade cabinet#Cockpit or environmental cabinets|simulator cabinet]] with a [[Haptic technology|haptic vibrating]] steering wheel and a custom rendering architecture.<ref name="system16">{{cite web|url=http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=770|title=system16.com|access-date=July 10, 2008}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Hard Drivin' in-game screenshot (Arcade).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]
Players drive a sports car in a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective, navigating one to two laps around a stunt track for their best time while avoiding hazards such as vehicles and obstacles. If scoring in the top 10 during certain modes, the player races against the computer-controlled Phantom Photon car. A manual transmission mode includes a clutch pedal and the possibility of stalling the car, along with a vibrating [[haptic technology|haptic vibrating]] steering wheel.

The player's driving progress is tracked by invisible waypoints, denoted by flags on the course map when the game ends due to time running out. Passing the waypoint half-way through the track grants the player extra time.

After crashing (either into another vehicle or missing an airborne landing), a ten second [[instant replay]] shows a wide aerial view of the player's movement and surrounding vehicles leading up to the crash. Following the replay, the player's car is placed back on the track at the last waypoint passed, which may be a significant distance from the point of collision. If the player's car goes off-road, a ten second countdown begins to return to the track, or else they will be stopped and returned, at a standstill, to the previous waypoint.

==Development==
Development of the [[3D computer graphics]] arcade hardware that was eventually used for ''Hard Drivin{{'}}'' began in the mid-1980s, several years before the game was released. At the time, Atari Games was owned by [[Namco]], and the two companies began working on a 3D arcade system. After Atari and Namco separated, each company developed its own arcade system in the late 1980s, based on the same prototype. Atari used an earlier version of the hardware for ''Hard Drivin{{'}}'', and Namco developed a more advanced version of the hardware called the [[Namco System 21]], used for ''[[Winning Run]]'' (1988).<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Harrison |first1=Phil |author1-link=Phil Harrison |title=Arcades: Namco's Winning Streak |magazine=[[Commodore User]] |date=August 1989 |issue=72 (September 1989) |pages=90–1 |url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-user-magazine-72/page/n89/mode/2up?view=theater}}</ref>

The development of ''Hard Drivin{{'}}'' began in 1988. Atari originally intended a 1988 release, but according to one of Atari's engineers and designers, it was delayed due to the dispute from its vice president claiming that no one would buy an arcade cabinet for {{US$|10000|1988|round=-3}} after ''[[The Last Starfighter]]'' arcade game was canceled for that reason a few years earlier. Weeks of research concluded that this price was acceptable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=the-last-starfighter&page=detail&id=4815|title=the last starfighter [coin-op] arcade video game, atari, inc.

In addition to the main [[Central processing unit|CPU]], ''Hard Drivin{{'}}'' uses two [[TMS34010]] 32-bit graphics-oriented processors and a [[digital signal processor]].<ref name="system16" />

===Physics===
The engine, transmission control, suspension, and tire physics were modeled in conjunction with Doug Milliken<ref>{{cite web|author=Jed Margolin |url=http://jmargolin.com/schem/schems.htm |title=Hard Drivin'/Race Drivin' Schematics |publisher=Jmargolin.com |access-date=August 26, 2014}}</ref> who is listed as a test driver in the game credits. In the 1950s, his father [[William F. Milliken Jr.|William Milliken]] of Milliken Research led a team at [[Calspan Corporation|Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] (later Calspan) that converted aircraft equations of motion to equations of motion for the automobile, and became one of the world's leading experts in car modeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bentleypublishers.com/ludvigsen/aq-milliken-biography.htm |title=Karl Ludvigsen - Mister Supernatural - Bill Milliken |publisher=Bentleypublishers.com |access-date=August 26, 2014}}</ref>

==Ports==
The contemporary home systems ''Hard Drivin{{'}}'' was ported to have tremendously less computing power than the arcade machine. These include the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive / Genesis]], and [[Atari Lynx]]. The [[Commodore 64]] version was only released as part of the ''Wheels of Fire'' compilation. A version for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] was programmed by Mark Morris, but was unreleased.

Nick Kelly of ''[[Commodore User]]'' reviewed the arcade version and said: "''Hard Drivin{{'}}'' is exactly what its name suggests — difficult. You won't master this quickly, and if you aren't used to driving a car it's going to be very tough for you indeed. But Atari can be proud of themselves for producing a coin-op which really does put you in the driving seat, and that is undeniably a major first".<ref name="CU"/>

''[[Zzap!64]]'' magazine regarded the Commodore 64 port as one of the worst C64 games of all time—criticizing the monochrome graphics, painful slowdown, and the lack of instant replays in the other 8-bit conversions. The magazine gave the game 20%.<ref name="ZZap64">{{cite magazine | magazine=Zzap!64 | title=Hard Drivin' | url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=068&page=086&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap | page=86 | issue=68 | date=December 1990 | access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref> In Japan, the Mega Drive version received a score of 30 out of 40 from a panel of four reviewers.<ref>"30 Point Plus - ハードドライビン".
