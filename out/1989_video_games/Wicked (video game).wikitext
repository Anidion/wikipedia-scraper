==Plot==
The protagonist of the game is sacrificed in order to become a ring of fire to combat the evil forces of darkness that mean to plunge the earth in eternal darkness. The evil forces exist in three different points of each [[Zodiacal constellation]].

==Gameplay==
The game consists of using the ring of fire to keep the evil spores at bay, preventing new evil portals existing, defeating guardians so that the good spores can spread and destroy the existing evil portals before the time runs out. The difficulty of the game is determined by the night and day cycle, which has longer nights in the later levels.
