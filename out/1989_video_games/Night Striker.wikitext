{{nihongo|'''''Night Striker'''''|ナイトストライカー|Naito Sutoraikā}} is a 1989 [[shoot 'em up]] video game developed and published by [[Taito]] for the [[Taito Z System]]. In the game, the player flies an armoured car shooting enemy invaders to destroy a terrorist organisation. ''Night Striker'' combines gameplay elements of Sega's ''[[Space Harrier]]'' and ''[[Out Run]]''. Versions were released for the [[Sega Mega-CD]] in 1993, [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] in 1995, and [[Sega Saturn]] (as ''Night Striker S'') in 1996. A version was released on the ''[[Taito Memories]] II Gekan''{{efn|{{nihongo|''Taito Memories II Gekan''|タイトーメモリーズII 下巻|Taitō Memorīzu II Gekan}}}} compilation for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2007. ''Night Striker'' received mixed reviews, and the Mega-CD version in particular was heavily criticised, primarily due to poor graphics. The music was composed by Taito's [[Zuntata]] sound team, and has been released separately.

== Plot ==
The game is set in a futuristic city in 2049. A terrorist organisation has kidnapped Doctor Masker Lindberry and his daughter. The United Nations Special Service Agency has dispatched their agents to investigate, but to no avail. Its leader is leading a task force (code named Night Striker) using armoured vehicles to rescue them and destroy the organisation.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Night Striker|developer=Taito|platform=Mega CD|scene=Story scene|date=28 May 1993}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
[[File:NightStriker.png|thumb|left|A typical game in progress]]
The player controls the car and shoots enemies encountered during the stage. Enemies and bosses include helicopters, aeroplanes, [[lorry|lorries]], robotic spiders, and boulders. The car can be manoeuvred in a similar manner to ''[[Space Harrier]]'' and can be moved around the screen. There are 21 stages, although the player only needs to complete six to complete the game. Stages' themes include, factories, tunnels, and city themes such as [[City centre|centres]], suburbs, and streets. Certain stages contain obstacles such as barriers which must be manoeuvred around. At the end of each stage, there is a boss,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=メガドライブFAN|title=ナイトストライカー|publisher=Tokumashoten Intermedia|date=June 1993|page=91|language=ja}}</ref> and after its defeat, the player is presented with a choice of route, like ''[[Out Run]]''. The car's "armour" refers to its shield capability; the car can absorb a certain number of hits before being destroyed. Defeating a boss gives the shield the capacity to withstand another hit. If the shield has run out and the car is hit, the game is over.<ref name="Hardcore">{{cite web|author1=Kurt Kalata|title=Night Striker|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/nightstriker/nightstriker.htm|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=24 October 2017|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914212653/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/nightstriker/nightstriker.htm|archive-date=14 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Night Striker manual|date=1993|publisher=Taito|pages=6–13|edition=Mega CD|language=ja}}</ref> In certain final stages, the car transforms: depending on the stage, it can become vehicles such as a motorbike or a robot.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Gemaga|Beep!

''Night Striker'' received mixed reviews. The Mega CD version suffers from poor graphics quality, as noted by reviewers. ''[[Mean Machines Sega]]'' noted that the graphics are "stupendously bad", and the sprites are "totally unrecognisable".<ref name=Mean /> ''[[Sega Power]]'' complained about the blocky sprites and lack of introduction and animated sequences, and also described the game as "unoriginal".<ref name=SegaPower /> The Japanese ''Sega Saturn Magazine'' gave a mediocre review.<ref name=SSM /> Neil West of ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' was especially negative: he criticised the graphics, saying the sprites, along with the flicker and "blocky" explosions, cause "a nightmarish mess of colour". He further condemned the lack of originality and challenge, and described the gameplay as "a shambolic travesty of modern entertainment". He described ''Night Striker'' as a "load of crap" and recommended that players "avoid this at all costs". The only positive comments he made were about the "fantastic" sound effects and "superb" music.<ref name=MegaRev />

The arcade version fared much better. ''Computer and Video Games'' described the graphics as "beautiful", praised its action, and described the game as a "must-play".<ref name=CVG /> In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''night Striker'' on their August 15, 1989 issue as being the fourth most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=362|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 August 1989|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' praised the rolling road sequences, and commented that the car would look like a blob on the [[ZX Spectrum]].<ref name=Sinclair />

The soundtrack was composed by [[Zuntata]], and released on the ''Night Striker Complete Album'' on 21 May 1993 in Japan by [[Pony Canyon]] and [[Scitron]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ナイトストライカー コンプリートアルバム|url=http://legendius.web.fc2.com/platinum_games/nightstriker/nightstriker_soundtrack.html|accessdate=22 August 2016|language=ja}}</ref> A similar album was released by [[Pony Canyon]] on 19 November the same year.<ref>{{cite web|title=ZUNTATAアルバムラインアップ|url=http://zuntata.jp/lineup/|website=ZUNTATA|accessdate=22 August 2016|language=ja}}</ref> The soundtrack was released on [[iTunes]] on 2 July 2008,<ref>{{cite web|title=Night Striker Arcade Sound Tracks|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/night-striker-arcade-sound/id331626961|website=iTunes|date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=22 August 2016}}</ref> and certain tracks were released on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] on Zuntata's ''Arcade Classics Volume One'' album.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jeremy Parish|title=Taito House Band Zuntata Joining the Ranks of Classic Video Game Vinyl|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/taito-house-band-zuntata-joining-the-ranks-of-classic-video-game-vinyl|website=USgamer|accessdate=22 August 2016|date=11 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Arcade Classics Volume One|url=https://www.shiptoshoremedia.com/store/albums/arcade-classics-volume-one|website=Ship to Store Phono Co.|accessdate=22 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vinyl Review: Zuntata — Arcade Classics Volume 1|url=http://modern-vinyl.com/2016/10/23/vinyl-review-zuntata-arcade-classics-volume-1/|website=Modern Vinyl|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=23 October 2016}}</ref>
