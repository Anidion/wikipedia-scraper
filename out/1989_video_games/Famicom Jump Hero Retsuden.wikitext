The game is set in a world that brings together many of the long-running titles, which include stories of the past and present at the time of their release, that had appeared in the magazine.  The game consists of a main character wandering and encountering the many ''Jump'' heroes as they try to save the world from an alliance of many of the most powerful and evil of the ''Jump'' villains.

The game sold 1.1 million [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]] for the [[Famicom]] in Japan.<ref name="fc">{{cite web |title=ファミコンソフト販売本数 |url=http://www.gamegyokai.com/rank/fc.htm |website=Gamegyokai |access-date=June 6, 2018}}</ref> It was the first title in the [[Jump (magazine line)#Video games|''Jump'' video game series]]. It had a sequel, ''[[Famicom Jump II: Saikyō no Shichinin]]''. Due to it being based on a magazine specifically localized for the Japanese market, the game was never released outside Japan.

==The 16 Heroes==
One of the main objectives of the game is to recruit 16 notable ''Jump'' hero characters in order to use them to fight against the enemies in the game's overworld, which is divided into several different areas.  Aside from the player character, the ''Jump'' characters that can be collected are:
* '''[[Kenshiro]]''' (''[[Fist of the North Star]]'')
* '''Nukesaku Aida''' (''[[Tsuide ni Tonchinkan]]'')
* '''[[Goku|Son Goku]]''' (''[[Dragon Ball]]'')
* '''[[Ryo Saeba]]''' (''[[City Hunter]]'')
* '''[[Arale Norimaki]]''' (''[[Dr. Slump]]'')
* '''[[Pegasus Seiya]]''' (''[[Saint Seiya]]'')
* '''Momotaro Tsurugi''' (''[[Sakigake!! Otokojuku]]'')
* '''Mankichi Tokawa''' (''Otoko Ippiki Gaki Daishō'')
* '''Reiki Kikoku''' (''Godsider'')
* '''[[Joseph Joestar]]''' (''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]: [[Battle Tendency]]'')
* '''Jouji Kanno''' (''[[Doberman Deka]]'')
* '''Isamu''' (''[[Kōya no Shōnen Isamu]]'')
* '''[[Tsubasa Oozora]]''' (''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'')

* '''Kyūichi Uno''' (''Astro Kyūdan'')
* '''[[Kinnikuman (character)|Kinnikuman]]''' (''[[Kinnikuman]]'')

Of particular note: Son Goku and Momotaro Tsurugi are the only characters who return in ''[[Famicom Jump II: Saikyō no Shichinin]]''. Of the series with hero characters, ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' also has a playable hero in the sequel, with Joseph succeeded by Jotaro Kujo. One NPC character in this game, Ryotsu Kankichi from ''[[Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo]]'', becomes playable as well in the sequel.
