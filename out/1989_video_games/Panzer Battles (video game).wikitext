Brian Walker reviewed ''Panzer Battles'' and ''[[Rommel: Battles for North Africa]]'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave them both a rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that "Despite their hard core titles, there is no reason why either of these games should be restricted to the wargames market. In essence, they are resource management games that should appeal to both military freaks as well as the rest of the gaming fraternity."<ref name="gi13">{{cite journal | last = Walker |first = Brian | title =Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 13 | pages =48–49 |date=February–March 1990}}</ref>

Paul Rigby for ''[[The Games Machine]]'' cautioned that although the Battlefront system used in the game may not have been state of the art despite regular upgrades, "there is still plenty to keep you occupied".<ref name="TGM">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-30/page/n78/mode/2up|title=The Games Machine Issue 30|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Dan Weaver for ''[[Compute!]]'' argued that for anyone looking to become an armchair general with this game, "The best part is that you don't have to worry about the Russian mud and snow slowing down your microprocessor as you advance on the enemy."<ref name="compute!">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1990-05-compute-magazine/page/n85/mode/2up|title = Compute!

Pat McDonald for ''[[Amiga Format]]'' warned although the game has "lots of rough edges", that "it feels original, has pace and gives a feel of real military command" and recommended it to anyone who likes the World War II period.<ref name="AmFormat">[http://amr.abime.net/amr_popup_picture.php?src=amiga_format/magscans/af037_1992_08/095.jpg&c=95377&n=1&filesize=289942 Amiga Format 1992] abime.net</ref>

Jonathan Davies for ''[[Amiga Power]]'' compared this game to ''[[Halls of Montezuma: A Battle History of the U.S. Marine Corps|Halls of Montezuma]]'' and felt "sure that ''Panzer Battles'' matches up to it in every way" while noting that in this game the "graphics are prettier".<ref name="AmPower">[http://amr.abime.net/amr_popup_picture.php?src=amiga_power/magscans/ap12_1992_04/074.jpg&c=95377&n=1&filesize=393317 Amiga Format 1992] abime.net</ref>
