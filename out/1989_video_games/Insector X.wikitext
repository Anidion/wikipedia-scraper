{{nihongo|'''''Insector X'''''|インセクターX|Insekuta X}} is a [[scrolling shooter|horizontally scrolling shooter]] developed by Hot-B and released in arcades by [[Taito]] in 1989. It was ported to the [[Mega Drive]] and [[Famicom]].

==Gameplay==
The player controls an insect-sized warrior named "Kai" (named "Yanmer" in the arcade version), who takes on a vast army of cyborg insects to free the insect world from the dark ruler queen. The game uses two buttons: one for an upgradable main shot, and another for a seemingly random selection of secondary weapons.

Hot-B converted ''Insector-X'' to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] for Taito with minor changes, as well as their own revised version for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive]]. The original arcade version is included in ''[[Taito Legends 2]]''.

The Mega Drive version has a number of differences: "realistic" sprite work (compared to the "cute" style of the original), brand new music, a reworking of the secondary weapon system, the removal of the autofire powerup, and new stage sections, among other things. Hot-B's original design for the game was better realized on the Mega Drive, as Taito requested a more comical style of game for the original release.<ref name="STGv5">{{cite magazine|title=『オーバーホライゾン』開発者: 佐武義訓氏|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=5|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=31 May 2012|pages=94–96|lang=ja|ISBN=978-4896373899}} ([http://shmuplations.com/yoshinorisatake/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012120706/http://shmuplations.com/yoshinorisatake/|date=2019-10-12}}).</ref> It was published in Japan by Hot-B themselves, and in the United States by Sage's Creation.
