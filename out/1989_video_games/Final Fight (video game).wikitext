{{Nihongo foot|'''''Final Fight'''''|ファイナルファイト|Fainaru Faito|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a side-scrolling [[beat-'em-up]] video game developed by [[Capcom]] and originally released as an [[arcade game]] in 1989, and it is the seventh title released for the [[CP System]] hardware. Set in the fictional Metro City, the player controls one of three street fighters: former pro wrestler and city mayor [[Mike Haggar]], expert brawler [[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody Travers]], and modern-day ninja [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]]. The trio set out to rescue Jessica (Haggar's daughter and Cody's girlfriend) when she is kidnapped by the Mad Gear Gang.

The game began development as a sequel to the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' released in 1987, under the working title {{nihongo foot|'''''Street Fighter '89''''',|ストリートファイター'89|Sutorīto Faitā '89|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} but the genre was switched from a [[fighting game]] to a beat 'em up and the title was changed to ''Final Fight'' following the success of ''[[Double Dragon (video game)|Double Dragon]]''. ''Final Fight'' was ported to various home computers and consoles, including the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Super NES]] and [[Sega CD]].

It became a major commercial success in arcades, selling 30,000 arcade units worldwide while becoming the highest-grossing [[1990 in video games|arcade game of 1990]] in Japan and the year's highest-grossing arcade conversion kit in the United States. The Super NES version also sold {{nowrap|1.5 million}} cartridges worldwide. It spawned the ''[[Final Fight]]'' series, followed by several sequels. Its development team later worked on the original ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', and some of the characters from ''Final Fight'' later appeared as playable fighters in other entries of the franchise, such as the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]'' sub-series.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Final Fight gameplay.png|thumb|left|[[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody]] and [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]], both at left, seen at the start of the game's first level. Cody wears jeans and a T-shirt; Guy wears a sleeveless orange [[keikogi]].]]

''Final Fight'' can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: [[Mike Haggar|Haggar]], [[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody]], and [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]]. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.

The controls for ''Final Fight'' consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons, one each for attacking and jumping. By entering different combinations of joystick moves and button presses, the player can perform a variety of attacks:

* A flurry of standing punches/kicks
* A jumping forward kick
* A downward-directed jumping attack that can stun the enemy
* A grab at the enemy, allowing the player to either deliver further strikes or throw/slam them to the ground
* A spinning attack, which knocks down all enemies in the vicinity but drains a portion of the player's health

Obstacles such as barrels, trash cans, and oil drums can be broken open to reveal weapons (pipes, swords, knives), health-restoring food, and items awarding bonus points; these can be picked up by standing over them and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too many times or when the player moves to a new area. If the player is carrying a weapon, they will drop it upon picking up a new one.

''Final Fight'' consists of six stages or "rounds", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway; most rounds feature more than one section, and all have a time limit. The player confronts a [[boss (video games)|boss character]] at the end of each round, culminating in a fight against gang leader Belger in the sixth and final round. 

One life is lost whenever the player runs out of either health or time. The game ends when all lives are lost, but the player may spend a credit to continue from that point and choose a different character if desired.

==Plot==
The game is set in a fictional city on the Atlantic coast in the [[United States]] named Metro City (analogous with [[New York City]]). According to the game's intro, in the 1990s (or 1989 in the Japanese version), the city's crime rate reached alarming levels, but since the election of pro wrestler turned politician [[Mike Haggar]] as the new Mayor, Metro City was changed and cleaned up drastically. Under his term, Haggar managed to suppress the crime rate of the city to its lowest points. While the citizens of Metro City were thankful for Haggar's hard work in curbing crime, the Mad Gear Gang, who had served as the dominant criminal organization of Metro City, would not go down so easily. Under the leadership of the crooked businessman Belger, the group attempted to bribe Haggar with a large payoff to keep him from going after them, to which Haggar refused. Still determined to bring Haggar under their rule like the last mayor before him, Mad Gear proceeded to kidnap his daughter Jessica and create further unrest among the citizens. When Haggar finds out about his daughter's abduction, he becomes furious and decides to take his fight against Mad Gear to a personal level. Seeking additional manpower, Haggar recruits [[Cody Travers]]: an expert fighter and Jessica's boyfriend, as well as [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]]: a ninja in training and Cody's good friend/rival. The three dedicate themselves to the complete eradication of the Mad Gear Gang, and to rescue Jessica from their clutches.

The game gained notoriety for its unique continue screen, where the player character is shown tied to a chair with a lit bundle of dynamite on the table in front of him; the character struggles to escape as the 10-second time limit counts down. If the player activates the continue option, a knife falls from the ceiling and cuts the fuse.

==Development==
The game was designed by [[Akira Nishitani]],<ref name="AkiraN">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|page=52|issue=37|date=March 2007|title=The Making of Final Fight|author=Staff|url=https://vebuka.com/print/170218151255-bbe820ac9bedd06dfd0c922a6a2d3917/Retro_Gamer_n_037}}</ref> and produced by [[Yoshiki Okamoto]].<ref name="capcomking">{{cite web|url=http://www.videogames.com/features/universal/okamoto/okfinal.html|title=VideoGameSpot's Interview with Yoshiki Okamoto|last=Kent|first=Steven|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990223191246/http://www.videogames.com/features/universal/okamoto/okfinal.html|archive-date=February 23, 1999|url-status=dead|access-date=21 September 2021}}</ref> When coming up with the game's concept, Okamoto cited the arcade game ''[[Double Dragon II: The Revenge]]'' (1988) as his basis for ''Final Fight''.<ref name="capcomking"/> The game was originally shown at trade shows under the title of ''Street Fighter '89''.<ref name="sf89">{{cite web |title=Video Game Flyers: Capcom Concept Cabinet, Capcom (Japan) |url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=4155 |website=The Arcade Flyer Archive |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024115855/http://www.arcadeflyers.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=4155&image=4 |archive-date=October 24, 2007 |access-date=21 September 2021}}</ref> According to Okamoto, the sales division of Capcom originally requested a ''Street Fighter'' sequel, so his team decided to promote ''Final Fight'' as a ''Street Fighter'' sequel at trade shows (going as far to refer to one of the main characters as a "former Street Fighter").<ref name="capcomking"/><ref name="RePlay">{{cite magazine |title="A Real Winner" – operators are the real winners with Capcom's 'Buster Bros.' and 'Final Fight' |magazine=RePlay |date=January 1990 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=32, 34 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-14-issue-no.-4-january-1990-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2014%2C%20Issue%20No.%204%20-%20January%201990/page/32}}</ref> The title was changed to ''Final Fight'' before its official release after feedback from operators stating that the game was nothing like ''Street Fighter''.<ref name="capcomking"/>

According to the developers, they were originally planning to have [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] and [[Ken Masters]] from the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' as the playable protagonists, but that idea was scrapped for a new plot and new settings, involving the kidnapping of an attractive young woman by a city gang.<ref name="Capcom_Classics_Collection">{{cite video game|title = [[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection Volume I]]|developer = [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]]|publisher = Capcom|date=2005-09-27|access-date=2011-03-12|level = Final Fight Design and History Extras}}</ref> Capcom's president wanted the team to develop the game as if it was a [[film]], so he made the team watch a number of films.

The street gang the player faces in the game, the Mad Gear Gang, takes their name from the 1987 overhead [[racing game]] ''Mad Gear'' by Capcom; the game was released as ''[[List of Capcom games: E–L|Led Storm]]'' outside Japan.<ref name=ledstorm>{{cite web|url=http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=791|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319105405/http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=791|archive-date=2008-03-19|title=System 16 - 68000 Based Hardware (Capcom)|url-status=live}}</ref> Many of the characters are named after 1980s [[rock musician]]s such as [[Axl Rose]] (Axl), [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] (Slash), [[Gene Simmons]] (Simons), [[Sid Vicious]] (Sid), [[Billy Idol]] (Billy), [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]] (Abigail, named after King Diamond's [[Abigail (album)|second album]], also dons facepaint similar to King Diamond's), [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] ([[Sodom (Street Fighter)|Sodom]]), [[Roxy Music]] (Roxy), [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] (Damnd) and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] (Poison),<ref name="AkiraN"/> with another, 2P (Two.P), being from the Capcom game ''[[Forgotten Worlds]]''. Hugo Andore, another notable enemy character, is based on [[André the Giant]]. Because Capcom believed that "players would feel bad beating up a woman", they noted in the manual that the female opponent [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]] was a "[[Trans woman|newhalf]]".<ref name=GamesRadar>{{cite news|last1=Greer|first1=Sam|title=Queer representation in games isn't good enough, but it is getting better|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/queer-representation-in-games-isnt-good-enough-but-it-is-getting-better/|access-date=9 November 2018|work=GamesRadar|date=15 May 2018}}</ref>

The soundtrack was the work of seven sound composers: [[Manami Matsumae]], Yoshihiro Sakaguchi, [[Harumi Fujita]], Junko Tamiya, [[Yasuaki Fujita]] (in his first work for Capcom), Hiromitsu Takaoka and [[Yoko Shimomura]]. Despite this, Sakaguchi is the only composer credited in the game (as "Youkichan's Papa"). The other six were confirmed as having worked on ''Final Fight'' in 2014 when the Clarice Disk imprint of City Connection released the ''Final Fight Original Sound Collection'', which featured the original soundtracks to the three original ''Final Fight'' games and its accompanying ports.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vgmdb.net/album/48731|title = CDGM-10026 &#124; Final Fight Original Sound Collection - VGMDB}}</ref>

In a 2007 interview, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' magazine asked Akira Nishitani about the game's similarities to the 1984 film ''[[Streets of Fire]]''. Nishitani said that, at the time, the team were not "aware of ''Streets of Fire'', but I've [[Googled]] it and there does indeed seem to be something familiar about it" but that "this style of story was very popular back then" and many "fighting games made use of it" so "I guess we were part of that crowd!"<ref name="AkiraN"/> Despite these claims, the official interview in the Japanese book "How to Make Capcom Fighting Characters" ( ストリートファイター キャラクターメイキング ) released in 2018 has Nishitani explaining that during development his boss K.Tsujimoto asked him literally to watch "all the movies" by Walter Hill, especially ''Streets of Fire'' referred to by fellow developer Akiman (Akira Yasuda) in the same conversation. The movies were viewed on 3 different monitors at the same time as they "lacked time", then he literally "cut and pasted" movie stills in the specially dedicated "Video Materials Room". Also, when asked if ''Streets of Fire'' was the main influence giving the impression of being in "Downtown New York" in ''Final Fight'', Akiman replied positively.<ref name="ff-interview">{{cite web |title=Final Fight Developer's Interview |accessdate=2023-05-07 |date=2019-02-08 |url=https://game.capcom.com/cfn/sfv/column/132673 |website=[[Capcom]]}}</ref><ref>How To Make Capcom Fighting Characters: Street Fighter Character Design; publisher: ボーンデジタル(November 30, 2018); {{ISBN|978-4862464323}}</ref> Other sources of inspiration included ''[[Les Misérables]]'', namely the protagonist Jean Valjean who becomes a mayor in the latter half of the story and his role as a devoted father,<ref>{{cite book |title=Undisputed Street Fighter: The Art And Innovation Behind The Game-Changing Series |page=257 |publisher=[[Dynamite Entertainment]] |last1= Hendershot |first1=Steve |last2=Lapetino |first2=Tim |isbn=9781524104696 |date=2017-11-15}}</ref> and the manga series ''[[Mad Bull 34]]'', which influenced Haggar's appearance.<ref name="ff-interview"/>

==Home versions==

===Super NES (''Final Fight'' and ''Final Fight Guy'')===
[[File:Sid and Roxy in Final Fight.PNG|thumb|Roxy and [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]] (first two from left), as depicted in the Japanese Super Famicom port, were replaced with Sid and Billy (third and fourth) in the international SNES versions of the game.]]

A port of ''Final Fight'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] was released as a launch title for the platform in Japan in 1990 and later in [[North America]] in 1991 and then in the [[PAL region]] in 1992. It was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in 2007 and the [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console in 2013. The SNES port removed the two-player co-op option, the Industrial Area level and playable character Guy. Most of the scene transitions were also edited out. In the arcade version, the player characters would be seen exiting the levels and breaking through doors unlike the SNES version. Due to hardware limitations the SNES version could only display two or three enemies on-screen, in contrast to the CPS arcade version, which could display up to nine or ten enemies on-screen; to make up for this difference, the SNES version features more stopping points than the arcade version and the enemy placement is vastly different.

The English localization of the SNES port was censored for its content and features several differences from its Japanese Super Famicom counterpart: the first two bosses, Damnd and Sodom, were renamed Thrasher and Katana respectively; Belger's wheelchair was redrawn to look like an office chair; Poison, a woman with pink hair, and Roxy, a woman with red hair,<ref>{{cite video game|title=Final Fight|developer=Capcom|platform=Super Famicom|language=ja|level=[http://www.videogameden.com/sfc/extra/fif.pdf Instruction manual, page 25]}}</ref> were replaced with two male enemies named Billy and Sid;<ref name=gameover_page225>{{cite book|title=Game Over|last=Sheff|first=David|year=1993|author-link=David Sheff|page=[https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/225 225]|publisher=Random House|quote=With Capcom USA, Phillips's team edited some of the grislier games that came in from its Japanese parent company, although Capcom's own censors weeded out the most offensive touches... When a Capcom USA representative suggested that it was tasteless to have the game's hero beat up a woman, a Japanese designer responded that there were no women in the game. 'What about the blonde named Roxy?' the American asked. The designer responded, 'Oh, you mean the transvestite!' Roxy was given a haircut and new clothes.|isbn=0-679-40469-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/225}}</ref> all alcoholic references were removed, with two health-recovering items replaced; the line "Oh! My God", spoken by an enemy when his car is destroyed during the first bonus stage, was changed to "Oh! My Car"; the blood splash effect shown when a character is stabbed was replaced by a generic explosion;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://choujin.50webs.com/japanvsusa/finalfight.htm|title=日米ファイナルファイト比較|publisher=Choujin.50webs.com|access-date=2015-04-09}}</ref> and some of the darker skinned enemy characters were given lighter skin tones. The original soundtrack was ported for the Super NES by Toshio Kajino (credited as "Bull").

A revised edition of the SNES port, titled '''''Final Fight Guy''''', was released in Japan in 1992. This version replaced Cody with Guy as a selectable character (with a new opening and ending sequence explaining Cody's absence), included four difficulty settings, and added other new features such as two new [[power-up]]s, although the Industrial Area stage and the Two-Player mode were still omitted. An American version of the game (featuring the same changes in the localization as in the first game) was released in June 1994 as a rental-only game that was initially available at [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster stores]], although it was later given a limited release.<ref name=npv60p112>{{cite magazine|magazine=Nintendo Power|title=Pak Watch Update|page=112|volume=60|date=May 1994}}</ref> Kajino's music port was retained for that version.

===U.S. Gold versions===
[[U.S. Gold]] released ports of ''Final Fight'' for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] for the [[Europe]]an market in 1991. These ports were developed by Creative Materials. In February 1993, the ZX Spectrum version was released as part of the ''Super Fighter'' compilation with ''[[Pit Fighter]]'' and ''[[WWF WrestleMania (1991 video game)|WWF WrestleMania]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/superfightercomp.htm|title=Super Fighter|publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk|access-date=2012-11-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813035734/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/superfightercomp.htm|archive-date=2012-08-13}}</ref>

===X68000===
The [[Sharp X68000]] version was released by Capcom exclusively in Japan on July 17, 1992. This version is a relatively close conversion of the arcade game, with the only notable changes being different music (with a choice between a [[MIDI]] soundtrack and one using the X68000's internal sound chip) and a lower maximum on-screen enemies. The game came packaged with a CD soundtrack with all new remixed tunes.

===Mega-CD/Sega CD (''Final Fight CD'')===
The Mega-CD/Sega CD version, titled ''Final Fight CD'', was ported by A Wave and published by [[Sega]] under license from Capcom in 1993. This version retains nearly all the features of the arcade game that were removed in the two SNES ports (namely the two-player mode, the Industrial Area stage and the ability to play as any of the three main characters) and adds [[voice acting]] to the game's opening and ending sequences, an [[arrangement|arranged]] version of the original soundtrack, and an exclusive time attack mode. However the maximum number of on-screen enemies were still lower than the arcade version and the combo attacks of Cody and Guy are much slower. Furthermore, the graphics suffered from a more limited color palette, as well as fewer background details. Like the SNES version, the Mega-CD version was censored for the English localization with many of the same changes. Poison and Roxy were kept, but were redrawn with less revealing clothing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finalfight.classicgaming.gamespy.com/FFsegaregional.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207201450/http://finalfight.classicgaming.gamespy.com/FFsegaregional.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-02-07|title=Final Fight CD regional differences - Final Fight Online|publisher=Finalfight.classicgaming.gamespy.com|access-date=2012-11-24}}</ref>

===Game Boy Advance (''Final Fight One'')===
The [[Game Boy Advance]] version that was developed by Sun-Tec, titled ''Final Fight One'', was released in 2001. ''Final Fight One'' features all three characters and the Industrial Area stage that was missing from the SNES version. The 2-player cooperative mode is also featured via [[Game Link Cable|link cable]]. Dialogue scenes prior to each boss battle have been added and the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'' renditions of Cody and Guy are featured as hidden playable characters. Other unlockable features include alternate palettes for each player character and the ability for two players to use the same character. The character and background designs are lifted from the SNES versions rather than the original arcade version, with the enemy placement being similar to ''Final Fight Guy'', although the maximum number of on-screen enemies was increased and all the transition sequences were restored. The same new power-up items introduced in ''Final Fight Guy'' are also present in this version, along with a new Cody doll item. The English localization of the game featured the same changes as the two SNES versions.

===''Capcom Classics Collection''===
''Final Fight'' is included in the 2005 compilation ''[[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and in the 2006 portable version ''Capcom Classics Collection Remixed'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game is emulated from the original CP System arcade version and features very little differences from the arcade game. The compilation includes tips, character profiles, an art gallery and a sound test as bonus features.<ref name="Capcom_Classics_Collection"/>

===''Final Fight: Streetwise''===
The arcade version is also included as a hidden bonus game in the 2006 game ''[[Final Fight: Streetwise]]'' for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. However, the emulation in this version was programmed by [[Ultracade]], rather than [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]] (the developers of ''Capcom Classics Collection'' series). The controls cannot be adjusted and the quality is lower than other emulated versions.

===''Final Fight: Double Impact''===
The arcade version of ''Final Fight'' was released in a two-in-one bundle titled ''Final Fight: Double Impact'', alongside the arcade game ''[[Magic Sword (video game)|Magic Sword]]'', released digitally for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. Added features include various graphic filters, including an arcade cabinet view; online drop-in multiplayer; an arranged soundtrack composed by [[Simon Viklund]]; and extra content such as concept art, fan art, [[Street Fighter (UDON comics)|''Street Fighter'' comic]] pages featuring ''Final Fight'' characters and the "Final Fight" episode of the [[Street Fighter (TV series)|''Street Fighter'' animated series]], which are unlocked by completing certain in-game challenges.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/final_fight_double_impact/b/xbox360/archive/2010/04/14/plenty-of-extras-bring-this-classic-brawler-back-to-life.aspx | title=Final Fight: Double Impact Review - Final Fight: Double Impact Review | magazine=[[Game Informer]] }}</ref> The game was ported and developed by [[Proper Games]] and released for Xbox Live Arcade for 800 Microsoft points and April 15, 2010, for PlayStation Network for $9.99.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/11/25/oh-my-car-capcom-porting-final-fight-and-magic-sword-to-xbla-a/|title=Joystiq - Capcom porting Final Fight and Magic Sword to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network|publisher=Joystiq.com|access-date=2012-11-24}}</ref> The PS3 version features a very restrictive [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] protection which circumvents the ability other PSN games have to be shared among several PSN accounts.

===iOS===
On September 15, 2011, ''Final Fight'' was released into Apple's [[iTunes Store]]. This version includes all three characters from the Arcade version, a multiplayer feature that can only be used with Wi-Fi and a special items where one can turn on Extra Lives, Super Special, and Meat Explosion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-fight/id459663198?mt=8|title=Final Fight on itunes|publisher=Itunes.apple.com|access-date=2012-11-24}}</ref> However, the game no longer became available after the latest iOS updates from Apple.

===''Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle''===
