'''''Psycho Fox''''' is a 1989 [[platform game]] developed by [[Vic Tokai]] and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Master System]]. In 1995, [[Tectoy]] localized the game in Brazil as {{Lang|pt|'''Sapo Xulé: Os Invasores do Brejo'''}}.

==Plot==
Among a group of fox priests who worship the Inari Daimyojin (Fox Deity), one evil fox named Madfox [[Daimyō]]jin infiltrated his way to the highest ranks and took over the shrine. After seizing power, Madfox corrupted the land and created hordes of creatures. One young fox (who would earn the name Psycho Fox) has been chosen by his fellow people to rid the land of this evil deity.<ref name="PsFox-Manual">{{cite book |date=1990 |title=Psycho Fox Manual |publisher=[[Sega|Sega of America]] |page=2}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The player takes control of Psycho Fox in this [[side-scrolling video game]]. Psycho Fox must get from the left-hand side of the level to the right-hand side of the level with many enemies in the way. He can use a [[Shinto]] stick to change into other characters/animals, namely a [[hippopotamus]], a [[monkey]] or a [[tiger]], each of which has its own special ability. The hippopotamus is slow and cannot jump very high, but can punch through special destructible blocks in the game world. The monkey can jump higher than the other creatures and the tiger can run faster. Psycho also has an ally named Birdfly, who can be used as armor or as a boomerang. If Psycho is hit while carrying Birdfly, Birdfly goes away and the player does not lose a life.
