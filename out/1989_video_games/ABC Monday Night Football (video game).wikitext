{{Nihongo|'''''ABC Monday Night Football'''''|ABCマンデーナイトフットボール|ABC Mande Naito Futtoboru}} is an [[American football]] video game named after the [[NFL on ABC|television broadcast of the same name]].

It was licensed by [[NFL on ESPN|ABC Sports]], but did not obtain an [[National Football League|NFL]] or [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] license, and as such contains fictional teams, such as the Indianapolis Rays and the Miami Sharks: despite this, the team colors mimicked their real-life counterparts.
