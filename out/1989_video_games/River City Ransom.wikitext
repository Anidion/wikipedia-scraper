'''''River City Ransom''''',{{efn|Originally released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'''''|ダウンタウン熱血物語|Dauntaun Nekketsu Monogatari|lit. ''Downtown Hot-Blooded Story''}}}} known as '''''Street Gangs''''' in [[PAL regions]], is an [[open world]] [[beat 'em up]] video game originally for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It is an English localization of ''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'' for the Famicom. The game was developed by [[Technōs Japan]] and released in Japan on April 25, 1989.

''River City Ransom'' is the third game in Technos' ''[[Kunio-kun]]'' series released for the NES, preceded by ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]'' and ''[[Super Dodge Ball]]''. Like its predecessors, the game underwent great changes in its storyline and visuals during localization to make it more palatable for Western markets. It was the first console game published by the developer's North American subsidiary American Technos.

[[Video game remake|Remakes]] have been released for the [[Sharp X68000]], [[PC Engine Super CD-ROM²|PC-Engine Super CD-ROM²]], and [[Game Boy Advance]]. The NES version was re-released for the [[Wii|Nintendo Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in 2007 and the [[Wii U|Nintendo Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] in October 2015. It was also released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] Virtual Console in PAL Regions on July 25, 2013, on November 14 in North America. It was released again with the launch of  [[Nintendo Switch Online]] on September 18, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/13/17856798/nintendo-switch-online-nes-games-list|title=Nintendo Switch Online has these 20 classic NES games|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=September 13, 2018|website=Polygon|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>

The plot follows high school students Alex and Ryan as they cross River City in an attempt to reach River City High and rescue Ryan's girlfriend Cyndi from the clutches of a villain called "Slick".<ref name="ignreview" /> Along the way, they battle gangs of students and their gang leaders, latter of which act as [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. In the original NES version there are nine gangs in total, with names such as "The Generic Dudes", "The Frat Guys", "The Jocks" or "The Squids". Gang members are distinguished by the color of their t-shirt; each gang has unique characteristics and attacking patterns.

The characters' effectiveness in battle is determined by their [[stats]] in combination with unlockable fighting techniques such as Grand Slam, Stone Hands, and Dragon Feet. These techniques are purchasable as books in shops throughout the city. Players can collect loot from defeated gang members,<ref name="ignreview" /> and these funds may be spent on various food items and spa treatments which serve to not only revitalize the player's stats, but may also permanently increase attributes like "Punch" and "Kick". The game has a [[Password (video games)|password]] system for saving and loading of the player’s character stats, skills, possessions, money, and defeated bosses.<ref name="ignreview" />

[[Image:Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari game cover.jpg|thumb|left|The Famicom cover artwork of ''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'']]{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2023}}
''River City Ransom'' is an English [[Internationalization and localization|localization]] of ''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari,'' the third title starring Technōs Japan's mascot character [[Kunio-kun|Kunio]] (and the first entry in the series where Kunio teams up with his rival, Riki). In addition to anglicizing all of the names and dialogue, the characters' sprites were redrawn to replace the [[Gakuran|Japanese school uniforms]] with [[t-shirts]] and [[jeans]]. In the original, the gangs are all students from different high schools, and many of its characters would reappear in subsequent ''Kunio-kun'' games (particularly those directed by Sekimoto and Yoshida).

The number of difficulty settings was reduced from three to two; the easiest difficulty setting was removed, and the Medium setting was changed to "Novice". An alternate version of the 2-player mode which disables [[Player versus player|player-versus-player]] damage was also removed. In addition to the password feature for keeping track of the player's progress, the Famicom version supports the [[List of Nintendo Entertainment System accessories|Turbo File]], a peripheral released only in Japan that allows the player to save and load their progress.

''River City Ransom'' was the first console game localized by Technōs Japan's U.S. subsidiary, American Technos, Inc. Although most of Technōs Japan's previous games were also released in North America, they were licensed out to other publishers. American Technos' second and final game would be ''Kunio-kun''<nowiki/>'s ''[[Crash 'n the Boys: Street Challenge]]''.

On February 20, 2020, an alternate localization called '''''Downtown Nekketsu Story''''' was released in North America. This version more closely resembles the Famicom version, being a direct translation of the original. It was released alongside other fully-translated ''Kunio-kun'' Famicom titles as part of the ''Double Dragon & Kunio-kun Retro Brawler Bundle'' for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo Switch]].

==Ports==
===X68000===
''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'' was ported to the [[Sharp X68000]], a Japanese computer platform, and released in April [[1990 in video gaming|1990]]. This version of the game, which was developed by SPS and published by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]],<ref name="sps"/> features several enhancements to the Famicom original, such as displaying three enemy characters on-screen instead of just two, slightly more colorful graphics, an expanded game world, and new items and special techniques for the player (including some that were only used by certain enemy characters in the Famicom version, such as the headbutt and the whirlwind kick). The new locations includes several new shops (such as a dojo) and the schools of each enemy gang, each featuring two new bosses. In addition to the player's regular stats, the player also has individual stats for all the special techniques their character has acquired. The more frequently a special move is used to finish off enemies, the stronger that particular move becomes. Unlike the Famicom version, the X68000 does not feature adjustable difficulty settings. The player can save and load their progress in one of ten save files provided by the game itself.

===PC Engine===
The [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine Super CD-ROM²]] version of ''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'', released on December 24, 1993, was published by Naxat Soft and developed by [[KID]], the same team that did the PC Engine versions of ''Nekketsu Kōkō Dodgeball'' (''[[Super Dodge Ball]]''), ''[[Double Dragon II: The Revenge]]'', and ''Downtown Nekketsu Kōshinkyoku''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mx-5/kid/kidlistpce.htm|script-title=ja:ＫＩＤゲーリスト（ＰＣエンジン）|language=ja|access-date=2008-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029105129/http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mx-5/kid/kidlistpce.htm|archive-date=2007-10-29|url-status=live}}</ref> This version features enhanced graphics, an arranged redbook soundtrack and fully voiced characters, with the voices of Kunio and Riki performed by [[Ryō Horikawa]] and [[Nobutoshi Canna]] respectively. The player's progress is saved in this version on the PC Engine's backup memory. The rest of the game is almost identical to the Famicom version.

===Game Boy Advance===
[[File:River City Ransom EX cover.jpg|thumb|North American cover of ''River City Ransom EX'' for the Game Boy Advance]]
A [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] version of the game, titled {{nihongo foot|''River City Ransom EX''|ダウンタウン熱血物語ex|Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari ex|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released in Japan on March 5, 2004 and in North America on May 26.<ref name="jpgbarelease"/><ref name="nagbarelease"/> This remake was developed by Million and published by [[Atlus]]. The most notable change from the original version is the loss of a true cooperative mode. Instead, the game can be played with an [[AI]]-controlled partner, and players may exchange the data of their own characters to fight alongside each other. The GBA version also includes a vast number of configurable options that can adjust game play on the fly, such as changing AI behaviour, the number of enemies in one map area, and shop item reshuffling frequency. The password system is replaced by battery backup, which allows saving up to 12 characters. Character's appearances, keystrokes for learned techniques, even enemy characters can be customized and saved using secret shop items. A saved game does not store story progress or reputation, but it does store the player's statistics, techniques, current items and money, player's name, and customized appearances. The player can gain additional computer-controlled allies and form a "posse" who helps the player on his adventure. Some of these boss characters are from the original NES version, while others are taken from later ''Downtown Nekketsu'' games. The player can be accompanied by up to three AI-controlled partners.

===Digital ports===
Many years after the original NES version was released, it was digitally ported to four more Nintendo systems: the [[Wii]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch]]. The game has also been digitally released on [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]].

The first digital port of ''River City Ransom'' was released on the Wii [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on October 23, 2007,<ref name="jpvcrelease">{{cite web|author=Fletcher, JC|date=October 23, 2007|title=VC Tuesday: Best week ever|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/10/23/vc-tuesday-best-week-ever/|publisher=Joystiq|access-date=2011-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019124404/http://www.joystiq.com/2007/10/23/vc-tuesday-best-week-ever/|archive-date=October 19, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> in PAL regions on February 21, 2008,<ref name="palvcrelease">{{cite web|author=Calvert, Darren|date=February 21, 2008|title=EU VC Releases - 22nd February - Street Gangs|url=http://vc.nintendolife.com/news/2008/02/eu_vc_releases_22nd_february_street_gangs|website=Nintendo Life|access-date=2011-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723221853/http://vc.nintendolife.com/news/2008/02/eu_vc_releases_22nd_february_street_gangs|archive-date=July 23, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> and in North America on April 21.<ref name="navcrelease">{{cite news|title=River City Ransom and Phantasy Star III Now Available on Wii Shop Channel!|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/5tTAdRLSK64NoFSfayQuZ9f9xfVKO1Dc|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]|date=April 21, 2008|access-date=2008-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426160747/http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/5tTAdRLSK64NoFSfayQuZ9f9xfVKO1Dc|archive-date=April 26, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The western NES titles, graphics, and storylines for the latter two releases were left intact.

Outside Japan, ''River City Ransom'' was not highly successful when initially released. However, due to its unique gameplay and sense of humor, it is today considered a [[Cult video game|cult classic]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} This [[cult following]], combined with the game's character and humor, inspired parallel works.

It initially received mixed reviews upon release. Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' reviewed the game under its original Japanese title of ''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'' and gave it a generally positive review, stating that it is a fighting game which skillfully incorporates RPG elements, scoring it 28 out of 40.<ref name="Fam">{{cite web |url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=5657 |title=ダウンタウン熱血物語 まとめ [ファミコン&#93; / ファミ通.com |website=Famitsu.com |access-date=2016-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312070019/http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=5657 |archive-date=2016-03-12 |url-status=live}}</ref> French magazine ''[[:fr:Player One|Player One]]'' reviewed the game under its European localised title of ''Street Gangs'' and gave it a highly positive review, concluding that it is not to be missed and scoring it 93%.<ref name="player1">''[[:fr:Player One|Player One]]'', issue 23 (September–October 1992), [http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=32&num=1405&album=oui pages 86-87] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530081755/http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=32&num=1405&album=oui |date=2015-05-30}}</ref> UK television programme ''[[GamesMaster]]'' generally panned ''Street Gangs'', with one reviewer saying he "would rather sit in a vat of horse manure than play this game, give it to your worst enemies", with an overall score of 32%.<ref name="gmaster">''[[GamesMaster]]'', Episode 14 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huo90uhLsfg#t=6m45s Series 2, Episode 4] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330220844/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huo90uhLsfg#t=6m45s |date=2016-03-30}}), 22/10/1992</ref>

==Legacy==
The Japanese version, ''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'', was considered highly successful and would be followed by several spin-offs (including seven subsequent Famicom installments) until Technos Japan's closure in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. Of these seven games, ''Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki dayo Zen'in Shugo'' features the same gameplay system as ''Monogatari'', with the main difference being that the characters are re-enacting a [[jidaigeki]] play.

In 1994, a prequel was released for the [[Super NES]] titled ''[[Shin Nekketsu Kōha: Kunio-tachi no Banka]]''.

In 2002, an aspiring game designer, tester for [[Atari]], and longtime fan of the game obtained the title's trademark and began work on a sequel aptly titled ''River City Ransom 2''. The project was halted when it was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in 2003 that ''River City Ransom EX'' was to be released the following year.<ref>{{cite web | first=Frank | last=Cifaldi | year=2004 | title=Realize Games' River City Ransom 2 | url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200402/200402-rcr.shtml | work=Lostlevels.org | access-date=June 21, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615120020/http://www.lostlevels.org/200402/200402-rcr.shtml | archive-date=June 15, 2006 | url-status=live}}</ref> A true sequel to the game, {{nihongo|''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari 2''|ダウンタウン熱血物語2}}, was developed by Miracle Kidz for a Japanese release on [[WiiWare]] in 2011.

In 2013, the Canadian independent developer, Conatus Creative, began development on an officially licensed follow-up game, named ''River City Ransom: Underground'', originally scheduled for Windows in August 2014.<ref>{{cite web | title=River City Ransom Underground announced | url=http://conatuscreative.com/2013/04/river-city-ransom-announced/ |publisher=Conatus Creative | access-date=April 22, 2012|date=April 22, 2012}}</ref> In September, Conatus Creative launched a campaign on the [[crowdfunding]] site, [[Kickstarter]], seeking [[Canadian dollar|CA$]]180,000 in funding for the game. They successfully reached their funding goal, ending it on October 9, having collected $217,643, approximately 120% of the original goal. After years of development and negotiations with [[Arc System Works]] (which, as Technōs Japan's parent company, currently own the rights for the ''Kunio-kun'' franchise), the game was released on Steam for Windows, OS X and Linux on February 27, 2017.<ref>{{cite web | title=River City Ransom Underground launch date announced | url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/combitstudios/river-city-ransom-underground/posts/1797492/ | publisher=Conatus Creative | access-date=February 2, 2017 | date=February 2, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203162059/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/combitstudios/river-city-ransom-underground/posts/1797492/ | archive-date=February 3, 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref>

''[[River City: Tokyo Rumble]]'' was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] on August 8, 2013 in Japan, December 29, 2015 in Korea, and September 27, 2016 in the United States. ''[[River City Girls]]'', which was being developed by [[Wayforward]], was released on [[PlayStation 4]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Xbox One]], and PC on September 5, 2019.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1146468827678437376|user=WayForward|title=The gloves are off!
