'''''Pang ''''', originally released in Japan as {{Nihongo foot|'''''Pomping World'''''|ポンピング・ワールド|Ponpingu Wārudo|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} and known in North America as '''''Buster Bros.''''', is a 1989 [[action game]] released by [[Mitchell Corporation]] for [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1989. It was the tenth game released for [[Capcom]]'s [[CP System]] arcade hardware.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maciejewski|first1=A|title=Bustin It Up With The Buster Bros.|url=https://videochums.com/article/bustin-it-up-with-the-buster-bros|website=Videochums.com|date=26 March 2016|access-date=12 May 2016}}</ref>

The basic gameplay is identical to a 1983 Japanese [[MSX]] computer game called ''Cannon Ball'' (also released in 1983 on the ZX Spectrum as ''Bubble Buster''). ''Cannon Ball'' was made by Japanese publishers [[Hudson Soft]], and it was licensed by [[Mitchell Corporation]] six years later to make ''Pang''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers: Volume 1|publisher=SMG Szczepaniak|year=2014|isbn=978-1-5188-1874-5|pages=145}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Wiltshire|first=Alex|title=Japansoft: An Oral History|publisher=Read-Only Memory|year=2019|isbn=978-0-9575768-8-9|pages=264}}</ref>

In the game, players must finish a round-the-world quest to destroy bouncing balloons that are terrorising several of Earth's landmarks and cities. The fight to save the Earth begins on [[Mount Fuji]], [[Japan]], where the players must pass all three stages before moving on to the next location.

Conversions, all titled ''Pang'', were released across Europe by [[Ocean Software]] in 1990 for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Buster Bros. Screenshot.png|thumb|right|Arcade screenshot]]
There are 50 stages at 17 locations: [[Mount Fuji]], [[Guilin|Mount Keirin]], the [[Wat Phra Kaew|Temple of the Emerald Buddha]], [[Angkor Wat]], [[Uluru|Ayers Rock]], the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Barcelona]], [[Athens]], [[Egypt]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins, [[Antarctica]], and finally [[Easter Island]].

Each location has a unique background that shows the area's most famous landmarks. The [[Level (computer and video games)|stages]] contain a different layout of blocks, some that disappear after being shot, others that do not, and still others that are hidden and can reveal bonuses.

The stages start with differing numbers and sizes of balloons. The largest balloon divides for the first three times it is popped; after the fourth and smallest balloon is popped it vanishes. Each player starts with a single harpoon. When a balloon is popped, special weapons may drop down.

The other weapons include:
* Double Wire, a twin harpoon that allows two shots at once.
* Power Wire, a grappling hook that stays attached to the ceiling or block for a short period of time. This time can be decreased by rapidly pressing the fire button.
* Vulcan Missile, a high-caliber gun that works much like a machine gun allowing rapid shots.

There is no ammunition limit to any weapon. The names of the weapons differ between the monitor bezel (given above) and the game's [[attract mode]]. Other bonuses include:
* A force field that protects the player from one hit by a ball or enemy.
* An hourglass that slows the balls down.
* A clock which stops the balls for a short time.
* Dynamite that pops all of the balloons down to their smallest size simultaneously.

At a certain point in the stage, a food item will drop down that is worth several hundred (or thousand in the later stages) bonus points. These are different and of increasing value, until a 48,000-point cake slice is reached; thereafter the bonuses are all cake slices, alternating between 48,000 and 50,000 points.

If a player touches a balloon of any size, the player dies and both players must start the stage again.

When both players touch a balloon at the same time, only Player 1 will lose a life but this is somewhat offset because when both players reach a bonus or weapon simultaneously only Player 1 will get it.

Players start with 3-5 lives depending on the [[dip switch]] setting. Extra lives are also given when certain point totals have been accumulated. The stage ends when all of the balloons are successfully cleared. The game ends after all stages have been completed and our heroic duo ride their jeep into the sunset on an Easter Island beach.

In the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] version the Easter Island level has three stages instead of two and there is another location, Space, after it. There are 18 locations and 54 stages.

== Release ==
The arcade version was released by [[Mitchell Corporation]] in Japan and Europe. In Japan, it was called ''Pomping World'', and in Europe it was called ''Pang''. When the arcade version was released in North America and Canada by Capcom USA, the name was changed to ''Buster Bros''.

A [[TurboGrafx-CD]] version was released by Hudson Soft as ''Pomping World'' in Japan and as ''Buster Bros.'' in North America and Canada. A Game Boy version was also released by Hudson Soft, titled ''Pang'' or ''Buster Bros.''. The game was ported to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Amiga and Atari ST by Ocean Software, all titled ''Pang'' and only released in Europe. The Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC+/GX4000 conversions were available on cartridge only.
