{{nihongo|'''QBillion'''|キュービリオン}}<ref name="mobygames">[http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/q-billion ''Q Billion'' overview] at [[MobyGames]]</ref> is a [[puzzle game|puzzle]] video game for the original Nintendo [[Game Boy]]. It was released by [[SETA Corporation]] in 1990.

In ''QBillion'', you control a [[mouse]] that, for reasons that are left unclear, has to reduce stacks of blocks to units one block high.<ref name="mobygames"/> This is represented by a grid in which several squares have numbers, representing how many blocks are there.<ref name="mobygames"/> The player can move a single block around, or push a block down off a stack.<ref name="mobygames"/> However, to push a block the player must be standing on a block one level lower than the block - i.e. to push a block off the top of a three-block stack, the player must be standing on a two-block stack.<ref name="mobygames"/>
