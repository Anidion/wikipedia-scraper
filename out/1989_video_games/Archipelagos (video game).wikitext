'''''Archipelagos''''' is a 1989 [[first person (video games)|first person]] action and strategy [[video game]] developed by Astral Software and playable on [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[MS-DOS]].

==Plot==
The game takes place on a series of islands (the titular [[archipelago]]s). These islands were created by a mysterious race known only as the Ancients. The Ancients also created another race, the Visitors, who ended up being their downfall, as the Visitors rebelled against their creators, ultimately killing them. As the blood of the slaughtered Ancients soaked into the land, the worlds they had created became twisted and poisoned. This is the world the player now finds themselves in, with the task of restoring the islands to their former, uncorrupted glory.

==Gameplay==
[[image:Archipelagos in-game screenshot (Atari ST).png|thumb|left|The first level (Atari ST)]]
The game is played from a first person [[3D computer graphics|3D]] view. The player is not a specific character, but rather a kind of disembodied consciousness. Each level consists of a landscape made up of one or more lost islands. Each level has a stone [[obelisk]], a number of egg shaped boulders, and various hazards, such as animated trees, souls, or other enemies. The aim of each level is to destroy all of the boulders. Once all of the boulders are destroyed a timer starts. The player then has 90 seconds to reach the obelisk and destroy it.

Various obstacles stand in the player's way. There are animated trees which spread the blood of the ancients from their roots as they move around. Moving into an area contaminated by the blood damages the player. Also, once the timer has been started by destroying all of the boulders the trees become enraged, and swarm towards the player. Later levels introduce other creatures and hazards, but the essential [[gameplay]] remains the same throughout the game. As the game levels are [[procedural generation|procedurally generated]] from seed numbers there are 9999 levels in total.<ref name="zzap">{{cite web|url=http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/archipel.htm|title=CU Amiga and Zzap reviews of Amiga version of Archipelagos|accessdate=2007-12-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230105148/http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/archipel.htm|archivedate=30 December 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>
