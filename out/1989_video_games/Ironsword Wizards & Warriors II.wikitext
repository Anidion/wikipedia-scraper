'''''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II''''' (also known as '''''Wizards and Warriors II: Ironsword''''') is a [[platform game|platforming]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) developed by UK-based company Zippo Games, a subsidiary of [[Rare (company)|Rare]]. The game was published by [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] and released in North America in December&nbsp;1989 and in Europe on March&nbsp;27, 1991. It is the sequel to Rare's 1987 title ''[[Wizards & Warriors]]''. In ''Ironsword'', the player controls the knight warrior Kuros as he ventures in the land of Sindarin. He must defeat the evil wizard Malkil, who has assumed the [[elemental]] forms of Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water. Kuros must collect the parts of and assemble the legendary "IronSword" in order to defeat Malkil, who resides at the top of IceFire Mountain.

''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II'' was developed by Zippo Games' founder [[Ste and John Pickford|Ste Pickford]] and was the first game that he developed for the NES. Steve Hughes also assisted in development, while Rare's video game composer [[David Wise (composer)|David Wise]] did the music and sound. Pickford wanted to expand on the previous ''Wizards & Warriors'' game. Having experience with developing computer games, Pickford used various animation and graphics techniques to show off the NES's graphical capabilities. In addition, Acclaim hired Italian male model [[Fabio Lanzoni]] to pose as Kuros on the game's cover.

The game was fairly well-received, selling 500,000 copies in North America and 50,000 copies in Europe. Various video game magazines praised ''Ironsword'' for its size, graphics and sound, detailed characters and bosses, and gameplay. Other reviews criticized its lack of originality as compared to other games that were released at the time. The game led Zippo Games to develop additional games for Rare on the NES such as ''[[Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship]]'' and ''[[Wizards & Warriors III: Kuros: Visions of Power|Wizards & Warriors&nbsp;III: Kuros: Visions of Power]]''. ''Ironsword'' won "''Game Player's'' NES Excellence Award" from ''[[Game Players]]'' magazine as one of the better NES titles of 1990.

==Gameplay==
<!--General plot description/game overview, player controls-->
''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II'' is a [[platform game|platforming]] [[video game]] in which the player controls the renowned warrior Kuros as he explores the land of Sindarin to defeat the evil wizard Malkil. This time, Malkil has taken the form of the four "Elementals", based on the [[Greek elements#Classical elements in Greece|classical Greek elements]] – Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water – to stop Kuros in his quest. The objective is to assemble the legendary "IronSword"{{snd}} the only weapon that can defeat Malkil{{snd}} and defeat the evil wizard who lies at the peak of IceFire Mountain.<ref name="Manual">{{cite manual |title=''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II'' Instruction Manual |publisher=[[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] |year=1989 |id=NES-IR-USA}}</ref> In the game, players can move Kuros left or right, or make him crouch with the control pad; the buttons allow Kuros to jump, to use his sword or a magic spell to defeat enemies, to access the "Magic Spell Screen", or to pause the game. Kuros has a [[Health (gaming)|life meter]] that decreases every time he sustains damage from an enemy or a dangerous projectile, or if he falls for too long a distance. Along the way, players can collect chicken and brew to replenish Kuros's life meter. Kuros loses a life when his life meter runs out, and the game [[game over|ends]] when he loses all his lives. However, players may [[continue (video games)|continue]] and restart the game where they left off up to two times. The continue feature would normally be disabled after the player had completed the earth domain,<ref name="Manual" /> but due to an in-game bug, the player actually loses the continue function immediately upon merely setting foot in the domain.

[[File:Ironsword.png|thumb|left|Kuros battles the game's first boss, the Wind Elemental. In developing the game's bosses, [[Ste and John Pickford|Ste Pickford]] tried to fill as much of the screen and to use as few moving sprites as possible.]]
<!--Level layout, items/money-->
''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II'' consists of four [[level (video gaming)|level]]s called "domains," each named after the four elementals. In each domain, Kuros must find a golden artifact that belongs to the domain's "Animal King" and return it to him. Upon doing so, the path to the second part of the domain will appear. In the second part, Kuros must find the magic spell necessary to defeat the [[boss (video games)|boss]] – the domain's Elemental. Without the spell, it is impossible to damage the boss, or even remain in the room with him. Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed, Kuros obtains a piece of the IronSword, which is needed for the final battle on Icefire Mountain.<ref name="Manual" /> Throughout the game, players must collect items, spells, and money to progress. Money helps buy magic spells, more powerful weapons, shields, helmets, keys to open locked treasure chests, and additional food. Treasure chests{{snd}} located throughout the game{{snd}} can contain one of the following items: Additional money, magic spells, or weapon and armor upgrades. In each domain, players can visit inns where they can buy food, keys, or items; they may also participate in a "Bonus chance" game where they may gamble their money to see which cup a bouncing skull will fall into.<ref name="Manual" />

<!--Magic spells-->
In the game, magic spells help against enemies and Elemental bosses; some are bought, while others must be found. Magic spells include "The Familiar Spell," which turns enemies into money and helps retrieve golden objects, the "Dragon Tooth Spell," which turns enemies into food, the "Veil of Slumber Spell," which slows down enemies, the "Silver Fleece Spell," which makes Kuros temporarily invincible, and the "Water Spout Spell," which creates an upward column of water that allows Kuros to reach high places. Each spell has a limited number of uses before it vanishes from the player's inventory. Other magic spells are necessary to defeat the Elemental bosses. These spells are found in each of the four domains, and include "Windbane," "Blightwater," "Firesmite" and "Earthscorch." These spells can be used only in the corresponding levels in which they are obtained, and each consumes magic upon use. Players can obtain additional magic by collecting small, floating, gold bubbles that appear randomly<ref name="Manual" /> or are triggered by the player's proximity to secret locations.

Players may also increase their score by defeating enemies or collecting items. Hidden along the way are the "Relics of Sindarin," which are worth many points when collected; these consist of a book, cross, gauntlet, and ring. At the end of the game, players with a high enough score can place their names in the "IronSword Hall of Fame." However, the list resets when the console is turned off.<ref name="Manual" /> The game also includes a [[password (video games)|password]] feature in which players can obtain a password from the "Magic Spell Screen" to use to continue the game at a later time, even after the console has been turned off.<ref name="EGMreview" />

==Development==
''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II'' was developed by UK-based computer game company [[Zippo Games]], headed by [[Ste and John Pickford]]; this was the first game Zippo developed for fellow UK-based video game company [[Rare (company)|Rare]]. At the time, Zippo Games had just completed a previous game titled ''[[Cosmic Pirate]]'' - a game that was published by [[Palace Software]] and released for the [[Commodore 64|Commodore&nbsp;64]], [[Atari ST|Atari&nbsp;ST]], and [[Amiga]] in 1988. New to the technical capabilities of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the Pickford brothers visited Rare and were pleased with their NES library, though they thought they were backtracking by deciding to develop games for the console. According to Ste Pickford: "The NES seemed primitive by comparison, sub-Commodore&nbsp;64. But the games were ten times better than everything being released for home computers, which we appreciated, and we wanted to try to make games as good as that." Rare decided to hire Zippo Games to develop this ''Wizards & Warriors'' sequel; Pickford remarked: "Rare showed us ''Wizards & Warriors'' and asked us to develop the sequel, and pretty much left us to it." Rare felt that Zippo Games was trustworthy enough to develop the sequel without much help from them.<ref name="RetroGamer">{{cite journal |title=The History of ''Wizards & Warriors'' |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=[[Bournemouth]] |issue=81 |date=September 2010 |pages=54–59 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015}}</ref>

Development started in early 1989, when the Pickford brothers were still learning about the NES and what it could do. At the same time, as being new to developing console video games, they were also learning about the market aspects and [[Nintendo]]'s policies and restrictions on games. Feeling that the graphics in most of the games in the NES library were poor, they placed emphasis on the graphics and animation. Pickford was particularly pleased with the animation of the enemy eagles and their movement. Rare assisted with the sound, and all of the game's background music was composed by video game composer [[David Wise (composer)|David Wise]], who Pickford said "did a fantastic job on ''IronSword''".<ref name="RetroGamer" /> As far as gameplay was concerned, they tried to expand upon its predecessor, introducing more adventure-based gameplay and additional [[role playing game|RPG]] elements such as magic, inns, and money.<ref name="RetroGamer" />

===Graphics and animation===
Ste Pickford developed the gameplay map for ''Ironsword''. According to him, he basically copied the map that was used in a conversion [[porting|port]] of ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' that he developed a couple of years earlier.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pickford |first=Ste |title=''Ironsword'' Map concept art |publisher=Zee-3 |date=April 3, 2009 |access-date=April 9, 2011 |url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/blog/view.php?post=158 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929025439/http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/blog/view.php?post=158 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Moreover, the Pickford brothers were trying to resemble ''Ghosts 'n Goblins'' and similar games by [[Capcom]] as part of their attempt to earn the rights to develop the game from Rare. For the map screen, Ste Pickford used specific character data in the [[ROM cartridge|ROM]] itself, used the font from elsewhere in the data that was inserted separately, and [[Overlay (programming)|overlaid]] the Elementals' floating heads over the top of the graphic. According to Pickford: "The job of graphic was always about 30% drawing, and about 70% fiddly technical stuff (which was why so many terrible artists – people who couldn't draw at all – made decent video game artists back then, if they could manage the technical side of things well enough)."<ref>{{cite web |last=Pickford |first=Ste |title=''Ironsword'' Map in-game graphics |publisher=Zee-3 |date=July 14, 2009 |access-date=April 9, 2011 |url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/blog/view.php?post=258 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929025455/http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/blog/view.php?post=258 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In developing the game's graphics, Ste Pickford translated black and white sketches into the character maps in the game. For the bosses, the plan was to use the entire screen while involving as few moving sprites as possible "to fool the player into thinking the whole thing was alive".<ref>{{cite web |last=Pickford |first=Ste |title=''Ironsword'' Wind Elemental concept art |publisher=Zee-3 |date=August 18, 2009 |access-date=April 9, 2011 |url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/blog/view.php?post=293 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929025515/http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/blog/view.php?post=293 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The same was done with the "Dragon King", which was not one of the game's bosses; the dragon's head and neck were composed of sprites, while the rest of the body was considered part of the background. The dragon's neck stretched out vertically due to NES hardware sprite limitations horizontally.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pickford |first=Ste |title=''Ironsword'' Dragon King concept art |publisher=Zee-3 |date=August 18, 2009 |access-date=April 9, 2011 |url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/archive/view.php?post=116 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929025527/http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/archive/view.php?post=116 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The animation of the eagle (the "Eagle King") that transports Kuros to the Wind Elemental was one of Ste Pickford's first graphics which he drew for the NES. It was done in [[Deluxe Paint]] for the Amiga with sketching done by mouse - without assistance from [[graphics tablet]]s or other scanners. He took eagle drawings from a book on animals in motion by [[Eadweard Muybridge]]. Pickford wanted to show off the possible graphical capabilities of the NES; he said, "I wanted to do something 'flashy' early in the game, trying to show off my amazing graphic art skills on the rather primitive NES. We were working on Amiga and ST games at the same time, so were always trying to push the NES with bigger and better graphics, right from the start of our work on the machine." The eagle consisted of only three colors and between 11 and 17 sprites per frame of animation. There was a smaller version of the same eagle, which was used as a regular enemy in that level.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pickford |first=Ste |title=''Ironsword'' Eagle working |publisher=Zee-3 |date=January 8, 2009 |access-date=April 9, 2011 |url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/archive/view.php?post=72 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929025541/http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/archive/view.php?post=72 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Development of the game's title screen was inspired by [[loading screen]]s that were used in most computer games at the time; the objective was to create a nice-looking graphic while waiting for the game to load, even though the NES, more rooted in arcade traditions, did not require that. Pickford spent most of his character space on the title screen image; he was limited in the number of available colors due to the more limited graphic capabilities of the NES (as opposed to most home computers), as it was more designed for scrolling and animation and not for stationary graphics. The sword in the title screen used character sprites and used a different palette from the picture of Kuros himself; the sword had to be vertical as the NES hardware did not allow for too many sprites horizontally. Pickford planned to use, and completed, an ''Ironsword'' logo of his own when [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] made him use their planned logo, which he said "was a bit more bland and blocky, with detail that didn't work very well at such a low pixel resolution".<ref>{{cite web |last=Pickford |first=Ste |title=''Ironsword'' title screen working |publisher=Zee-3 |date=February 26, 2009 |access-date=April 9, 2011 |url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/archive/view.php?post=122 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929025552/http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/archive/view.php?post=122 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Release===
[[File:Fabio Lanzoni 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Fabio in 2014. For ''Ironsword''{{'}}s front cover, he posed bare-chested and without armor, which Ste Pickford found unsuitable for a game about a knight.]]
''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II'' was first unveiled in North America as part of the 1989 Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] and was displayed with other games to be released later that year by Acclaim.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Nester's C.E.S.

For the game's cover, Acclaim hired Italian male model [[Fabio Lanzoni]] to pose as Kuros; Fabio was presented on the cover bare-chested and without armor. When Zippo Games saw the image of the cover a week prior to its release, they were perplexed. According to Ste Pickford, "Our jaws hit the floor when we first saw this image (which was, being merely the developers, probably about a week before the game's release). Why on earth did they choose a photograph of a bare-chested barbarian to promote a game starring a knight in shining armour?".<ref>{{cite web |last=Pickford |first=Ste |title=''Irosnsword'' advert |publisher=Zee-3 |date=January 29, 2009 |access-date=April 9, 2011 |url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/press/view.php?post=94 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026051800/http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/press/view.php?post=94 |archive-date=October 26, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Pickford added that "We used it as an example of the lack of imagination of Americans", while suggesting that having an actual suit or armor would be too costly to use for a photo shoot.<ref name="RetroGamer" /> ''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II'' was released by [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] for the NES in North America in December&nbsp;1989<ref name="NintendoList">{{cite web|url=http://nintendo.com/consumer/gameslist/manuals/nes_games.pdf |title=NES Games |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |access-date=2008-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317023021/http://nintendo.com/doc/nes_games.pdf |archive-date=2007-03-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and in Europe and Australia in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II'' Release Information for NES |website=[[GameFAQs]] |access-date=April 9, 2011 |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587776-ironsword-wizards-and-warriors-ii/data |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227055534/http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587776-ironsword-wizards-and-warriors-ii/data |archive-date=February 27, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It managed to sell about 500,000 copies in North America and about 50,000 copies in Europe. Following the game's release, Zippo Games would proceed to develop its next game for Rare, ''[[Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship]]''; they would eventually also release the third installment in the ''Wizards & Warriors'' series, ''[[Wizards & Warriors III: Kuros: Visions of Power|Wizards & Warriors&nbsp;III: Kuros: Visions of Power]]''.<ref name="RetroGamer" />

The television advertisement consisted of a boy who is shown playing the first ''Wizards & Warriors'' game when a [[Conan the Barbarian]]-lookalike enters his room after having defeated a monster and hands him a copy of ''Ironsword''. After describing the brief plot and shortly showing clips of the game, the Conan-lookalike leaves his room while exclaiming, "The fate of the world is in your hands! Back vile beast!". At the end of the commercial, after briefly playing ''Ironsword'', the boy opens the door in his room, only to find his dog, who now has smoke coming from his behind.<ref name="RetroGamer" />

''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II'' was initially reviewed and received positive ratings in the June&nbsp;1989 issue of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''. Steve Harris said that the game was very large and expansive, noting that it "is so big, and has so much to offer, most of the competition pales by comparison". Ed Semrad called the game "a worthy sequel that fortunately is better than the original", similarly noting the game's size as well as difficulty. Donn Nauert appreciated the game's good graphics which complement the adventure theme, but he noted that some of the precise movements that are required in various areas may cause some frustration in gameplay. Jim Allee praised all the aspects of the game, saying "if you liked ''Wizards & Warriors'', you'll love ''Ironsword''". All four reviewers lauded the game's involving gameplay and graphics.<ref name="EGMJune89" />

The game would also be featured in the magazine's September&nbsp;1989 issue, in which it was named the magazine's "Game of the Month"; it also featured the game's box art, with Fabio, on the cover. The reviewers, the U.S. National Video Game Team, noted that the game was superior to its predecessor as well as other games released at the time, noting that it was particularly better than ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest|Castlevania&nbsp;II: Simon's Quest]]''. They praised its well-detailed and thought-out graphics, the inclusion of well-drawn out large bosses and supporting characters, the sound which "has an eerie tone that sets the mood for the whole game", and additional features which expanded upon the game's predecessor. They concluded that ''Ironsword'' was "one of the most welcome Nintendo Entertainment System games in a long time".<ref name="EGMreview">{{cite magazine |author=The U.S. National Video Game Team |title=Game of the Month - ''Ironsword'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |publisher=Sendai Publications |location=[[Lombard, IL]] |issue=3 |date=September 1989 |pages=46–48 |issn=1058-918X |oclc=23857173}}</ref> The game was also one of the featured games in the November–December&nbsp;1989 issue of ''Nintendo Power'', where it received six pages of coverage and featured a poster of the game.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=''Ironsword'' |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |location=[[Redmond, WA]] |issue=9 |date=November–December 1989 |pages=26–31 |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582}}</ref> ''[[Game Players]]'' magazine awarded ''Ironsword'' the "''Game Player{{'}}s'' NES Excellence Award" as one of the best games for the console in 1990.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Players World – ''Game Players'' Annual Awards – 1990 |journal=[[Game Players]] |issue=20 |date=February 1991 |page=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=Burlingame, CA |issn=1087-2779 |oclc=34042091}}</ref>

The game was also featured in UK-based magazine ''[[Mean Machines]]'' in May&nbsp;1991. Matt Regan said that he was not impressed with the game, saying that similar platforming games such as ''[[DuckTales (video game)|DuckTales]]'' and ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch (video game)|Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'' were superior to ''Ironsword'' and had a more original approach in gameplay. He also criticized the fact that players cannot hit enemies while in mid-air. However, he noted the game's good gameplay. [[Julian Rignall]] also said that the game was fun, but it was not spectacular. However, just as Regan noted, Rignall said that the game did not offer anything special like with better titles such as ''[[Mega Man 2|Mega Man&nbsp;2]]'' or ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2|Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;2]]''. However, he noted the game's good graphics and challenge, though both noted that the backgrounds "are slightly bland". Both reviewers said the game was well-presented with good introductions and a password mode, easy controls, fair challenge, and "fairly good tunes and effects which fit the action well". Overall, they said that ''Ironsword'' was "a fun but ultimately limited game that will appeal to platform fans".<ref name="MeanMachines" />

''Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II'' was listed at #64 in [[IGN]]'s list of "Top 100 NES Games". Reviewer Sam Claiborn said that the game was more expansive than its predecessor and that it featured many of the good graphics, gameplay, and usage of [[Middle English]]. He also noted that "Fabio's bare-breasted likeness smoldering on IronSword's cover art that made this game a smash hit with kids and moms alike".<ref>{{cite web |last=Claiborn |first=Sam |title=64.
