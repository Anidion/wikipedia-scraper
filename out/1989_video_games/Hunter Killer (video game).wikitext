Mike Siggins reviewed ''Hunter Killer'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it a rating of 1 out of 10 (a turkey), and stated that "As a guide, if I felt like wasting the time, I am sure I could knock out something approximating to ''Hunter Killer'' yet my programming skills are laughable. It really is that bad."<ref name="gi15">{{cite journal | last = Siggins |first = Mike | title =Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 15 | pages =44 |date=June 1990}}</ref>

''[[The Games Machine]]'' felt that the game was not as exciting as other submarine simulations, but advised that "If it appeals to you and you can't find ''Silent Service'' in a bargain bucket, get it."<ref name="TGM">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-31/page/n53/mode/2up|title=The Games Machine Issue 31|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

John Kennedy for ''[[Amiga Computing]]'' found the game to be "a worthwhile challenge at a remarkable price" and commented that "Suddenly I find I'd rather play this rather lo-tech game in preference to the latest scrolling shoot-'em-ups. Perhaps I'm getting old."<ref name="AmComputing">{{Cite web|url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_527_pages|title=Amiga Computing Volume 2 No 12 (May 1990) Page scans - Amiga Magazine Rack|website=amr.abime.net}}</ref>
