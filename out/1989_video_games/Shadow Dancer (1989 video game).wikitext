It is the second and the final arcade game in the ''[[Shinobi (series)|Shinobi]]'' series, following the original ''[[Shinobi (1987 video game)|Shinobi]]'' itself. The player controls a ninja aided by an attack dog, who is fighting to save the city from a terrorist organization.

''Shadow Dancer'' was the first game developed for the [[Sega System 18]] arcade board hardware,<ref>{{cite web |title=Video Game Flyers: Shadow Dancer, Sega (Japan) |url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=6344&image=1 |website=The Arcade Flyer Archive |access-date=19 September 2021 |archive-date=25 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325033926/https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=6344&image=1 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Leadership: Sega USA does it again with 'Line of Fire' and some hot kits |magazine=RePlay |date=January 1990 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=23–6 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-14-issue-no.-4-january-1990-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2014%2C%20Issue%20No.%204%20-%20January%201990/page/23}}</ref> and its generally well-received home versions were released for the [[Master System]] console and several [[home computer]] systems in 1991. A loose adaptation titled ''[[Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi]]'' was released exclusively for the [[Mega Drive/Genesis]] in 1990.

==Gameplay==
The play mechanics of ''Shadow Dancer'' are similar to these of the arcade version of the original ''[[Shinobi (1987 video game)|Shinobi]]''. The controls and almost all of the player's moves from the original ''Shinobi'' are present here as well.

The biggest change is the addition of a canine companion that follows the protagonist around. When the dog barks towards an enemy, the player can sic the dog on the enemy by pressing the attack button while crouching, allowing the player an opportunity to attack the enemy while it is being bitten by the dog. However, if the player takes too long to attack the bitten enemy or the enemy has a strong defense, then the dog will be hurt and turn into a harmless pup. The dog will then remain in pup form until the player acquires the next time bomb or finishes the stage.

The player's weapons consists of an unlimited supply of [[shuriken]] and a sword which is used when adjacent to an enemy. When the player collects half of the time bombs in each stage, stronger weapons are granted until the player finishes the stage or loses a life. The player can also use one of three random ninja magic (''[[ninpo]]'') techniques that will clear the entire screen of enemies. Normally, these techniques can only be used once per stage, but if the player continues the game by inserting more coins and pressing START, the protagonist restarts the stage with two units instead of one. Bonus points are awarded if the player completes the game without using shuriken or ninja magic.

There are four different missions, consisting of three stages for the first mission and four stages each for the remaining three. In the first few stages of each mission, the player must collect a certain amount of time bombs scattered throughout the stage in order to proceed to the goal. The final stage in each mission is a confrontation between him and one of four [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]es: an armoured giant throwing energy balls, a weaponized tank engine, a woman armed with a shield/weapon device, and a female ninja using magic and a [[naginata]] (the dog does not appear during boss battles).

Between each mission, there is a bonus stage [[minigame]] seen from the character's perspective as he tosses shuriken at enemy ninjas dropping down from a building. The player is awarded an extra life after successfully completing the minigame.

==Plot==
The young ninja battles together with his faithful pet dog. In the center of the city, a group of terrorists are committing every imaginable atrocity known to man, including the planting of time bombs throughout the metropolis. Our youthful hero and his canine companion courageously set out to gather all the explosives placed by the evil gang and annihilate the syndicate that manipulates them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=973&image=1|title=Shadow Dancer flyer|website=The Arcade Flyers Archive|access-date=2015-11-16|archive-date=2016-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114183444/http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=973&image=1|url-status=live}}</ref>

The protagonist is never actually named in the original arcade version, although the various home versions gives him differing identities. The manual and packaging description for the Master System version identifies him as Takashi,<ref name=smsmanual>{{cite web|url=http://www.smspower.org/Scans/ShadowDancer-SMS-EU|title=Shadow Dancer for the Master System packaging scan|website=SMS Power|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-date=2015-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033002/http://www.smspower.org/Scans/ShadowDancer-SMS-EU|url-status=live}}</ref> although the attract sequence in this same version contradicts this by naming him [[Fūma|Fuma]]. The manual for the home computer versions produced by [[U.S. Gold]], claims that he is [[Joe Musashi]] himself,<ref name=amigamanual>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=1425|title=Shadow Dancer manual transcript for the Amiga version|website=Lemon Amiga|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-date=2016-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114183444/http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=1425|url-status=live}}</ref> with one print ad for the game referencing Kato and Sauros (who were characters from the Genesis version).<ref name=amiga_ad>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/advert.php?id=952|title=''Shadow Dancer'' magazine ad by U.S. Gold|website=Lemon Amiga|access-date=2016-08-02|archive-date=2018-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922131617/http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/advert.php?id=952|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Release==
Following its debut as an arcade game in 1989, ''Shadow Dancer'' was released on various home computer formats in Europe in 1991. Versions released for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] were published by [[U.S. Gold]] and developed by Images. Some of these versions were re-released as budget titles by [[Kixx (U.S. Gold)|Kixx]] in 1993.

The [[Master System]] port was released in 1991 exclusively in Europe and Brazil. Although this version bears the title ''[[Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi]]'' on the packaging (like the Genesis version released in the same year), it is actually based on the arcade version and is simply titled ''Shadow Dancer'' in-game. Most of the content from the arcade version was cut and the play mechanics were modified a bit. Missions now consists of a single side-scrolling stage and a boss encounter. The player's canine companion no longer follows them around, but can still be summoned to kill certain enemies from a distance. Collecting time bombs is now an optional task that the player can conduct while on their way to the goal. When the player gathers all five time bombs in each mission, they will gain an attack power-up for the next boss battle. This version also features bonus stage minigames after completing each mission. While the minigame played after the first and third missions is the same as in the arcade version, the one after the second mission is new: it requires the player to throw shurikens at enemies while both them and the protagonist are in free fall between skyscrapers, and, unlike the other minigame, is played in a third-person perspective.

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed it on their January 1, 1990 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=371|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 January 1990|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>

''Shadow Dancer'' was well-received by critics upon its release in arcades. Sean Kelly of ''[[Zero (video game magazine)|Zero]]'' magazine said it was "a pretty impressive" ninja game with "a massive dog/wolf animal thingy that turns into a puppy every time it gets a good kicking" and that, despite being derivative of earlier ninja games (such as ''Shinobi'' and ''[[Dragon Ninja]]''), it was "good fun" to play.<ref name="Zero">{{cite magazine |last1=Kelly |first1=Sean |title=Arcade Expo: A.T.E.I.

The home conversions were also well-received. ''[[Commodore Format]]'' awarded this "wondefully playable", "highly polished and challenging game that no one can really afford to miss" a score of 89% upon its Commodore 64 release,<ref name="CF">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/commodore-format-magazine-07/Commodore_Format_Issue_07_1991_04#page/n35/mode/2up |title=Commodore Format Magazine Issue 07 |access-date=2015-06-20}}</ref> and the same score for its 1993 re-release,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/commodore-format-magazine-33/Commodore_Format_Issue_33_1993_06#page/n57/mode/2up |title=Commodore Format Magazine Issue 33 |access-date=2015-06-20}}</ref> while ''[[Zzap!64]]'' gave it 83%.<ref name="Zzap">{{cite web |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_1281_reviews |title=Zzap 73 (May 1991) Reviews - Amiga Magazine Rack |publisher=Amr.abime.net |access-date=2015-05-04 |archive-date=2015-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621023032/http://amr.abime.net/issue_1281_reviews |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' described the ZX Spectrum as an "impressive arcade conversion" and "pretty blimming marvellous"<ref name=cr/> and ''[[Crash (magazine)|CRASH]]'' called it "is a good scrolly beat-'em-up with arcade adventure overtones" that is "fast, tough and, above all, playable".<ref name=cr/> ''[[Amiga Action]]'' awarded the Amiga version of ''Shadow Dancer'' a review score of 84% and ranked it as the 19th best action game on the system.<ref name="AA">{{cite web |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_94_reviews |title=Amiga Action 21 (June 1991) Reviews - Amiga Magazine Rack |publisher=Amr.abime.net |access-date=2015-05-04 |archive-date=2015-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621032147/http://amr.abime.net/issue_94_reviews |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Raze (magazine)|RAZE]]'' gave the Amiga version of ''Shadow Dancer'' a score of 89%.<ref name="Raze">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/RAZE_Issue_09_1991-07_Newsfield_Publishing_GB#page/n37/mode/1up |title=RAZE - Issue 09 (1991-07)(Newsfield Publishing)(GB) |date=July 1991 |access-date=2015-06-20}}</ref>

''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' gave the Amiga version of ''Shadow Dancer'' an overall score of 80%, beginning their review by stating that "if first impressions were anything to go by, then ''Shadow Dancer'' would score very highly indeed ... Unfortunately first impressions don't rate very highly and the early promise soon fades". ''The One'' criticised the "annoying" lack of checkpoints in levels, and expresses that foreground sprites blend in with the game's backgrounds, "thus making the action a touch confusing". ''The One'' praised ''Shadow Dancer's'' graphics, calling it's backgrounds "noteworthy" and noting the game's large sprites as "reminiscent" of the arcade original, furthermore calling ''Shadow Dancer'' "deep" and "colourful". ''The One'' also praised the dog companion feature, stating that it "adds a novel strategic twist" to ''Shadow Dancer's'' gameplay.<ref name=theone>{{cite magazine|title = Shadow Dancer Review|date = June 1991|url = https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-33/page/n93|magazine = The One|publisher = emap Images|last = Watsham|first = Jools|issue = 33|pages = 86–87}}</ref>

On the other hand, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' in 2010 declared it inferior to the Sega Mega Drive's 1990 release ''Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi'', "let down by surprisingly stodgy controls, uninspired level design, and a really frustrating difficulty level".<ref>''Retro Gamer'' 77 (May 2010), page 66.</ref> In contrast, ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' considered the original ''Shadow Dancer'' arcade game to be superior to the Sega Mega Drive game ''Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi''. The game sold around 300,000 copies.<ref name="CVG">{{Cite web|url=https://segaretro.org/File:CVG_UK_111.pdf|title=File:CVG UK 111.pdf|date=October 22, 2021|website=Sega Retro|access-date=October 22, 2021|archive-date=April 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413234525/http://segaretro.org/File:CVG_UK_111.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>
