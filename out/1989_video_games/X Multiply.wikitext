{{nihongo|'''''X Multiply'''''|エックスマルチプライ|EkkusuMaruchipurai}}{{efn|The arcade flyer uses "エックス・マルチプライ" (therefore "X MULTIPLY"), while home console releases use "Xマルチプライ".}} is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] published by [[Irem]], and similar in style to their earlier ''[[R-Type]]''. In 1998, the game was released with ''[[Image Fight]]'' as a one-disc doublebill on [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]]. In 2019, the game was released on the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] as part of [[Hamster Corporation]]'s [[Arcade Archives]] series, marking its first official release outside Japan.

==Gameplay==
The game itself is a side-scroller like ''[[R-Type]]'', albeit with a short vertical-scrolling area towards the end of the sixth level. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002. [[Konami]]'s ''[[Xexex]]'' is based on a fusion of this weaponry with the Force system of ''R-Type''. In the PlayStation 2 game ''[[R-Type Final]]'', the ship "RX-12 Cross The Rubicon" uses the "Flexible Force", a Force based on ''XMultiply'' with roughly the same attacks.

==Plot==
The game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249—the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of a person who has been invaded by the alien queen.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''X Multiply'' on their November 1, 1989 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade game of the year.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=367|publisher=Amusement Press|date=1 November 1989|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>
