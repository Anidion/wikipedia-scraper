'''''Storm Across Europe''''' is a [[grand strategy wargame|grand strategy]] [[video game]] written by Dan Cermak and released for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1989 by [[Strategic Simulations]]. Versions for the [[Amiga]] and [[MS-DOS]] followed in 1990. The game covers [[World War II]] in [[Europe]] on a grand strategic scale between 1939 and 1945.

==Gameplay==
Three major powers are playable: [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] ([[Axis powers|Axis]]), the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. However, [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] cannot be played by the computer. In the game you are in charge of your chosen major power and its land, air and naval forces. You also control production and research of military equipment.

The map covers Europe, North Africa and Middle East and the Baltic, North Sea, eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean, Black Sea and Persian Gulf. The map covers 224 areas and 37 different countries. Each area has different terrain (affecting combat), and possible manpower, raw materials and industry (needed for production and research).

==Reception==
''[[Compute!]]'' stated that the Commodore 64 version of ''Storm Across Europe'' was "one of the best games of the year", approving of the game's strategic emphasis.<ref name="randall198912">{{Cite magazine |last=Randall |first=Neil |date=December 1989 |title=64/128 |url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_115_1989_Dec#page/n13/mode/2up |magazine=Compute! |pages=12,14}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave the game three stars out of five. The magazine stated that despite the "8-bit" graphics and user interface, ''Storm Across Europe'' might appeal to fans of ''Colonial Conquest'' and those looking for a strategy game they could complete relatively quickly; ''[[Clash of Steel]]'', however, "makes this embarrassingly unplayable".{{r|brooks199010}}<ref name="brooks199112">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=89 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: The 1900-1950 Epoch / Part II (M-Z) of an Annotated Paiktography | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
