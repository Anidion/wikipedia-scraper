In the February–March 1990 edition of ''[[Games International]]'', John Harrington commented that "the humour and atmosphere of ''Scapeghost'' kept me in good spirits." He concluded by rating the game a below average 6 out of 10, and the graphics a poor 5 out of 10, saying, "Hardened adventurers would probably not  find it too challenging."<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine|last=Harrington|first=John| date=February–March 1990|title=Scapeghost|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=13|pages=46}}</ref>

In ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' #97, Keith Campbell thought the storyline was "very original with some highly unusual puzzles based on the supposed characteristics of ghosts." He noted that the high level commands used by Level 9 made the game "a pleasure to play, and free from frustration even if a silly mistake is made." Campbell concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, "Despite the occasional glitch, I rank ''Scapeghost'' as Level 9's most enjoyable adventure."<ref name=cv97>{{cite magazine | last =Campbell | first =Keith | title =Scapeghost (Level 9 Computing) | magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]| issue =97| publisher =Future Publishing | date =December 1989}}</ref>
