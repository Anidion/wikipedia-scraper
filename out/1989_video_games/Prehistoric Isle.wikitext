'''''Prehistoric Isle'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''Genshi-Tō'''''|原始島||'''''Primitive Island'''''|lead=yes}} in Japan, and as '''''Genshi-Tō 1930's''''' and '''''Prehistoric Isle in 1930''''' on Japanese and Western [[title screen]]s, respectively.}} is a [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] originally developed and published by [[SNK]].<ref name="ATVGL:JaO1971-2005"/> Set during the [[1930s]], where ships at [[The Bahamas]] mysteriously disappeared, players assume the role of [[U.S. Marine]] pilots taking control of [[biplane]]s in a reconnaissance assignment at "Greenhell Isle", a fictional island inhabited by dinosaurs and creatures thought to be extinct. Headed by a [[Video game creative director|director]] under the pseudonym of "Yah!", the game was developed by most of the same team that would later work on several projects for the [[Neo Geo]] [[Video game#Platforms|platforms]] at SNK. Although first launched in arcades, the title has since been re-released through download services and [[Product bundling|compilation]]s for various [[Video game console|console]]s. It received positive reception since its initial arcade release from critics who praised the visuals, sound design, gameplay and originality. A sequel, ''[[Prehistoric Isle 2]]'', was released in 1999 for the [[Neo Geo MVS]] but garnered less success than its predecessor.

''Prehistoric Isle'' is a scrolling shoot 'em up game reminiscent of ''[[R-Type]]'' where players assume the role of U.S. Marine pilots taking control of biplanes, which are sent on a reconnaissance assignment through five increasingly difficult stages at "Greenhell Isle", a fictional island inhabited by dinosaurs and creatures thought to be extinct.<ref name="PHflyer">''Prehistoric Isle'' arcade flyer (SNK, EU)</ref><ref name="G34">{{cite magazine|author=Zenji|url=https://archive.org/stream/gamest0034#page/n112/mode/2up|title=紹介 - 原始島|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=34|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=July 1989|pages=106–107|lang=ja}}</ref><ref name="MBASICM84">{{cite magazine|last=Kenjō|first=Kōji|url=https://archive.org/stream/micomBASIC_1989-06#page/n227/mode/2up|title=Super Soft Corner: Video Game - 原始島|magazine=[[:ja:マイコンBASICマガジン|Micom BASIC Magazine]]|issue=84|publisher=[[:ja:電波新聞社|The Dempa Shimbunsha Corporation]]|date=June 1989|pages=288–290|lang=ja}}</ref><ref name="G35">{{cite magazine|last=Ishii|first=Zenji|url=https://archive.org/stream/gamest0035#page/n16/mode/1up|title=攻略 - 原始島|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=35|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=August 1989|pages=15–16|lang=ja}}</ref><ref name="AJARCph">{{cite magazine|last=Labiner|first=Michael|url=https://archive.org/stream/Amiga_Joker_1989-12_Joker_Verlag_DE#page/n75/mode/1up|title=Coin-Op|magazine=[[:de:Amiga Joker|Amiga Joker]]|issue=2|publisher=Joker-Verlag|date=December 1989|pages=78–79|lang=de}}</ref><ref name="PHhg101">{{cite web|last=Tiraboschi|first=Federico|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/prehistoric-isle-in-1930/|title=Prehistoric Isle|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=February 12, 2017|access-date=2020-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111143137/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/prehistoric-isle-in-1930/|archive-date=November 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The players control their plane over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] that must be fought before progressing any further is reached.<ref name="G34"/><ref name="MBASICM84"/><ref name="PHhg101"/> Players have only one weapon at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen's length.

== Synopsis ==
In the 1930s, ships that sailed near The Bahamas began to disappear mysteriously, with the [[United States]] and neighbor countries deciding to task an investigation team from the U.S. Marine to determine the cause. When surveying the ocean, the expedition crew comes across an uncharted land dubbed "Greenhell Isle" and launches two reconnaissance biplanes to examine further. During their research, the biplanes come under attack by dinosaurs and creatures thought to be extinct.<ref name="PHflyer"/><ref name="PHhg101"/>
