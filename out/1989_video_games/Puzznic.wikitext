{{nihongo|'''''Puzznic'''''|パズニック|Pazunikku}} is a [[tile-matching video game]] developed and released by [[Taito]] for [[arcade video game|arcades]] in 1989. It was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Game Boy]], [[PC Engine]], [[X68000]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] between 1990 and 1991. Home computer ports were handled by [[Ocean Software]]; the 2003 PlayStation port was handled by Altron. The arcade and [[FM Towns]] versions had [[Eroge|adult content]], showing a naked woman at the end of the level; this was removed in the international arcade release (but not the US one) and other home ports. A completed [[Apple IIGS]] version was cancelled after Taito America shut down.

''Puzznic'' bears strong graphical and some gameplay similarities to Taito's own ''[[Plotting (video game)|Flipull/Plotting]]''.
