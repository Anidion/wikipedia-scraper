'''''Vette!''''' is a 1989 [[racing video game]] published by [[Spectrum Holobyte]] for [[MS-DOS]] compatible operating systems in 1989. [[Macintosh]] and [[NEC PC-9801]] ports followed. The objective is to race a [[Chevrolet Corvette]] through the streets of [[San Francisco]]. The game uses a 3D, flat-shaded polygon rendering of the city, including landmarks such as the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the San Francisco [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]]{{r|scisco198911}}, and [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]]. It was released on three floppy disks in both a [[black and white]] and color version.

A [[Sega Genesis]] version was planned, but never released.<ref name="CGW68">{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:Megadrive_Fan_1991-04.pdf&page=117|title=Winter Consumer Electronic Show: Entertainment Software "On The Pass Line" - New Computer Games at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show — Making a Competition|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|issue=68|publisher=Russell Sipe|date=February 1990|page=42|lang=ja}}</ref><ref name="EGM13a1">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_Issue_013_August_1990#page/n88/mode/1up|title=Outpost: Genesis - 'Vette (Sega)|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=13|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=August 1990|page=86}}</ref><!-- most citations in one place. perhaps different citations could be placed elsewhere -->

At the beginning of the game, a question from the manual requires a correct answer to prove game ownership. If the question is falsely answered, the game can be played for a limited time before a window popped up claiming "You have been caught driving a stolen Vette!", followed by the game crashing.

==Development==
During the development of this game, the attack on protesting Chinese students in [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre|Tiananmen Square]] occurred. In memory of that event, one of the programmers snuck this string into the program executable: "IN MEMORY OF THOSE WHO WERE MURDERED IN TIAN-AN-MEN SQUARE ON JUNE 4, 1989. J.P. "<ref name=":0" />

==Reception==
Tony Dillon of ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' praised ''Vette!'' for its "complexity of design combined with clever simplicity in presentation" and its varied gameplay, and opined that the game "doesn't quite have the edge over ''[[Stunt Car Racer|Stunt Car]]'', but it sure isn't far behind."<ref name="ACE">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-26/ACE_Issue_26_1989_Nov#page/n49/mode/2up |title=Screentest: ''Vette!'' |magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]] |date=November 1989 |author=Dillon, Tony |page=50}}</ref> Peter Scisco of ''[[Compute!]]'' favorably reviewed the game, describing it as "''[[Falcon (series)|Falcon AT]]'' on the ground." He praised the game's detail and [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] graphics, only criticizing the lack of [[sound card]] support, and concluded that "''Vette!'' surpasses other driving simulations in its scope and realism".<ref name="scisco198911">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-11-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_114_1989_Nov#page/n85/mode/2up |title=''Vette!'' |magazine=[[Compute!]] |date=November 1989 |author=Scisco, Peter |pages=84–86}}</ref>
