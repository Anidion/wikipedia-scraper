{{nihongo|'''''Quarth'''''|クォース|Kwōsu}}, known as '''''Block Hole''''' outside Japan, is a hybrid [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]]/[[shoot 'em up]] game developed by [[Konami]] which was released in 1989 as an [[arcade game]]. Besides the arcade version, there were also ports of the game to the [[MSX|MSX2]] (with a built-in [[Konami SCC|SCC]] chip), [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]], and [[Game Boy]]—home releases used the ''Quarth'' name worldwide (with the exception of the Game Boy Color release in Europe of ''[[Konami GB Collection]] Vol. 2'', where the game was renamed to the generic title ''Block Game'' for unknown reasons).

''Quarth'' was released on the Konami Net [[i-mode]] service as ''Block Quarth'', with an updated ''Block Quarth DX'' in 2001. It was released without the "DX" suffix in 2005 and was made globally available through Konami Net licensing on many i-mode services offered by mobile operators. In Europe, for example, it was available from [[O2 (UK)|O2 UK]], [[O2 (Ireland)|O2 Ireland]], and [[Telefónica|Telefónica Spain]].

In 2005, [[Konami]] also included the game in the [[Nintendo DS]] title ''[[Ganbare Goemon: Tōkai Dōchū Ōedo Tengu ri Kaeshi no Maki|Ganbare Goemon: Tōkaidōchū Ōedo Tengurikaeshi no Maki]]''. An [[Video game console emulator|emulated version]] of the game was released in 2006 for [[PlayStation 2]] in [[Japan]] as part of the ''[[Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono]]'' series.

''Quarth'' is a combination of ''[[Tetris]]''-style gameplay and a fixed shooter in the ''[[Space Invaders]]'' tradition. The player's focus is on falling blocks, and the action is geometrical. Rather than arranging the blocks together to make a row of disappearing blocks, a spaceship positioned at the bottom of the screen shoots blocks upwards to make the falling block pattern into squares or rectangles. Once the blocks have been arranged properly, the shape is destroyed and the player is awarded points based on the shape's size. The blocks continue to drop from the top of the screen in various incomplete shapes. As each level progresses, the blocks drop at greater speed and frequency. There are also various power-ups which could be located to increase your ship's speed, among other bonuses.

The game continues until the blocks reach the dotted line at the bottom of the screen, whereupon the player's ship is "player's ship is "quarthed", crushed flat.

=== Multiplayer ===
The Arcade, [[MSX|MSX2]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] versions had two different 2-player modes: a split-screen mode with Player 1 on the left and Player 2 on the right, and a cooperative mode where both players shared the same screen.

For the Game Boy, multiplayer requires the Game Boy Link Cable with each player able to view only their fields on their own Game Boys.
