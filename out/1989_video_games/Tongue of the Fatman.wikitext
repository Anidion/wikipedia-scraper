'''''Tongue of the Fatman''''' (or simply '''''Fatman''''' for the Japan release)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/saturday-crapshoot-tongue-of-the-fatman/|title=Saturday Crapshoot: Tongue of the Fatman - PC Gamer|last=Cobbett|first=Ricfavorfavorfavorhard|website=[[PC Gamer]] |date=23 September 2011|language=English|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref> is a 1989 fighting game developed by [[Activision]] and published by [[Sanritsu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/tongue-of-the-fatman/pc-837329|title=Tongue of the Fatman - PC - IGN|language=English|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref>

The game is also renamed by the titles '''''Mondu's Fight Palace''''' on the [[Commodore 64]], and '''''Slaughter Sport''''' in its [[Sega Genesis]] iteration. The working title for the game was 'Red Belt'.

==Overview==

In single-player mode, players begin as any of the 3 races and must take on each of the 10 matches, facing off with each different race from left to right of the given list.<ref name=":1">Rivera, Michael. ''Powerhits Sci/Fi.'' 1992. Pg. 41-56. http://www.mocagh.org/activision/scifipowerhits-manual.pdf<.</ref> Afterwards, they must fight the game's main antagonist: Mondu the Fat, the champion of the fight palace and the last obstacle of the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue117/p90_reviews3_TONGUE_OF_THE_FATMAN.php|title=Review: Tongue Of The Fatman|last=Netsel|first=Tom|website=www.atarimagazines.com|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>

In the Genesis port, single-player mode centers on the player beginning as Rex (or as another fighter through cheat codes) and must take on each of the 8 standard fighters (including their mutant clone) twice, with the second set being the more difficult palette swaps.

==Characters==
The game gives the player ten races to choose from, each race having its own special moves. The original version of the game starts with the player having 3 species to choose from,<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=Lazy Game Reviews|title=LGR - Tongue of the Fatman - DOS PC Game Review|date=2012-09-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qngBXbs3Of0|accessdate=2017-11-26}}</ref> unlocking new characters by defeating them in battle. These 10 races includes:

===Original===
* Rex 
** A Humanoid
* Rubic 
** A CyberDroid
* Freezer 
** A Cryoplast
* Edwina
** An Amazoid
* Stump 
** A Bi-Husker
* Slasher
** A Rayzor
* Behemoth 
** A Mammath
* Puff Boy 
** A Puftian
* Colonoid 
** A Colonoid
* Mondu (final boss)
** A Celluloid

The single-player mode progression follows the above list in order. The Fat Man's special ability is the "Tongue Lash", where his belly opens and sprawls out a tongue tweak that jabs the enemy. Despite this being the final boss fight of the game, players have defeated Mondu in as little as 5 seconds.<ref>{{Citation|last=OtakuChest|title=Tongue of Fatman (1989) MS-DOS PC Game Playthrough|date=2012-10-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS8zDFFisDk|accessdate=2017-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Archmaster Champion|title=Tongue of the Fatman videogame (Cyberdroid)|date=2017-07-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msdCGApAkpk|accessdate=2017-11-27}}</ref>

===Genesis===
The Genesis version of the game features a different 17-fighter roster (eight of which are palette swaps):

* Rex / M.C. Fire
* Edwina / Sheba
* Guano / Weezil
* Bonapart / Skinny
* Robochic / Braniac
* Stump / Buff
* Ramses / El Toro
* Webra / Spidra
* Mondu (final boss)
Only Rex, Edwina, Stump, and Mondu are present in both versions of the game.

==Items==

In-game currency is earned after the completion of each match, and the money earned can be increased through wagering. The player starts off with $1000 to spend on items and wager with. Wagers placed are based on the time it takes for them to defeat their opponent, if players exceed the given time restraint they will lose the bet, but they can still win the initial purse prize money by winning the match.<ref name=":1" /> The merchant's shop is set up with six items on the first three pages, with the fourth page holding one of four random items that rotate out every match.<ref name=":2" /> The player and combatant are both allowed to carry up to four items in each match.<ref name=":1" /> There are a total of 24 different items in the game; all of which are consumed upon use.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.myabandonware.com/game/tongue-of-the-fatman-sh/play-sh|title=Tongue of the Fatman|website=My Abandonware|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

There are three status bars, with the blue bar representing the character's hit points, the green bar standing for the crowds favor, and the red bar displaying the effectiveness of techniques. The red bar is, the less damage your opponent takes from attacks, this bar declines after repeating the same offensive maneuver. This status bar is a clever balancing mechanic that makes spamming attacks less reliable and a less effective tactic. As for controls, the DOS platform to the PC version has been referred to as "clunky".<ref name=":0" /> Each character has 15 basic moves and 1 unique special ability that varies for each race. With each go around, the player has a maximum of 3 losses, every loss puts the player back two fights in the roster, and each of these defeats cost $100 for the good doctor to revive the player's mangled corpse.<ref name=":1" />
