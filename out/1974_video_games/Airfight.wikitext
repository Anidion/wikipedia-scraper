__NOTOC__
'''''Airfight''''' is an early [[3D graphics]]-based multi-user [[flight simulator]], created on the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC)  [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC) [[PLATO system]] in the early 1970s.<ref>{{Citation | title=Airfight | year=1974 | type=3-D flight simulator | first=Brand | last=Fortner}}</ref><ref name="ultimatehistoryvideogames">{{cite web | url=https://ultimatehistoryvideogames.jimdofree.com/airfight-plato | title=Airfight (PLATO) 1974 | work=Ultimate History of Video Games | accessdate=21 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/q7co9d/my_first_flight_sim_airfight_on_the_plato_system/ | title=My first flight sim?

The software was the first ever 3D flight simulator and the first [[multi-player]] flight simulator.<ref name="ultimatehistoryvideogames" /> The first version was developed by Brand Fortner with Kevin Gorey in the summer of 1974.<ref name="sweb">{{cite web | url=http://josef.havlik.sweb.cz/Bruce_Artwick.htm | title=Bruce Artwick and Stu Moment – The Flight Simulator Men | work=History of Microsoft Flight Simulator | accessdate=22 December 2021 | archive-date=21 September 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220921145310/http://josef.havlik.sweb.cz/Bruce_Artwick.htm | url-status=dead}}</ref> After its release, it became the most popular game on PLATO until ''[[Empire (1973 video game)|Empire]]'' became more popular. This software probably inspired the UIUC student [[Bruce Artwick]] to start the company [[Sublogic (company)|Sublogic]],<ref name="sweb" /> which was acquired and later became ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]''.<ref name="mfs">{{cite web | url=https://ultimatehistoryvideogames.jimdofree.com/microsoft-flight-simulator/ | title=Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0 (DOS) 1982 | work=Ultimate History of Video Games | accessdate=21 December 2021}}</ref>
