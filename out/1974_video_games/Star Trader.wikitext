'''''Star Trader''''' is a 1974 [[video game]] and an early example of the [[space flight simulation game#Space trading and combat game|space trading genre]]. The game involves players moving from star to star on a map of the galaxy, buying and selling quantities of six types of merchandise in a competition to make the most money. The game was developed by Dave Kaufman for computers in 1973, and its [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] source code was printed in the January 1974 issue of the ''[[People's Computer Company|People's Computer Company Newsletter]]''. It was reprinted in the 1977 book ''What to Do After You Hit Return''. The game was the inspiration for the multiplayer ''[[Trade Wars]]'' series, beginning in 1984, and is thought to be the antecedent to much of the space trading genre.

''Star Trader'' is a multiplayer [[space flight simulation game#Space trading and combat game|space trading]] game, in which players trade resources between star systems in order to make the most money. The game presents a star map of the [[galaxy]] in which each player moves about trading between star systems of different levels of economic development. The players travel from planet to planet buying and selling six types of merchandise: uranium, metals, gems, software, heavy equipment, and medicine. The different levels of planet have different needs and produce different kinds and amounts of goods, which influences their prices. In the course of the game the level of development of planets can improve and new planetary systems can be discovered. Haggling over the price of goods is a central part of gameplay. The game's interface is [[text mode|text-only]].

==Development==
''Star Trader'' was written by Dave Kaufman in the [[BASIC programming language]]. The [[source code]] to the game was published in the ''[[People's Computer Company|People's Computer Company Newsletter]]'' in volume 2, issue 3 in January 1974. The concept for the game is seemingly based on [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' series of novels.

==Legacy==
In 1977, the game's code was reprinted in ''What to Do After You Hit Return''.<ref>{{cite book |title=What to Do After You Hit Return |publisher=Hayden Book Company |date=1977 |isbn=0-8104-5476-9}}</ref> ''Star Trader'' was used as the inspiration for the first game of the ''[[Trade Wars]]'' series of multiplayer space trading games in 1984, making it the ancestor of many subsequent space trader games, including ''[[Eve Online]]'', the ''[[Wing Commander: Privateer|Wing Commander Privateer]]'' series, and ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' series.<ref name="pc_world">{{Cite web |last=Edwards |first=Benj |title=The Ten Greatest PC Games Ever |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |date=February 8, 2009 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/158850/the_ten_greatest_pc_games_ever.html?tk=nl_bex_h_reviews |accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref><ref name="SFVG">{{cite book |title=Science Fiction Video Games |last=Tringham |first=Neal Roger |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |date=2014-09-10 |page=212 |isbn=978-1-4822-0389-9}}</ref>
