{{nihongo foot|'''''Speed Race'''''|スピードレース|Supīdo Rēsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1974 [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[racing video game]] developed and manufactured by [[Taito]] and released under the titles '''''Racer''''' and '''''Wheels''''' in North America by distributor [[Midway Manufacturing]] in 1975. Designed by [[Tomohiro Nishikado]], the gameplay involves the player using the attached steering wheel to maneuver a car alongside a fast [[vertical scrolling]] road. The objective is to score points by driving past other cars without colliding with them; more points are awarded for driving faster. Players must do this under a 90-second time limit, which ends the game when it runs out. The gameplay concepts were adapted from two earlier driving [[electro-mechanical games]]: Kasco's ''Mini Drive'' (1958) and Taito's ''[[List of Taito games|Super Road 7]]'' (1970).

The original ''Speed Race'' and ''Wheels'' had an upright [[arcade cabinet]], while Midway's ''Racer'' introduced a sit-down cabinet.<ref name="Wolf">{{cite book |last1=Wolf |first1=Mark J.

The game was a worldwide commercial success. ''Speed Race'' was a hit in Japan, establishing {{nowrap|[[100 yen]]}} per play as the standard for arcade games there, while ''Wheels'' and ''Wheels II'' sold 10,000 [[arcade cabinet]]s in the United States to become the best-selling [[1975 in video games|arcade game of 1975]]. The ''Speed Race DX'' and ''Wheels'' versions were also among the top three highest-grossing [[1976 in video games|arcade games of 1976]] in Japan and the United States, respectively, while ''Speed Race DX'' was Japan's highest-grossing [[1977 in video games|arcade video game of 1977]]. The game spawned the ''Speed Race'' series of arcade racing games. The game's use of vertical scrolling was also influential on later games.

==Gameplay==
''Speed Race'' is a one or two-player [[racing video game]] where players controls a race car along a constantly-scrolling vertical road. The player uses a steering wheel to move the car left or right and an accelerator to make it move faster. The objective of the game is to drive past other cars that scroll past the players under a 90-second time limit without colliding into them. The time limit and the player's score are displayed on an auxiliary [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] display placed above the monitor. Points are earned by driving past cars, with additional points being awarded based on how fast the car is moving. Colliding with a car resets the player's speed and starts them at the beginning of the track. The game ends when the time limit runs out, though the timer can be extended by earning a certain number of points. Two difficulty modes are available that increase the speed of the cars and the number of cars on the track.<ref name="Manual"/>

==Development==
Following the release of [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]]'s ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' earlier in 1974, Taito employee [[Tomohiro Nishikado]] decided to develop his own racing video game the same year; he did not enjoy ''Gran Trak 10'', due to its twisting tracks and complex controls. Nishikado looked to two older driving [[electro-mechanical games]] for inspiration: Kasco's ''Mini Drive'' (1958) and Taito's 1970 rear-projection driving game ''Super Road 7'', the latter in turn similar to Kasco's ''Indy 500'' (1968) and [[Chicago Coin]]'s ''Speedway'' (1969). ''Mini Drive'' and ''Super Road 7'' involved driving a car down an endlessly scrolling road, with ''Super Road 7'' also having the need to dodge cars in front of the player. Nishikado adapted these gameplay concepts into a video game called ''Speed Race''. In order to simulate the scrolling effect and give the illusion of a moving background, he animated a background road image and modulated the speed of oncoming computer-controlled cars based on the player's speed.<ref name="Smith194">{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Alexander |title=They Create Worlds: The Story of the People and Companies That Shaped the Video Game Industry, Vol. I: 1971-1982 |date=19 November 2019 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-0-429-75261-2 |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cxy_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT194}}</ref>

==Reception==
In Japan, due to the complexity of the hardware, Taito released ''Speed Race'' at a price point of {{nowrap|[[100 yen]]}} per play, compared to the standard {{nowrap|50 [[Japanese yen|yen]]}} per play up until then. Despite this, the game became a major hit in Japan, establishing {{nowrap|100 yen}} as the standard price point for arcade games in Japan over the next several decades.<ref name="Smith194"/> The updated versions ''Speed Race DX'' and ''Speed Race Twin'' were among the top ten highest-grossing [[1976 in video games|arcade video games of 1976]] in Japan, with ''Speed Race DX'' at number two (below Taito's ''[[List of Taito games|Ball Park]]'') and ''Speed Race Twin'' at number eight.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=本紙アンケー 〜 ト調査の結果|trans-title=Paper Questionnaire: Results of the Survey |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=65|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 February 1977|pages=2–3|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19770201p.pdf#page=2}}</ref> ''Speed Race DX'' went on to be the highest-grossing [[1977 in video games|arcade video game of 1977]] in Japan, and second-highest-grossing overall [[arcade game]] below [[Namco]]'s electro-mechanical ''[[F-1 (arcade game)|F-1]]''.<ref name="GM90">{{cite magazine|title=結果ベスト3|trans-title=Best 3 Results |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=90|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 February 1978|pages=2–3|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19780215p.pdf#page=2}}</ref>

In North America, the game became a hit when it was released by Midway there in 1975.<ref name="Smith194"/> ''Wheels'' sold 7,000 [[arcade cabinet]]s and ''Wheels II'' sold 3,000 for a combined 10,000 sold in the United States, making it the best-selling [[1975 in video games|arcade game of 1975]], according to sales figures provided by [[Ralph H. Baer]].<ref name="Baer">{{cite book |last1=Baer |first1=Ralph H. |author1-link=Ralph H.

==Legacy==
The game's use of vertical scrolling was influential on later games. One of the games it influenced was [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]]'s ''[[Hi-way]]'' (1975), which added a sit-down cockpit cabinet like older electro-mechanical games.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Matt |title=Vintage Games 2.0: An Insider Look at the Most Influential Games of All Time |date=8 May 2019 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-000-00092-4 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fU-fDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA73}}</ref>
