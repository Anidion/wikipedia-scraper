'''''Pong''''' is a [[table tennis]]–themed [[Twitch gameplay|twitch]] arcade [[sports video game]], featuring simple [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional graphics]], manufactured by [[Atari, Inc|Atari]] and originally released on 29 November 1972. It was one of the earliest [[arcade video game]]s; it was created by [[Allan Alcorn]] as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder [[Nolan Bushnell]], but Bushnell and Atari co-founder [[Ted Dabney]] were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], the first [[home video game console]]. In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.

''Pong'' was the first commercially successful video game,<ref>{{cite web |title=Atari PONG |url=https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/4007/Atari-PONG |website=The Centre for Computing History |access-date=17 February 2024}}</ref> and it helped to establish the [[video game industry]] along with the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that closely mimicked its gameplay. Eventually, Atari's competitors released new types of video games that deviated from ''Pong''<nowiki/>'s original format to varying degrees, and this, in turn, led Atari to encourage its staff to move beyond ''Pong'' and produce more innovative games themselves.

Atari released several sequels to ''Pong'' that built upon the original's gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version of ''Pong'' exclusively through [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] retail stores. The home version was also a commercial success and led to numerous clones. The game was remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. ''Pong'' is part of the permanent collection of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C., due to its cultural impact.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Pong Game Test2.gif|thumb|left|alt=the video game is a representation of a game of table tennis.|The two paddles return the ball back and forth. The score is displayed at the top of the screen.]]
''Pong'' is a [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[sports game]] that simulates [[table tennis]]. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9074| title = Pong| publisher = [[Killer List of Videogames]]| access-date = 22 October 2008}}</ref><ref name="Fever">{{cite book| title = Arcade Fever: The Fan's Guide to The Golden Age of Video Games| first = John| last = Sellers| chapter = Pong | pages = 16–17| publisher = [[Running Press]]|date=August 2001| isbn = 0-7624-0937-1}}</ref><ref name="Ultimate-2">{{cite book| title = [[Ultimate History of Video Games]]| first = Steven| last = Kent|author-link=Steven L.

To acclimate Alcorn to creating games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly meant to be a warm-up exercise.<ref name="AlcornInterview"/><ref name="AmerHert">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20061129-pong-video-games-nolan-bushnell-atari-al-alcorn-nintendo.shtml |title=The Mother of All Video Games |magazine=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |first=David |last=Rapp |date=29 November 2006 |access-date=25 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517011435/http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20061129-pong-video-games-nolan-bushnell-atari-al-alcorn-nintendo.shtml |archive-date=17 May 2008 }}</ref> Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with [[General Electric]] for a product, and asked Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping.<ref name="AlcornInterview"/> In 2011, Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before; Bushnell played a version on a [[PDP-1]] computer in 1964 while attending college.<ref name="GI-215">{{cite magazine| magazine = Game Informer| title = The Father of the Game Industry Returns to Atari| first = Matt| last = Helgeson| issue = 215| page = 39|date=March 2011}}</ref> However, Alcorn has claimed it was in direct response to Bushnell's viewing of the [[Magnavox Odyssey]]'s Tennis game.<ref name="AlcornInterview"/> In May 1972, Bushnell had visited the [[Magnavox]] Profit Caravan in [[Burlingame, California]] where he played the Magnavox Odyssey demonstration, specifically the table tennis game.<ref name="RB-History">{{cite web| url = https://www.ralphbaer.com/video_game_history.htm| title = Video game history| publisher = R.

Alcorn first examined Bushnell's schematics for ''Computer Space'', but found them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball at a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed.<ref name="Ultimate-2"/> Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of the screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.<ref name="AlcornInterview"/>

Three months into development, Bushnell told Alcorn he wanted the game to feature realistic sound effects and a roaring crowd.<ref name="AlcornInterview"/><ref name="ArtOfGameWorlds">{{cite book| title = The Art of Game Worlds| first = Dave| last = Morris| page = 166| chapter = Funky Town| publisher = [[HarperCollins]]| isbn = 0-06-072430-7| year = 2004}}</ref> Dabney wanted the game to "boo" and "hiss" when a player lost a round. Alcorn had limited space available for the necessary electronics and was unaware of how to create such sounds with [[Digital electronics|digital circuits]]. After inspecting the [[Video signal generator#Sync pulse generators (SPG)|sync generator]], he discovered that it could generate different tones and used those for the game's sound effects.<ref name="Ultimate-2"/><ref name="AlcornInterview"/> To construct the prototype, Alcorn purchased a $75 [[Hitachi]] [[black-and-white]] television set from a local store, placed it into a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} wooden [[Arcade cabinet|cabinet]], and soldered the wires into boards to create the necessary circuitry. The prototype impressed Bushnell and Dabney so much that they felt it could be a profitable product and decided to test its marketability.<ref name="Ultimate-2"/>

After hearing about the game's success, Bushnell decided there would be more profit for Atari to manufacture the game rather than license it, but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued.<ref name="PriceGuide-1"/><ref name="Ultimate-4"/> Bushnell decided to inform each of the two groups that the other was uninterested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings.

After the success of ''Pong'', Bushnell pushed his employees to create new products.<ref name="PriceGuide-1"/><ref name="Ultimate-Home1">{{cite book| title = Ultimate History of Video Games| first = Steven| last = Kent| pages = 80–83| chapter = Could You Repeat That Two More Times?| publisher = Three Rivers Press| isbn = 0-7615-3643-4| year = 2001}}</ref> A new [[electronic technology]], the [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) chip, had recently become available, which Bushnell believed would "allow pioneering in new" game concepts. Atari began working on the reduction of ''Pong'' from a large arcade [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) down to a small LSI chip for use in a home system. The initial development cost for a game on a single LSI chip was expensive, costing around {{US$|50,000|1971|long=no|round=-3}}, but once the chip was developed, it became significantly cheaper to [[mass-produce]] the game as well as more difficult to [[reverse-engineer]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Albarardo |first=Sonny |title=Silicon Gulch cowboys aim to be top guns of games |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=October 1975 |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=31–7 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-1-number-10-october-1975-600dpi/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%201%2C%20Number%2010%20-%20October%201975/page/31}}</ref>

In 1974, Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of ''Pong'' that would connect to a television: ''Home Pong''. The system began development under the codename ''Darlene'', named after an  employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype and based them on the same digital technology used in their arcade games. The two worked in shifts to save time and money; Lee worked on the design's logic during the day, while Alcorn [[Debugging|debugged]] the designs in the evenings. After the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype. The prototype consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal containing over a hundred wires, which would eventually be replaced with a [[integrated circuit|single chip]] designed by Alcorn and Lee; the chip had yet to be tested and built before the prototype was constructed. The chip was finished in the latter half of 1974, and was, at the time, the highest-performing chip used in a [[consumer product]].<ref name="Ultimate-Home1"/>

Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's vice-president of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell ''Home Pong'', but were rejected. Retailers felt the product was too expensive and would not interest consumers.<ref name="Three Rivers Press">{{cite book|last1=Kent|first1=Steven L/|title=the Ultimate History of Video Games|date=2001|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=0-7615-3643-4}}</ref> Bushnell contacted [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] after coming across a [[Magnavox Odyssey]] advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff (including Bushnell and Lipkin) discussed the game with a representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a ''Home Pong'' booth at the American Toy Fair (a [[trade fair]]) in [[New York City]], but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders due to high price of the unit.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Alexander |title=They Create Worlds: The Story of the People and Companies That Shaped the Video Game Industry, Vol. I: 1971–1982 |date=2019 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9780429752612 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cxy_DwAAQBAJ&q=Atari+home+pong+toy+trade+fair+1975&pg=PT207 |access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref>

While at the show, they met Quinn again, and, a few days later, set up a meeting with him to obtain a sales order. In order to gain approval from the Sporting Goods department, Quinn suggested Atari demonstrate the game to executives in Chicago. Alcorn and Lipkin traveled to the [[Sears Tower]] and, despite a technical complication in connection with an antenna on top of the building which broadcast on the same channel as the game, obtained approval. Bushnell told Quinn he could produce 75,000&nbsp;units in time for the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas season]]; however, Quinn requested double the amount. Though Bushnell knew Atari lacked the capacity to manufacture 150,000&nbsp;units, he agreed.<ref name="Ultimate-Home1"/> Atari acquired a new factory through funding obtained by [[venture capital]]ist [[Don Valentine]].

In April 1974 Magnavox filed suit against Atari, Allied Leisure, [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]] and [[Chicago Coin|Chicago Dynamics]].<ref name="Magnavox Sues">{{cite news| title = Magnavox Sues Firms Making Video Games, Charges Infringement| newspaper = The Wall Street Journal| date = 17 April 1974}}</ref> Magnavox argued that Atari had infringed on Sanders Associates' patents relating to the concept of electronic ping-pong based on detailed records Ralph Baer kept of the Odyssey's design process dating back to 1966. Other documents included depositions from witnesses and a signed guest book that demonstrated Bushnell had played the Odyssey's table tennis game prior to releasing ''Pong''.<ref name="RB-How">{{cite web| url = https://www.ralphbaer.com/how_video_games.htm| title = Genesis: How the Home Video Games Industry Began| first = Ralph| last = Baer| publisher = R.

After considering his options, Bushnell decided to settle with Magnavox out of court in June 1976. Bushnell's lawyer felt they could win; however, he estimated legal costs of US$1.5&nbsp;million, which would have exceeded Atari's funds. Magnavox offered Atari an agreement to become a licensee for US$1.5 million payable in eight installments. In addition, Magnavox obtained the right to full information on Atari products publicly announced or released over the next year.<ref name="RB-How"/><ref name="Ultimate-Legal"/> Magnavox continued to pursue legal action against the other companies, and proceedings began shortly after Atari's settlement. The first case took place at the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois|district court]] in Chicago, with Judge John Grady presiding.

[[File:Турнир-Game-Console.jpg|thumb|left|Dedicated ''Pong'' consoles made their way to various countries, like the Soviet [[Turnir (console)|Turnir]].]]

The ''Pong'' arcade games manufactured by Atari were a great success. The prototype was well received by Andy Capp's Tavern patrons; people came to the bar solely to play the game.<ref name="PriceGuide-1"/><ref name="Ultimate-4"/> Following its release, ''Pong'' consistently earned four times more revenue than other coin-operated machines.<ref name="Ultimate-8">{{cite book| title = Ultimate History of Video Games| first = Steven| last = Kent| pages = 53–54| chapter = The King and Court| publisher = Three Rivers Press| isbn = 0-7615-3643-4| year = 2001}}</ref> Bushnell estimated that the game earned US$35–40 per day (i.e.{{nbsp}}140–160 plays daily per console at $0.25 per play), which he described as nothing he'd ever seen before in the coin-operated entertainment industry at the time.<ref name="GI-215"/> The game's earning power resulted in an increase in the number of orders Atari received. This provided Atari with a steady source of income; the company sold the machines at three times the [[Cost-of-production theory of value|cost of production]]. By 1973, the company had filled 2,500&nbsp;orders, and at the end of 1974, sold more than 8,000&nbsp;units.<ref name="Ultimate-8"/> The arcade cabinets have since become collector's items with the [[Arcade cabinet#Cocktail or table cabinets|cocktail-table version]] being the rarest.<ref name="PriceGuide-5">{{cite book| title = Official Price Guide to Classic Video Games| first = David| last = Ellis| page = [https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/400 400]| chapter = Arcade Classics| publisher = Random House| isbn = 0-375-72038-3| year = 2004| chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/400}}</ref> Soon after the game's successful testing at Andy Capp's Tavern, other companies began visiting the bar to inspect it. Similar games appeared on the market three months later, produced by companies like Ramtek and [[Nutting Associates]].<ref name="Ultimate-9">{{cite book| title = Ultimate History of Video Games| first = Steven| last = Kent| pages = 60–61| chapter = The Jackals| publisher = Three Rivers Press| isbn = 0-7615-3643-4| year = 2001}}</ref> Atari could do little against the competitors as they had not initially filed for patents on the [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] technology used in the game. When the company did file for patents, complications delayed the process. As a result, the market consisted primarily of "''Pong'' clones"; author Steven Kent estimated that Atari had produced less than a third of the machines.<ref name="Ultimate-10">{{cite book| title = Ultimate History of Video Games| first = Steven| last = Kent| page = 58| chapter = The King and Court| publisher = Three Rivers Press| isbn = 0-7615-3643-4| year = 2001}}</ref> Bushnell referred to the competitors as "Jackals" because he felt they had an unfair advantage. His solution to competing against them was to produce more innovative games and concepts.<ref name="Ultimate-9"/><ref name="Ultimate-10"/>

''Home Pong'' was an instant success following its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000&nbsp;units were sold that holiday season.<ref name="PriceGuide-2">{{cite book| title = Official Price Guide to Classic Video Games| first = David| last = Ellis| pages = [https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/33 33–36]| chapter = Dedicated Consoles| publisher = Random House| isbn = 0-375-72038-3| year = 2004| chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/33}}</ref><ref name="Ultimate-Home3">{{cite book| title = Ultimate History of Video Games| first = Steven| last = Kent| pages = 94–95| chapter = Strange Bedfellows| publisher = Three Rivers Press| isbn = 0-7615-3643-4| year = 2001}}</ref> The game became Sears' most successful product at the time, which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award.<ref name="Ultimate-Home3"/> Atari's own version sold an additional 50,000 units.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.wired.com/2012/06/atari-40th-anniversary/ | title = Timeline: A Look Back at 40 Years of Atari | first = John | last = Booth | date = 27 June 2012 | access-date = 14 August 2020 | magazine = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones to capitalize on the home console's success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features and, later, released updated versions. [[Coleco]] entered the video game market with their [[Telstar (game console)|Telstar console]]; it features three ''Pong'' variants and was also succeeded by newer models.<ref name="PriceGuide-2"/> Nintendo released the [[Color TV-Game|Color TV-Game 6]] in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV-Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo's entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves—they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey.<ref name="GameOver-LightTennis"/> The dedicated ''Pong'' consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Atari's ''Pong'' consoles are common, while APF Electronics' [[APF TV Fun|TV Fun]] consoles are moderately rare.<ref name="PriceGuide-3">{{cite book| title = Official Price Guide to Classic Video Games| first = David| last = Ellis| pages = [https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/37 37–41]| chapter = Dedicated Consoles| publisher = Random House| isbn = 0-375-72038-3| year = 2004| chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/37}}</ref> Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; the Sears Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.<ref name="PriceGuide-2"/>

Bushnell felt that ''Pong'' was especially significant in its role as a [[social lubricant]], since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play ''Pong'' and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, there are a lot of people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing ''Pong'',' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=What the Hell has Nolan Bushnell Started? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=4|date=April 1995|page=11}}</ref>

===Ports===
Atari remade the game on numerous platforms. In 1977, ''Pong'' and several variants of the game were featured in ''[[Video Olympics]]'', one of the original release titles for the [[Atari 2600]].

''Pong'' has also been included in several Atari compilations on many different platforms, such as ''[[Arcade Classics]]'' on the [[Sega Genesis]], Paired with ''[[Asteroids]]'' and ''[[Yars Revenge]]'' on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. ''Atari Classics Evolved'' on the [[PlayStation Portable]], ''[[Retro Atari Classics]]'' on the [[Nintendo DS]], and ''[[Atari Anthology|Atari: 80 Classic Games in One!]]'' for [[personal computer]], and the ''[[Atari 50|Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration]]'' (2022) compilation for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Steam (service)|Steam]], and [[Xbox One]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ign.com/games/arcade-classics/gen-591| title = Arcade Classics| website = [[IGN]]| access-date = 25 December 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150713094513/http://www.ign.com/games/arcade-classics/gen-591| archive-date = 13 July 2015| url-status = live| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/atariclassicsevolved/news.html?sid=6184181| title = Retro Arcade Masterpieces Hit Store Shelves in Atari Classics Evolved| author = Atari| website = [[GameSpot]]| date = 20 December 2007| access-date = 25 December 2008| author-link = Atari| archive-url= https://archive.today/20120913102038/http://www.gamespot.com/news/retro-arcade-masterpieces-hit-store-shelves-in-atari-classics-evolved-6184181| archive-date= 13 September 2012| url-status= dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/retro-atari-classics-review/1900-6120954/| title = Retro Atari Classics Review| first = Jeff| last = Gerstmann| author-link = Jeff Gerstmann| website = GameSpot| date = 23 March 2005| access-date = 25 December 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180316024040/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/retro-atari-classics-review/1900-6120954/| archive-date = 16 March 2018| url-status = live| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/atari80games/news.html?sid=6094407| title = Atari: 80 Classic Games in One Company Line| website = GameSpot| date = 23 April 2004| access-date = 25 December 2008 | archive-url= https://archive.today/20120905164829/http://www.gamespot.com/news/atari-80-classic-games-in-one-company-line-6094407|archive-date=5 September 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-opens-up-massive-classic-game-library/1100-6106808/| title = Atari opens up massive classic-game library| first = Chris| last = Kohler| website = GameSpot| date = 7 September 2004| access-date = 25 December 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180125120143/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-opens-up-massive-classic-game-library/1100-6106808/| archive-date = 25 January 2018| url-status = live| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Machkovech|first=Sam|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/the-103-classic-games-that-did-and-didnt-make-the-atari-50-anniversary-cut/|title=The 103 Classic Games That Did, and Didn't, Make the Atari 50 Anniversary Cut — Retailer Leak Suggests Games from Arcade to Jaguar; Surprises Apparently Still Await|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=September 12, 2022|access-date=May 23, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220914101824/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/the-103-classic-games-that-did-and-didnt-make-the-atari-50-anniversary-cut/|archive-date=September 14, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Sequels and remakes===
[[File:Atari Super Pong IV (1976) 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a dedicated video game console.|Tele-Games ''Pong IV'', [[Sears]]' version of ''Pong'' sequel (''Pong Doubles''), was one of the many consoles that flooded the market by 1977.]]
Bushnell felt the best way to compete against imitators was to create better products, leading Atari to produce sequels in the years following the original's release: ''Pong Doubles'', ''Super Pong'', ''Quadrapong'' and ''Pinpong''.<ref name="Fever"/> The sequels feature similar graphics, but include new gameplay elements; for example, ''Pong Doubles'' allows four players to compete in pairs, while ''Quadrapong''—also released by [[Kee Games]] as ''Elimination''—has them compete against each other in a four-way field.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9075| title = Pong Doubles| publisher = Killer List of Videogames| access-date = 31 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9187| title = Quadrapong| publisher = Killer List of Videogames| access-date = 31 December 2008}}</ref> Bushnell also conceptualized a [[free-to-play]] version of ''Pong'' to entertain children in a Doctor's office. He initially titled it ''Snoopy Pong'' and fashioned the cabinet after [[Snoopy]]'s doghouse with the character on top, but retitled it to ''[[Doctor Pong|Puppy Pong]]'' and altered Snoopy to a generic dog to avoid legal action.

A [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[platform game]] with [[puzzle]] and [[Shooter game|shooter]] elements was reportedly in development by [[Atari Corporation]] for the [[Atari Jaguar]] in September 1995 under the title ''Pong 2000'', as part of their series of arcade game updates for the system and was set to have an original storyline for it,<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Quartermann|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:EGM_US_070.pdf&page=54|title=Gaming Gossip|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=70|date=May 1995|page=54}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Gore|first=Chris|url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_The_Ultimate_Gaming_Magazine_Issue_80_September_1995#page/n21/mode/1up|title=The Gorescore – Industry News You Can – The Return of Pong|magazine=[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment#VideoGames - The Ultimate Gaming Magazine|VideoGames – The Ultimate Gaming Magazine]]|issue=80|date=September 1995|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Schmudde|url=https://atariage.com/forums/topic/231545-lost-interview-with-francois-yves-bertrand/|title=Lost interview with Francois Yves Bertrand|website=[[AtariAge]]|date=5 November 2014|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> but it was never released.

In 1999, [[Hasbro Interactive]] released a new title known as ''[[Pong: The Next Level]]'' for home computers and the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].
