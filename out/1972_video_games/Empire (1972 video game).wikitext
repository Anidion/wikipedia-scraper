'''''Empire''''' is a [[4X]] [[computer wargame]] created in 1972 by [[Peter Langston]], taking its name from a [[Reed College]] board game of the same name. It was initially created by Langston in BASIC on an [[HP2000]] [[minicomputer]] at [[Evergreen State College]]. When the host computer was retired, the [[source code]] to the game was lost. Subsequently, two other authors each independently wrote a new version of the game, both named ''Empire''. In the decades since, numerous other versions of ''Empire'' have been developed for a wide variety of platforms.

The game is [[turn-based]], with players giving orders at their convenience, and in some versions then executed simultaneously by the game server at set intervals ranging from a few hours to once per day. The [[Virtual world|game world]] consists of "sectors", which may be designated as agricultural, industrial, etc. There are dozens of unit types requiring a variety of raw and manufactured materials for their creation. "Blitz" games may last a few hours, typical games a few months, and some larger games up to a year.

==Gameplay==
''Empire'' is a [[turn-based]] [[4X]] [[Wargame (video games)|wargame]], where players command armies of units which they use to explore the game world, control territory, and attack opponents. The [[Virtual world|game world]] consists of "sectors", which may be designated as agricultural, industrial, etc. Control of these sectors grants the player a variety of raw and manufactured materials, which they may use to construct dozens of unit types. In each round, the players submit their commands for the activities of their units to the central server, which executes all of the commands either simultaneously or in a sequence. Rounds can last anywhere from a few hours to a day. As such, a full game can take much longer than modern 4X games, depending on the size of the game world; "Blitz" games may last a few hours, while typical games last months and larger games can take up to a year to complete.

Numerous other versions were created over the next decade for various computer types, including ''KSU Empire'', ''Xerox Development Environment (XDE) Empire'' on [[Xerox]] [[computer workstation]]s, ''PC Empire'' by Gordon Storga for [[DOS]], ''Amiga Empire'' for the [[Amiga]], and ''Wolfpack Empire''.<ref name="WPE"/><ref name="GS"/> In 1984, Ben Norton wrote a version titled ''Empire Classic'' in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] on an [[HP3000]] and released to the HP3000 Contributed Library, which became the definitive version until the ''Wolfpack Empire'' project began in 1996.<ref name="WPE"/><ref name="Floogle">{{cite web|url=http://empire.floogle.net/|title=Index of /|website=Empire.floogle.net|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref> In 2003, the game was ported to the [[C++]] programming language for the [[Linux]] operating system, and a subsequent Java client/server version was produced.<ref name="Floogle"/>
