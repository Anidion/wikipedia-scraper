{{nihongo foot|'''''Radar Scope'''''|レーダースコープ|Rēdā Sukōpu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1980 [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade game]] developed by [[Nintendo Research & Development 2|Nintendo R&D2]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. The player assumes the role of the Sonic Spaceport starship and must wipe out formations of an enemy race known as the Gamma Raiders before they destroy the player's space station. Gameplay is similar to ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Galaxian]]'', but viewed from a three-dimensional third-person perspective.

''Radar Scope'' was a commercial failure and created a financial crisis for the subsidiary [[Nintendo of America]]. Its president, [[Minoru Arakawa]], pleaded for his father-in-law, Nintendo president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]], to send him a new game that could convert and salvage thousands of unsold ''Radar Scope'' machines. This prompted the creation of ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''. ''Radar Scope'' is one of the first video game projects for artist [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and for composer [[Hirokazu Tanaka]].

Retrospectively, critics have praised ''Radar Scope'' for its gameplay and design being a unique iteration upon the ''Space Invaders'' template. One critic labeled it one of Nintendo's most important games because its commercial failure inadvertently led to the creation of [[Mario|Nintendo's mascot character]] and helped pave the way for the company's entry into the console video game market.

In the late 1970s, [[Nintendo Co., Ltd.]] began shifting its focus away from toys and playing cards into the arcade market. This followed the [[1973 oil crisis]] having increased the cost of manufacturing toys, and the widespread success of [[Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1978.<ref name="USGamer"/> Nintendo had briefly experimented with [[Arcade game#Electro-mechanical games|electro-mechanical arcade]] gun games such as ''[[Wild Gunman]]'' and the ''[[Laser Clay Shooting System]]'', followed by [[arcade video game]]s such as ''EVR-Race'', ''[[Sheriff (video game)|Sheriff]]'', ''[[Space Fever]]'', and the [[Color TV-Game]] line of dedicated home consoles.<ref name="Ultimate History">{{cite book|last=Kent |first=Steven L. |author-link=Steven L.

''Radar Scope'' was created by Nintendo Research & Development 2 (R&D2). Masayuki Uemura led the development of the game, while [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] programmed the audio and composed the music. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] assisted in the game's art production as one of his first video game projects; however, his role in development is often debated, with some claiming he designed the onscreen graphics, and others saying he simply created the arcade cabinet artwork.<ref name="USGamer"/> David Scheff's book ''[[Game Over (Sheff book)|Game Over]]'' claims that Miyamoto found the game "simplistic and banal" after it was completed.<ref name="USGamer"/><ref name="Game Over">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/0966961706 |title=Game Over: How Nintendo conquered the world|last=Sheff|first=David|date=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=9780307800749|edition=1st Vintage books|location=New York|oclc=780180879 | access-date=27 July 2019}}</ref>

The arcade hardware for ''Radar Scope'' was co-developed with [[Ikegami Tsushinki]]. It is based on [[Namco]]'s ''[[Galaxian]]'' (1979), with technology such as high-speed [[emitter-coupled logic]] (ECL) [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chips and [[Computer memory|memory]] on a 50 MHz [[printed circuit board]]. ''Galaxian'', in turn, was based on ''Space Invaders'' hardware, replacing the more intensive [[bitmap]] rendering system with a hardware [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] rendering system that animates sprites over a [[scrolling]] background, allowing more detailed graphics, faster gameplay, and a scrolling animated starfield background.<ref name="Nikkei6">{{cite magazine |title=【任天堂「ファミコン」はこうして生まれた】 第6回：業務用ゲーム機の挫折をバネにファミコンの実現に挑む |trans-title=How the Famicom Was Born – Part 6: Making the Famicom a Reality |magazine=Nikkei Electronics |date=September 12, 1994 |publisher=[[Nikkei Business Publications]] |lang=ja |url=http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/special/20081001/1019315/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006082447/http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/special/20081001/1019315/ |archive-date=October 6, 2008 |access-date=13 April 2021}}

In a 1998 retrospective review, Earl Green of ''[[Allgame]]'' said the 3D perspective is a unique idea for the time, and that ''Radar Scope'' improved the trend of countless games styled after the archetypal ''[[Space Invaders]]''.<ref name="Allgame"/> ''Shack News'' writer Greg Burke liked the game's colorful visuals and interesting gameplay which differentiate it from games like ''Galaxian'' and ''Space Invaders''.<ref name="Shack News">{{cite web |last1=Burke |first1=Greg |title=Shack's Arcade Corner: Radar Scope |url=https://www.shacknews.com/article/100419/shacks-arcade-corner-radar-scope |website=Shack News |access-date=9 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623061223/http://www.shacknews.com/article/100419/shacks-arcade-corner-radar-scope |archive-date=23 June 2017 |date=22 June 2017}}</ref> ''[[1UP.com]]'' criticized the lack of "tight design" as found in ''Galaxian'', and for its blaring and annoying sound effects.

In 2014, Jeremy Parish of ''[[USGamer]]'' said that ''Radar Scope'' "belonged to the better class of [''Space Invaders''] rip-offs".<ref name="USGamer"/> He greatly applauded the 3D perspective for providing a unique sense of progression and depth.<ref name="USGamer"/> He was disappointed that the game is poorly recognized over the decades due to its rough history and scarcity, writing: "Sadly, ''Radar Scope'' tends to be brushed under the rug as a matter of no real significance: A failed game whose only positive contribution to gaming history was providing an opportunity for something better to come along. In truth, though, ''Radar Scope'' wasn't a poor game by any measure; its crimes were instead a simple matter of timing, and of being the focus of Nintendo's ill-conceived ambitions."<ref name="USGamer"/> He said that ''Radar Scope'' created a "lever" that allowed Nintendo to successfully propel themselves into the console market.<ref name="USGamer">{{cite web |last1=Parish |first1=Jeremy |title=35 Years Ago, Nintendo's First Brush With Video Disaster |url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/35-years-ago-nintendo-had-its-first-brush-with-video-game-disaster |website=[[USGamer]] |access-date=9 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502051532/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/35-years-ago-nintendo-had-its-first-brush-with-video-game-disaster |archive-date=2 May 2019 |date=21 January 2014}}</ref>
