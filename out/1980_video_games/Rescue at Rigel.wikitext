'''''Rescue at Rigel''''' is a 1980 [[science fiction]] [[role-playing video game]] written and published by Automated Simulations (later known as [[Epyx]]). It is based on a modified version of their ''[[Temple of Apshai]]'' [[game engine]], which was used for most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the [[Apple II]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] (as a [[self-booting disk]]), [[TRS-80]], [[Commodore PET|PET]], [[VIC-20]], and [[Atari 8-bit computers]].

The game requires the player to search out a space fortress looking for ten hostages. Presented in a top-down view, the player can only see the area immediately around them, so the entire base has to be searched room by room. There is a 60-minute time limit on the mission.

''Rescue at Rigel'' was followed by ''[[Star Warrior]]'', and the two rebranded to be part of their "Starquest" series.

Players take on the role of adventurer Sudden Smith. Smith must try to rescue captives from the interior of an [[asteroid]] orbiting the [[star]] [[Rigel]]. Players have 60 minutes to rescue 10 human captives from the alien moon base. They must first find the captives before delivering them to the rescue ship (via a transport beam).

Players must defeat or avoid the enemies wandering the base: the alien Tollahs, two types of armed [[robot]]s, a six-legged "cerbanth", venomous flying "thornets", and a huge [[amoeba|amoebic]] [[slug]]. As players forge deeper into the alien stronghold, they have the opportunity to acquire better weapons.

The playfield is presented as a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down view]] of the current location of the hero. The game is turn-based, with the player given a certain number of "points" to spend on various actions, completing their turn when the points ran out. ''Rescue at Rigel'' is very similar to ''[[Temple of Apshai]]'', a popular [[dungeon crawl]] by Epyx, part of their "Dunjonquest" series. ''Rescue at Rigel'' had a timer similar to ''[[The Datestones of Ryn]]'', an earlier Dunjonquest game.

''Rescue at Rigel'' used the concept of providing room descriptions similar to those used in some ''[[Dunjonquest]]'' games, but instead of unique descriptions for numbered rooms, the game had multiple rooms labeled "Sanctum", for example, and a detailed description of what typical Sanctums contained was provided in the manual along with about a dozen other room types.
