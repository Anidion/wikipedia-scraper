'''''Phoenix''''' is a [[fixed shooter]] video game developed for arcades in Japan and released in 1980 by [[Taito]]. The player controls a space ship shooting at incoming enemies that fly from the top of the screen down towards the player's ship. There are five stages which repeat endlessly. The fifth is a fight against a large enemy spaceship, making ''Phoenix'' one of the first shooters with a [[Boss (video games)|boss battle]], an element that would become common for the genre.

The game was created in Japan by an unknown developer. Following the game's release in Europe and Japanese arcades in 1980, ''Phoenix'' was distributed in the United States by [[Centuri]], where it helped the company turn a profit after a loss the previous year. [[Atari, Inc.]] contracted the rights to develop a home port for the [[Atari 2600]] and sued [[Imagic]] for their game ''[[Demon Attack]]'', which they felt was too similar to ''Phoenix''. The 2600 version was released in 1983.

''Phoenix'' received positive reviews from video game publications such as ''[[Electronic Games]]'', ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers and Games]]'', and ''[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Phoenix'' is a [[Shoot 'em up|fixed-screen shooter]], set in space.{{sfn|Montfort|Bogost|2009|p=96}}{{sfn|Weiss}} The player maneuvers left and right to avoid objects such as missiles and charging enemies. A force field can be used by the player to protect them from these attacks. The force field only lasts a few seconds and then cannot be used for approximately five seconds after.{{sfn|Centuri|1982|p=3|ref=PhoenixSM}}

There are five stages. The first begins with a wave of 16 small phoenixes that drop missiles to attack the players spaceship. A second wave includes more birds. The third wave introduces an enemy that appears in a group of eight. These enemies start as eggs than grow into blue phoenix birds that attack the ship. They need to be destroyed by being hit in the center, otherwise a shot will only destroy the bird's wing that can regenerate itself in a short time. The fourth stage features pink phoenix enemies, which can be destroyed similarly to the previous round. The fifth stage features a space fortress with a pack of small birds that attack the spaceship. The space fortress shoots missiles and approaches the player. After the space creature who pilots the ship is hit, the round is complete.{{sfn|Centuri|1982|p=3|ref=PhoenixSM}}

Switches are available on the arcade machine to the operator of the machine that can adjust gameplay. These switches allow the number of initial lives in the game to range between three and six, while other switches control what score is required to earn an extra life.{{sfn|Centuri|1982|p=8|ref=PhoenixSM}}

==Development==
[[File:Phoenix-1980-italy.jpg|thumb|left|An Italian arcade cabinet of ''Phoenix''. The game was distributed in Japan and Europe before its release to American arcades.]]
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, several game companies made outer-space themed shooter games, which involved players destroying alien space fleets. These games generally shared the traits of enemies slowing approaching towards the player from the top of the screen and attacking the player. ''Phoenix'' was one of the games following this trend.{{sfn|Horowitz|2018|p=31}}

''Phoenix'' was initially developed in Japan.{{sfn|Davis|1982}} The original developer of ''Phoenix'' is unknown.{{sfn|Retro Gamer|2017|p=34|ref=RG172}} The rights to the game for distribution were owned by several companies, including Amstar Electronics who were based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].{{sfn|Horowitz|2020|p=43}}{{sfn|Cashbox|1981|p=42|ref=CashBox3}} [[Centuri]] entered into a licensing agreement with Amstar Electronics to release ''Phoenix'' in the United States, Canada, and Central and South America.{{sfn|Cashbox|1981|p=42|ref=CashBox3}} Centuri had previously been Allied Leisure Industries, with Ed Miller becoming the company's president in 1980. Prior to working at Centuri, Miller had worked for [[Taito]], where he had arranged a deal with to license ''[[Space Invaders]]'' to [[Bally Manufacturing]].{{sfn|The Jackson Sun|ref=The Jackson Sun}} 

In 1982, Atari received a four-year contract to distribute all current and future Centuri arcade games outside of the arcade systems, and the first three games announced were ports of the games ''[[Vanguard (video game)|Vanguard]]'', ''Challenger'' and ''Phoenix''.{{sfn|Corderi|1982}} The Atari port of the game was made by John Mraceck and Michael Feinstein. Mraceck was a junior at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] at the time and made the game as part of his internship.{{sfn|Hickey, Jr.|2021|p=52}} It was developed in mid-1982.{{sfn|Hickey, Jr.|2021|p=54}} Mraceck said that they had to cut over one-third of their original code to fit the game on the cart.{{sfn|Hickey, Jr.|2021|p=55}} The two developers were limited to 8 KB rom cartridge for the game.{{sfn|Hickey, Jr.|2021|p=54}} The Atari 2600 version is missing elements from the arcade original, such as the ability to save high scores, the music, the star field background, numerals representing points when a bird is hit, the smaller birds appearing around the mothership, and has fewer enemies appear on the screen.{{sfn|Weiss|2014|p=164}}{{sfn|Weiss|2011|p=89}} The music lost from the arcade version included "[[Romance (guitar piece)|Romance de Amor]]", which is played when the game starts and "[[FÃ¼r Elise]]" which is played when a player completes a level.{{sfn|Weiss|2014|p=164}}{{sfn|Lerner|2014|p=333}}

==Release==
''Phoenix'' was released in Japan on December 1980 where it was licensed to [[Taito]].{{sfn|Akagi|2006|p=42}} The arcade version of the game was distributed in the United States by Centuri in January 1981.{{sfn|Horowitz|2020|p=43}}{{sfn|Cashbox|1981|p=37|ref=CashBox1}}

''Phoenix'' was released for the Atari 2600 in February 1983.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]|volume=1|issue=12|date=March 1983|title=Availability Update}}</ref> Atari had the exclusive rights to produce ''Phoenix'' for home consoles and filed suit against the company [[Imagic]], believing that their game ''[[Demon Attack]]'' (1982) was too derivative of ''Phoenix''. A settlement was reached in January 1983, with Imagic still being allowed to release ''Demon Attack'' for the Atari 2600.{{sfn|Crookes|2016|p=54}} ''Phoenix'' was released for home computers and game systems in the compilation game ''[[Taito Legends]]'' (2005) for [[Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], and Windows PCs.{{sfn|Fox|2013|p=214}}{{sfn|Dahlen|2010|p=40}}

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:ARC Phoenix.png|thumb|right|''Phoenix'' is one of the first shooter games to feature a boss battle.]]

The arcade game was popular in Europe and Japan.{{sfn|Cashbox|1981|p=46|ref=CashBox3}} At the end of 1981, Centuri reported revenues of [[United States dollar|USD$]]61.4 million with a profit of 7.5 million. In comparison, the company's previous year gross was $5.9 million with a loss of $4.5 million.{{sfn|Corderi|1982}} ''Phoenix'' was the best selling of Centuri's titles by 1982.{{sfn|The Jackson Sun|ref=The Jackson Sun}} The Atari 2600 version sold over 600,000 units.{{sfn|Hickey, Jr.|2021|p=52}}

''[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]'' referred to the Atari 2600 adaptation as a good translation of the arcade classic.<ref>
{{cite magazine|magazine=The Video Game Update|volume=1|issue=10|date=January 1983|title=Critically Speak... Atari 2600-Compatible}}</ref> In ''[[Electronic Games]]'', [[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]] and Arnie Katz wrote that the game was favorably compared to other Atari 2600 releases such as ''Vanguard'', ''[[Yars' Revenge]]'', and ''[[Demons to Diamonds]]'', noting the quality in graphics and control, and stating it "is perhaps the finest invasion title ever produced for the 2600!"{{sfn|Katz|Kunkel|1983|p=42}} 
Noel Steere of ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers and Games]]'' praised the game, stating it was a "perfect arcade adaptation" with beautiful sound, which made up "for the sin of ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600 video game)|Pac-Man]]''".{{sfn|Steere|1983|p=59}} The game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of "1984 Best Science Fiction / Fantasy Videogame" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]].{{sfn|Kunkel|Katz|1984|p=42}}

In a retrospective review by Brett Alan Weiss of [[RhythmOne#AllGame|AllGame]] the game was awarded a five out of five rating, referring to it as a "one of the most impressive games the "slide-and-shoot" genre has to offer, bested only by ''[[Galaga]]'' in terms of sheer enjoyment and replayability" and said that "finely balanced" shooting action combined with "colorfully" animated graphics made ''Phoenix'' a classic in shooter genre.{{sfn|Weiss}} In his book ''The Video Game Guide'' (2013), Matt Fox gave the game a four star rating out of five, comparing it to ''[[Galaxian]]'' (1979), stating that ''Phoenix'' took its gameplay "a few screens further".{{sfn|Fox|2013|p=214}} In 1995, ''[[Flux (magazine)|Flux]]'' magazine ranked the arcade version of ''Phoenix'' at #69 on their list of "Top 100 Video Games", saying that it was one of the better ''Space Invaders'' variations.{{sfn|Amrich|Barbagallo|East|Hudak|1995|p=31}} Discussing the game in ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', Nick Thorpe compared the game to ''Space Invaders'', finding ''Phoenix'' "considerably advanced" due to its difficulty to predict behaviors of enemies and final boss fight while also noting that it lacked some elements from modern shooters, such as power-ups and a larger enemy variety.{{sfn|Thorpe|2022|p=18}} The publication included the Atari 2600 port of the game in their list of the top 25 games for the system.{{sfn|Jones|Hunt|2008|pp=24-25}}

''Phoenix'' was one of the first shooter games to have a boss battle.{{sfn|Horowitz|2020|p=43}} Bosses would come to typify the shooter genre following the release of the game.{{sfn|Montfort|Bogost|2009|p=130}} Games that borrowed elements from ''Phoenix'' include ''Space Vultures'', ''[[Gorf]]'' (1981), ''[[Pleiades (arcade game)|Pleiades]]'' (1981), and ''Condor Attack'' (1983).{{sfn|Weiss|2011|p=16}}{{sfn|Weiss|2011|p=47}}{{sfn|Burton}} Bootleg versions of ''Phoenix'' were released in arcades as ''Condor'', ''Griffon'', ''Vautour'', and ''Batman Part 2''.{{sfn|Retro Game|2006|p=77|ref=RetroGame}}
