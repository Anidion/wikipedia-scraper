==Reception==
Forrest Johnson reviewed ''Winged Samurai'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 33.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Johnson |first=Forrest |date=November 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=33|pages=36â€“37}}</ref> Johnson commented that "Unfortunately, in creating this historical authenticity, the programmer sacrificed the ''game'' to the ''simulation''. The display is purely two-dimensional, and the graphics are unimpressive.&nbsp;... The game is not real time. You can take all day to make your combat decisions.&nbsp;... Recommended to historical aviation gamers."<ref name="SG"/>
