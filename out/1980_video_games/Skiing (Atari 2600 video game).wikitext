==Gameplay==
[[File:Skiing-2600.png|thumb|right|Gameplay]]
''Skiing'' is a [[Single-player video game|single player]] only game, in which the player uses the [[joystick]] to control the direction and speed of a stationary [[Skiing|skier]] at the top of the screen, while the background graphics scroll upwards, thus giving the illusion the skier is moving.  The player must avoid obstacles, such as [[tree]]s and [[Mogul skiing#Moguls|moguls]].  The game cartridge contains five variations each of two principal games.

In the downhill mode, the player's goal is to reach the bottom of the ski course as rapidly as possible, while a timer records his relative success.

In the [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] mode, the player must similarly reach the end of the course as rapidly as he can, but must at the same time pass through a series of gates (indicated by a pair of closely spaced flagpoles). Each gate missed counts as a penalty against the player's time.<ref name="manual">{{cite web |title=Skiing Manual |url=https://archive.org/details/Skiing_1980_Activision |website=archive.org |date=1980}}</ref>

==Promotion==
''Skiing'' was promoted via a 30-second TV commercial featuring a man demonstrating how to play the game (including the various obstacles into which a player can crash), while speaking in a stereotypical French accent. The commercial ends with a close-up of the game box, with the man's voice heard off-screen (now speaking in a general American accent) saying, "I think I hurt myself," in reference to his numerous virtual crashes.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}
