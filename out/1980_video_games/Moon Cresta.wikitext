{{nihongo foot|'''''Moon Cresta'''''|ムーンクレスタ|Mūn Kuresuta|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[fixed shooter]] video game released by [[Nichibutsu]] for [[Arcade video game|arcades]] in 1980. In North America, it was licensed to [[Sega]]/[[Gremlin Industries|Gremlin]]<ref name="cashbox">{{cite news |title=Coin Machine - Manufacturers Equipment |url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox43unse_16/page/37 |accessdate=29 February 2020 |work=[[Cash Box (magazine)|Cash Box]] |date=19 September 1981 |page=37}}</ref> and [[Centuri]], the latter releasing it in arcades as '''''Eagle'''''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Moon Cresta screenshot.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot]]
The player begins the game with a small spaceship armed with a single laser cannon. After successfully completing the first four waves of alien attacks, the player must attempt to dock the ship with the next 'stage' of the ship. This second stage has two lasers in addition to the original one. Each docked stage is one of the player's "lives".

After successfully clearing two more waves of aliens, the player must again dock with the third and final piece of the ship, which also has two more lasers (giving the player five lasers in total). The trade-off for this is that the entire ship is a much larger target. Failure to correctly align the stages during either docking sequence causes the destruction of the stage being docked with.

After completing the first eight waves, the player's ship reverts to the first stage and the process is repeated. If any of the player's three ships are lost along the way, the docking sequence occurs only after the first four waves have been completed. Play ends when all three of the player's ship-stages are destroyed.

''Moon Cresta'' helped propel Nichibutsu into the video game business, and it was one of their most successful arcade games.<ref name="HG101"/> In Japan, it was the fourth highest-earning [[1980 in video games|arcade game of 1980]], below ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Galaxian]]'' and ''[[Crazy Climber]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=ベストスリー 本紙調査 (調査対象1980年) 〜 アーケードゲーム機|trans-title=Best Three Book Survey (Survey Target 1980) ~ Arcade Game Machines|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=159|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 February 1981|page=2|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19810215p.pdf#page=2}}</ref>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' commented on the game's visuals for being bright and colorful, and its gameplay for being captivating.<ref name="CVG">{{cite news |title=Arcade - Moon Cresta: Keep On Docking |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/162/436 |accessdate=29 February 2020 |agency=[[Computer & Video Games]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |date=March 1982 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202105751/https://solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/162/436 |archivedate=2 February 2019 |location=United Kingdom |page=26}}</ref> ''Game Machine'' felt the same way, recognizing it as a sure-hit for arcades because of its gameplay and mechanics.<ref>{{cite news |title=ムーンクレスタ |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19800715p.pdf |accessdate=29 February 2020 |agency=Game Machine |publisher=Amusement Press, Inc. |date=15 July 1980 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620210626/https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19800715p.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2019 |page=2 |language=Japanese}}</ref>

The ZX Spectrum port published by [[Incentive Software]] was met with mixed reviews. ''[[Your Spectrum]]'' said that the gameplay was close to the arcade original, but felt that it was beginning to show its age.<ref name="YSpectrum"/> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' had a similar response, and commented that the only reason to even play it was to win a contest held by Incentive.<ref name="SUser"/> They said that the game was a good conversion of the original, but the gameplay itself was dated and not as fun as other games for the system.<ref name="SUser"/> ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' magazine was a lot more positive towards the game, awarding it a "Crash Smash" award;<ref name="Crash"/> they applauded it for its simplistic gameplay, accurate portrayal of the arcade game, and its overall addictiveness, saying: "At a time when the emphasis tends to be on complicated arcade/adventures or third generation platform games, I think it’s brave of Incentive to release an old fashioned shoot em up like this, and I'm thankful that they have. Great fun!"<ref name="Crash"/>

===Retrospective===
In 1998, ''[[Allgame]]'' said that while ''Moon Cresta'' had several unique ideas, particularly the ship docking mechanic "slick" controls, and its fast-paced action, it was ultimately hampered by its high difficulty level.<ref name="Allgame"/> They said that the tough gameplay would put off a lot of players: "Slick controls, distinctive graphics and almost-musical sound effects add up to a memorable package, but one which was too tough for some casual gamers to master".<ref name="Allgame"/> By contrast in 2007, ''[[Eurogamer]]'' greatly praised the game for its addictive nature, creativity, and overall challenge that helped set the standard for games to follow.<ref name="EuroG"/> They said: "I still, to this very day, admire ''Moon Cresta'' for being an adrenalin-fuelled, no nonsense shmup that epitomises the simplistic gaming challenges of early arcade games. Left, right and fire was all it took to take a young impressionable teenager from a world where potting the black was the challenge of the day".<ref name="EuroG"/>

In a 2016 retrospective review, ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' labeled ''Moon Cresta'' as being an influential and well-regarded shooter from the era.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Ragan |first1=Jess |title=Moon Cresta |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/moon-cresta/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=29 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121145950/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/moon-cresta/ |archivedate=21 November 2019 |date=9 July 2016}}</ref> They greatly praised the game's key differences from games like ''[[Galaxian]]'' and ''[[Galaga]]'', such as the ship docking mechanic.<ref name="HG101"/> ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' felt mixed towards the Super Famicom and PlayStation conversions, disliking both version's modifications to the enemy speed and other characteristics in the game, which they said might put off fans of the original.<ref name="HG101"/> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' felt the same way about the arcade original, saying that ''Moon Cresta'' had several differences that made it stand out from ''Galaxian'' and ''Galaga'', and that it was an entertaining and important game in its own right.<ref name="Retro Gamer"/> They praised the game's large layer of strategy and scoring, alongside the ship docking mechanic.<ref name="Retro Gamer"/> ''Retro Gamer'' concluded their review by writing: "By predating ''Galaga''{{'}}s multiple ship mechanic and introducing a range of diverse enemies, ''Moon Cresta'' is rightfully regarded as a key stage in the development of arcade shooters".<ref name="Retro Gamer">{{cite news |last1=Mason |first1=Graeme |title=The Definitive Moon Cresta |agency=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=175 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |date=30 November 2018 |location=United Kingdom |pages=38–43}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Moon Cresta'' spawned a series of sequels, spin-offs and alterations. [[Gremlin Industries]] released ''Super Moon Cresta'', a modification kit that allows the enemies to fire back at the level and changes some of the text.<ref name="Retro Gamer"/> Nichibutsu itself created ''Moon Quasar'', a spin-off that gives the second ship more firepower and a brief "refueling" segment, where the player must dock their vessel into a mothership towards the center of the screen.<ref name="Retro Gamer"/>

''Moon Cresta'' became the first installment of the ''Cresta Series'', which spans into 5 installments and two spinoffs. The first sequel to ''Moon Cresta'' was released in 1985, titled ''[[Terra Cresta]]''. It is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] where players collect different ship pieces that each provide a new weapon.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ragan |first1=Jess |title=Terra Cresta |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/terra-cresta/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=29 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121081231/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/terra-cresta/ |archivedate=21 November 2019 |date=9 July 2016}}</ref> The first spin-off game in the series, ''[[UFO Robo Dangar]]'', was released in 1986 that was similar to ''Terra Cresta'', where the player controls a giant [[mecha]] instead of a starship.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dangar Ufo Robo |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7506 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325035302/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7506 |archivedate=25 March 2019}}</ref> In 1987, Nichibutsu released ''Terra Force'', another spinoff game which adds horizontal-scrolling segments alongside the vertical-scrolling ones from ''Terra Cresta''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arcade Action - Terra Force |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/232/613 |accessdate=29 February 2020 |agency=[[Computer & Video Games]] |date=January 1988 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202105715/https://solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/232/613 |archivedate=2 February 2019 |location=United Kingdom |page=151}}</ref> A direct sequel to ''Terra Cresta'', titled ''[[Terra Cresta II: Mandler's Counterattack]]'', was released in 1992 for the [[PC Engine]] in Japan, adding new stage designs, additional bosses, and more weapons and power-ups to use.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ragan |first1=Jess |title=Terra Cresta II |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/terra-cresta-ii/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=16 November 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417084108/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/terra-cresta-ii/ |archivedate=17 April 2019 |date=13 August 2016}}</ref> A 3D follow-up, ''[[Terra Cresta 3D]]'', was released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn, being one of Nichibutu's final games;<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ragan |first1=Jess |title=Terra Cresta 3D |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/terra-cresta-3d/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=16 November 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507103924/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/terra-cresta-3d/ |archivedate=7 May 2019 |date=21 August 2016}}</ref> it serves as a 3D update to ''Terra Cresta'', with new stages and weapon types.<ref name="NG">{{cite news |title=Terra Cresta 3D |url=https://archive.org/details/NEXT_Generation_36 |accessdate=16 November 2019 |agency=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=36 |date=December 1997 |page=[https://archive.org/details/NEXT_Generation_36/page/n169 168]}}</ref> A fourth sequel, ''[[Sol Cresta]]'', was released in February 2022 by [[PlatinumGames]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oloman |first1=Jordan |title=PlatinumGames' April Fool Game, Sol Cresta, Is Real and Releases This Year |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/platinumgames-has-done-the-same-april-fools-joke-twice-in-a-row-so-is-it-a-joke |publisher=[[IGN]] |access-date=April 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210401122030/https://www.ign.com/articles/platinumgames-has-done-the-same-april-fools-joke-twice-in-a-row-so-is-it-a-joke |archive-date=April 1, 2021 |date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>
