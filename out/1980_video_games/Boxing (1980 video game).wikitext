'''''Boxing''''' is a [[video game]] interpretation of the sport of [[boxing]] developed by programmer [[Bob Whitehead]] for the Atari VCS (later renamed to the Atari 2600).<ref name="giantlist"/> It was published by [[Activision]] in 1980. It's one of the first video games developed by Activision. The game is based on ''Boxer'', an unreleased 1978 arcade game from Whitehead's previous employer, [[Atari, Inc.]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stilphen|first1=Scott|title=Bob Whitehead Interview|journal=The 2600 Connection|date=2005|url=http://www.2600connection.com/interviews/bob_whitehead/interview_bob_whitehead.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130092148/http://www.2600connection.com/interviews/bob_whitehead/interview_bob_whitehead.html|archive-date=Nov 30, 2016}}</ref> ''Boxer'' was written by [[Mike Albaugh]] who also wrote ''Drag Race'' for Atari, a game cloned by Activision as ''[[Dragster (video game)|Dragster]]''.<ref name="albaugh">{{cite web|last1=Spicer|first1=Dag|title=Mike Albaugh Interview|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2011/10/102743036-05-01-acc.pdf|website=Computer History Museum|date=November 12, 2010}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Boxing-Activision-2600.png|thumb|White is landing a punch on black]]

''Boxing'' shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black.  When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari [[joystick]]).  This causes his opponent to reel back slightly.  Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have elapsed (a "decision").  In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.

While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.

==Reception==
''Boxing'' was reviewed by ''Video'' magazine in its "Arcade Alley" column where it was described as "demonstrat[ing] Activision's willingness to strike out boldly in new directions" and praised for keeping things from "becoming needlessly complex" by making automatic punch-type selection for the player.<ref name=kunkel>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Laney |first2= Frank |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= December 1980 |title= Arcade Alley: A New Era Begins - Activision Exploits Atari's Success |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|pages= 12 and 105 |issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Boxing'' was made available on Microsoft's ''[[Game Room]]'' service in 2010.

In 2011, an extended academic version of the game, called ''Clever Boxer'', was developed as a benchmark for [[Game AI]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nasrinpour|first=Hamid Reza|last2=Malektaji|first2=Siavash|last3=Aliyari Shoorehdeli|first3=Mahdi|last4=Teshnehlab|first4=Mohammad | date=September 2011 | title= Deploying Fuzzy Logic in a Boxing Game Network| journal =  6th Annual International North-American Conference on AI and Simulation in Games (GameON-NA) | publisher = Eurosis | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273439355 | doi=10.13140/2.1.1110.3524 }}</ref>
