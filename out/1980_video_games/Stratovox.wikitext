'''''Stratovox''''', known in Japan as '''''Speak & Rescue''''' (スピーク&レスキュー), is a 1980 [[fixed shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published in Japan by [[Sunsoft|Sun Electronics]] and released in North America by [[Taito]]. It is the first video game with [[Speech synthesis|voice synthesis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615221800/http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-2|archivedate=2011-06-15|title=Gaming's Most Important Evolutions|page=2|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=October 8, 2010|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Adlum |first=Eddie |title=The Replay Years: Reflections from Eddie Adlum |magazine=RePlay |date=November 1985 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=134-175 (160-3) |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-11-issue-no.-2-november-1985-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2011%2C%20Issue%20No.%202%20-%20November%201985/page/162/mode/2up}}</ref> The player must shoot [[UFO]]s attempting to kidnap astronauts that appear on the right side of the screen. If all astronauts are kidnapped, the game is over.

Among the voices the player hears are the phrases "Help me, help me", "Very good!", "We'll be back", and "Lucky". The phrase "Help me" is played during [[attract mode]]. The Japanese version of the game features Japanese speech, such as 「助けて！」 ( "Tasukete!") instead of "Help Me!"

==Legacy==
''[[Bandits (video game)|Bandits]]'' from [[Sirius Software]] for the [[Apple II]] (1982) is a ''Stratovox'' clone where the player protects fruit instead of astronauts. ''[[Spider Fighter]]'' (1982) for the [[Atari 2600]] also has the player protecting fruit, and ''Digital Press'' described it as "much like the coin-op game ''Stratovox'' but w/o the voice."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Digital Press Virtual Collectors Guide|url=http://www.digitpress.com/video-game-guide/?mode=GameInfo&gameid=24229|website=Digital Press}}</ref>

===World record===
According to [[Twin Galaxies]], John Brissie, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, scored a world record 140,900 points on Stratovox on April 16, 2008.
