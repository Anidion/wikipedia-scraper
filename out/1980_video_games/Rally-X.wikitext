{{nihongo|'''''Rally-X'''''|ラリーX|Rarī-Ekkusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[List of maze video games|maze chase]] [[arcade video game]] developed in [[Japan]] and [[Germany]] by [[Namco]] and released in 1980. In [[North America]], it was distributed by [[Midway Games|Midway Manufacturing]] and in [[Europe]] by Karateco. Players drive a blue [[Formula One]] race car through a multidirectional scrolling maze to collect yellow flags. Boulders block some paths and must be avoided. Red enemy cars pursue the player in an attempt to collide with them. Red cars can be temporarily stunned by laying down [[smoke screens]] at the cost of fuel. ''Rally-X'' is one of the first games with [[bonus stage]]s and continuously-playing background music.

''Rally-X'' was designed as a successor to [[Sega]]'s ''[[Head On (video game)|Head On]]'' (1979), an earlier maze chase game with cars. It was a commercial success in Japan, where it was the sixth highest-grossing game of 1980, but [[Midway Manufacturing]] released the game in North America to largely underwhelming results. An often-repeated, though untrue, story involving its demonstration at the 1980 Amusement & Music Operators Association trade show, where the attending press believed ''Rally-X'' was of superior quality than the other games presented, specifically ''[[Pac-Man]]''. Though it was well-received by attendees, ''Rally-X'' failed to attract much attention during its presentation.

Reception for ''Rally-X'', both at release and retrospectively, has highlighted its technological accomplishments and high difficulty. Some reviewers have found it to be influential and ahead of its time. ''Rally-X'' received several remakes and sequels, beginning with the slightly tweaked ''[[New Rally-X]]'' in 1981. It is also included in several [[List of Bandai Namco video game compilations|Namco compilations]].

The game was a commercial success in Japan, where it became the sixth highest-grossing [[1980 in video games|arcade game of 1980]], and Namco's third highest that year below ''Pac-Man'' and ''[[Galaxian]]''.<ref name="GM159">{{cite magazine|title=ベストスリー 本紙調査 (調査対象1980年) 〜 アーケードゲーム機|trans-title=Best Three Book Survey (Survey Target 1980) ~ Arcade Game Machines|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=159|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 February 1981|page=2|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19810215p.pdf#page=2}}</ref> In contrast, the game was not as successful in North America.

''Rally-X'' has continued to earn praise in retrospective commentary.<ref name="EuroG"/><ref name="RGamer"/><ref name="PDF"/> Writing for ''[[Eurogamer]]'' in 2007, Sir Clive believed the game was unique enough to discern it from ''Pac-Man'' and similar maze-chasers. He identified its high difficulty and design, and that it gave an adrenaline rush to players. Clive commented: "When you are playing the game, just imaging a yellow circle where your car is and repeat the mantra 'wakawakawakawaka' as you play and you will start to see just how huge this game could have been".<ref name="EuroG"/> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' staff were positive towards its colorful graphics, smooth scrolling, and increasing level of difficulty, writing it makes for a unique derivative of ''Pac-Man'' and was worth playing in its own right.<ref name="RGamer"/> ''Phosphor Dot Fossils''{{'}}s Earl Green found its gameplay addictive and commented on its similarities to ''Pac-Man''.
