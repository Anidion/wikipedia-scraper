'''''Computer Bismarck''''' is a [[Wargame (video games)|computer wargame]] developed and published by [[Strategic Simulations|Strategic Simulations, Inc.]] (SSI) in 1980. The game is based on the [[last battle of the battleship Bismarck]], in which [[British Armed Forces]] pursue the German ''Bismarck'' in 1941. It is SSI's first game, and features [[Time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] gameplay and [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional graphics]].

The development staff consisted of two programmers, [[Joel Billings]] and John Lyons, who programmed the game in [[BASIC]]. Originally developed for the [[TRS-80]], an [[Apple II series|Apple II]] version was also created two months into the process. After meeting with other wargame developers, Billings decided to publish the game as well. To help accomplish this, he hired Louis Saekow to create the [[Video game packaging#Box art|box art]].

The first commercially published computer war game, ''Computer Bismarck'' sold well and contributed to SSI's success. Though it received a mixed reception, the game is credited in part for legitimizing war games and computer games.

During college, Joel  Billings used computers to do [[econometrics]], [[mathematical model]]ing and [[forecasting]]. This experience led him to believe that computers could handle war games and remove tedious paperwork from gameplay.<ref name="Antic-4-3">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]| title = War Games: The story of S.S.I.| first = Jack| last = Powell| volume = 4| issue = 3|date=July 1985| page =28 | url=https://archive.org/stream/1985-07-anticmagazine/Antic_Vol_4-03_1985-07_Computer_Challenges#page/n27/mode/2up }}</ref> While between his undergraduate and graduate education, Billings met an [[IBM]] programmer and discussed computers.<ref name="CGW-45">{{cite magazine| magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]]| title = Titans of the Computer Gaming World| first = Bob| last = Proctor| page =36|date=March 1988| issue = 45}}</ref><ref name="Antic-4-3"/> Billings suggested starting a software company with him, but the programmer was not interested in war games, stating that they were too difficult and complicated to be popular.<ref name="Antic-4-3"/> Billings posted flyers at hobby shops in the [[Santa Clara, California]] area to attract  war-game enthusiasts with a background in programming. John Lyons was the first to reply and joined Billings after quickly developing a good rapport.<ref name="CGW-45"/><ref name="RetroG-42"/><ref name="Antic-4-3"/>

Billings chose the ''Bismarck''{{'}}s last battle because he felt it would be easier to develop than other war games.<ref name="RetroG-42"/> ''Computer Bismarck'' was written in [[BASIC]] and [[Compiler|compiled]] to increase its processing speed.<ref name="RetroG-42"/><ref name="Antic-4-3"/> In August 1979, Billings provided Lyons with access to a computer to write the program. Lyons began programming a simplified version similar to a [[Fox games|fox and hounds game]]—he had "hounds" search a playing field for a "fox". At the time, the two were working [[Full-time job|full-time]] and programmed at Billings' apartment during the night. Lyons did the bulk of the programming, while Billings focused on design and assisted with data entry and minor programming tasks.<ref name="RetroG-42">{{Cite magazine|date=October 2007| title= Developer Lookback: Strategic Simulations Inc| first = Craig| last = Ritchie|magazine= [[Retro Gamer]]| publisher= [[Imagine Publishing]]| issue= 42| pages=34–39}}</ref>

The game was originally developed for the [[Tandy Corporation]]'s [[TRS-80]]. Two months into development, Billings met with [[Trip Hawkins]], then a marketing manager at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]], via a [[venture capital]]ist, who convinced Billings to develop the game for the {{Nowrap|Apple II}};<ref name="RetroG-42"/><ref name="Antic-4-3"/> he commented that the computer's capacity for color graphics made it the best platform for strategy games.<ref name="CGW-45"/> In October 1979, Billings' uncle gave him an {{Nowrap|Apple II}}. Billings and Lyons then converted their existing code to work on the {{Nowrap|Apple II}} and used a graphics software package to generate the game's map.<ref name="RetroG-42"/>

After Lyons began programming, Billings started to study the video games market. He visited local game stores and attended a San Francisco gaming convention. Billings approached Tom Shaw from [[Avalon Hill]]—the company produced many war games that Billings played as a child—and one of the founders of [[Epyx|Automated Simulations]] to share market data, but aroused no interest. The lukewarm responses made Billings believe he would have to publish SSI's games. After ''Computer Bismarck'' was finished in January 1980, he searched for a graphic designer to handle the game's packaging.<ref name="RetroG-42"/>
 
Billings met Louis Saekow through a string of friends but was hesitant to hire him. Inspired by Avalon Hill's games, Billings wanted SSI's games to look professional and include maps, detailed manuals, and excellent box art. Two months prior, Saekow had postponed [[medical school]] to pursue his dream of becoming a graphic designer. To secure the job, Saekow told Billings that he could withhold pay if the work was unsatisfactory. In creating the box art, Saekow used a [[stat camera]]; his roommate worked for a magazine company and helped him sneak in to use its camera after hours. Saekow's cousin then handled printing the packaging.<ref name="RetroG-42"/> Without any storage for the complete products, Billings stored the first {{Nowrap|2,000 boxes}} in his bedroom.<ref name="CGW-45"/><ref name="RetroG-42"/> In February 1980, he distributed {{Nowrap|30,000 flyers}} to {{Nowrap|Apple II}} owners, and displayed the game at the Applefest exposition a month later.<ref name="CGW-45"/> SSI purchased a full-page advertisement for the {{nowrap|Apple II}} version in the March 1980 issue of ''[[BYTE]]'' magazine, which mentioned the ability to [[saved game|save a game in progress]] as well as play against the computer or another person. The advertisement also promised future support for the TRS-80 and other computers.<ref name="ssi198004">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1980-03/1980_03_BYTE_05-03_Computers_in_the_Labratory#page/n167/mode/2up | title=Sink the Bismarck with your Apple!

== Reception and legacy ==
In 1980, Peter Ansoff of ''BYTE'' magazine called ''Computer Bismarck'' a "milestone in the development of commercial war games", and approved of the quality of the documentation and the option to play against the computer, but disapproved of the game. Acknowledging that "it is perhaps unfair to expect the first published [computer war game] to be a fully developed product", he criticized ''Computer Bismarck'' for overly faithfully copying the mechanics of the ''Bismarck'' board game, including those that worked efficiently on a board but less so on a computer. Ansoff also noted that the computer game "perpetuates the [board game's] irritating system of ship-movement rates", and concluded that "the failings of ''Computer Bismarck'' can be summarized by saying that it does not take advantage of the possibilities offered by the computer".<ref name="ansoff198012">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1980-12/1980_12_BYTE_05-12_Adventure#page/n283/mode/2up | title=Computer Bismarck | work=BYTE | date=December 1980 | access-date=18 October 2013 | author=Ansoff, Peter A | pages=262–266}}</ref> ''[[Moves (magazine)|Moves]]'' magazine reviewer Ian Chadwick called it "engrossing" and praised the simulation's accuracy. While noting the excessive amount of time required to play a single game, Chadwick noted that ''Computer Bismarck'' requires patience and some gameplay changes could have reduced this time. He called the graphics "poorly drawn", but conceded that good visuals are not necessary.<ref name="moves-56">{{cite magazine| magazine = [[Moves (magazine)|Moves]]| publisher=Strategy and Tactic Press | title = Computer Bismarck| first = Ian| last = Chadwick| pages=28–29| date = April 1981| issue = 56 | url=https://strategyandtacticspress.com/library-files/Moves%20Issue56.pdf}}</ref>

The game was better received by other critics. Neil Shapiro of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' that year praised the game's detail and ability to recreate the complex maneuvering involved in the real battle. He referred to it as unique and "fantastic".<ref name="PopMech-154-2">{{cite magazine| first = Neil| last = Shapiro| title = PM Electronics Monitor: Have your own war room|magazine= [[Popular Mechanics]]| page =13|date=August 1980| volume = 154| issue = 2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9QDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13 }}</ref> In ''[[Creative Computing]]'', Randy Heuer cautioned that the game "is probably not for everyone. The point which I probably cannot emphasize enough is that it is an extremely complex simulation ... However, for those ready for a [challenge] ... I enthusiastically recommend ''Computer Bismarck''".<ref name="heuer198008">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1980-08/Creative_Computing_v06_n08_1980_Aug#page/n33/mode/2up | title=Computer Bismarck | work=Creative Computing | date=August 1980 | access-date=18 October 2013 | author=Heuer, Randy |page=31}}</ref> Reviewing ''Computer Bismarck'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' magazine, Joseph T. Suchar called the game "superb" and stated that "it has so many strategic options for both sides that it is unlikely to be optimized."<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Suchar|first=Joseph T. |date=July 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=29|pages=29–30}}</ref>

United States Navy defense researcher Peter Perla in 1990 considered war games like ''Computer Bismarck'' a step above earlier war-themed video games that relied on arcade-style action. He praised the addition of a computer-controlled opponent that such games provide to solitaire players. Perla attributes SSI's success to the release of its early wargames, specifically citing ''Computer Bismarck''.<ref name="ArtOfWargaming">{{cite book| first = Peter P.| last = Perla| title = The Art of Wargaming| publisher = Naval Institute Press| pages = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780870210501/page/151 151–152]| year = 1990| isbn = 0-87021-050-5| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780870210501/page/151}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s Bob Proctor in 1988 agreed that ''Computer Bismarck'' contributed to SSI's success, commenting that the title earned the company a good profit. He also stated that it encouraged game enthusiasts to submit their own games to SSI, which he believed helped further the company's success. Describing it as the first "serious wargame for a microcomputer", Proctor credited ''Computer Bismarck'' with helping to legitimize war games and computer games in general. He stated that the professional packaging demonstrated SSI's seriousness to produce quality products;<ref name="CGW-45"/> prior to ''Computer Bismarck'', most computer games were packaged in [[zipper storage bag]]s.<ref name="CGW-45"/><ref name="RetroG-42"/> Saekow became a permanent SSI employee and designed artwork for most of its products.<ref name="RetroG-42"/>

Ansoff noted the similarity of the game's mechanics to Avalon Hill's ''Bismarck'', stating that "it would seem proper as a matter of courtesy to acknowledge that the game was based on an Avalon Hill design".{{r|ansoff198012}} Chadwick also noted the similarities to Avalon Hill's board game.<ref name="moves-56"/> In 1983, Avalon Hill took legal action against SSI for copying game mechanics from its board games; ''Computer Bismarck'', among other titles, was involved in the case. The two companies settled the issue out of court.<ref name="HighScore"/> The game was later re-released as part of the company's "SSI classics" line of popular games at discounted prices.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]| title = New Products| author = Antic Staff| volume = 5| issue = 10|date=February 1987| page =31 | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v5n10/newproducts.html }}</ref> One of SSI's later games, ''[[Pursuit of the Graf Spee (video game)|Pursuit of the Graf Spee]]'', uses an altered version of ''Computer Bismarck''{{'}}s core system.<ref name="Antic-4-3"/><ref name="CC-9-7">{{cite magazine|magazine= [[Creative Computing]]| publisher = [[Ziff Davis]]| title = Warfare in the Atlantic| first = Brian J.| last = Murphy| volume = 9| issue = 7|date=July 1983| page =76}}</ref><ref name="CGW2-1">{{cite magazine| magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]]| author = Computer Gaming World Staff| title = Hobby and Industry News| page =2|date=January–February 1982| volume =2| issue = 1}}</ref> In December 2013 the [[International Center for the History of Electronic Games]] received a software donation of several SSI games, including Computer Bismarck with the source code for preservation.<ref name="ICHEGSSI">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/207137/Strategic_Simulations_Inc_founder_donates_company_collection_to_ICHEG.php |title= Strategic Simulations, Inc. founder donates company collection to ICHEG|date=2013-12-16| first=Christian |last=Nutt |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |access-date=22 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="ICHEGSSI2">{{cite web |url=http://www.icheg.org/blog/chegheads/2013/12/the-strategic-simulations-inc-collection/ |title=The Strategic Simulations, Inc.
