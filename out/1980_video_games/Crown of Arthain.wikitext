==Reception==
John Morrison reviewed ''Crown of Arthain'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 49.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal |last=Morrison |first=John |date=March 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews |journal=[[The Space Gamer]] |publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]] |issue=49 |pages=33â€“34}}</ref> Morrison commented that "''Crown of Arthain'' would have made a fair two-player game if the monster frequency was reduced drastically. Also, the price is a tad high. As a one-player game it has nothing to recommend it. I recommend it as-is only to rich gamers who'll buy anything."<ref name="SG"/>
