==Reception==
Alan Isabelle reviewed ''Bill Budge's Space Album'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 33.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Isabelle |first=Alan |date=November 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=33|pages=36}}</ref> Isabelle wrote that "the first three games are very entertaining.

Ian Chadwick reviewed ''Bill Budge's Space Album'' in ''[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]]'' #11 and commented that "despite the simplicity of the games, this is exciting stuff and lots of fun to play. The highlight of the game is Budge's graphics, which continue to improve with each game he produces. It's a game of paddles and fast reflexes, and having four games in one package allows a lot of variation in one sitting. Good stuff and well worth the money".<ref name="Ares">{{cite journal | last=Chadwick | first=Ian | title=Games | journal=[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]] | publisher=[[Simulations Publications, Inc.]] | date=November 1981 | issue=11 | page=27}}</ref>
