'''''Dogfight''''' is an aerial combat [[video game]] written by Bill Basham for the [[Apple II]] and published by Micro Lab in 1980.  The game is a clone of [[Atari, Inc.]]'s 1975 arcade game ''[[Jet Fighter (video game)|Jet Fighter]]''.

==Gameplay==
The player controls an aircraft  that always moves in the direction is it pointed and can be rotated left or right and shoot. The screen [[wraparound (video games)|wraps around]] at the edges, such that a player heading off the right edge of the screen will re-enter from the left.

Players can play solo against the computer or up to 8 humans can play against each other. Since all input is via the single built-in keyboard of the Apple II, this involves the players crowding up against each other to reach their 3 keys. Each plane is identified by a number drawn next to it.

When a plane is shot, it becomes a parachuting figure, which transits the screen from top to bottom a few times and also may be shot.

==Development==
The game was written by Bill Basham in [[Rockford, Illinois]]. He began programming the Apple II in  [[machine language]] and wanted to explore [[Computer animation|animation]]. He was able to smoothly animate up to 56 items on the screen at the same time, optimized with a [[lookup table]].<ref name=gue>{{cite web |title=Dogfight |url=http://gue.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?pub=0&item=43&id=2&key=0 |website=Gallery of Undiscovered Entities |accessdate=5 June 2020}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Programmer Bill Basham: "After writing ''Dogfight'' and publishing it through Microlab, I went on to write Diversi-DOS. Microlab wasn't selling ''Dogfight'' by then, so I decided to include it as a freebee with Diversi-DOS".<ref name=gue/><ref>{{cite web |title=Diversi Copy |url=https://archive.org/details/148_Diversi-Copy |website=Internet Archive |publisher=DSR |accessdate=5 June 2020}}</ref>

''Dogfight II'' is a 1981 update with support for the Joyport device and two new game modes: multiplayer and anti-aircraft gunner.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dogfight II |url=https://archive.org/details/wozaday_Dogfight_II |website=Internet Archive |date=12 October 2019 |publisher=Microlab |accessdate=5 June 2020}}</ref>
