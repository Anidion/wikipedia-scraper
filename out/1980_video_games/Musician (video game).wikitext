'''''Musician''''' is cartridge number 31 in the official Magnavox/Philips line of games for the [[Philips Videopac]]. It came in a cardboard box roughly double the size of a standard Videopac game box, containing a keyboard overlay in the style of a piano keyboard; the cartridge, in a standard Videopac box with a single sheet where the manual would usually be; and a [[landscape format]] manual, over double the size of a standard game manual.

The purpose of the set is to turn the user's Videopac into a [[musical keyboard]]. It supports recording and editing sequences of up to 81 notes, although there is no way to save apart from writing a composition down on music manuscript. In the manual there are the following pieces of sheet music:

* "[[Badinerie]]" (Bach)
* "Brother Jacob"
* "[[The Entertainer (rag)|The Entertainer]]"
* "[[Eurovision_(network)#Transmission_ident|Eurovision Tune]]"
* "[[Happy Birthday to You]]"
* "[[Liebesträume|Liebestraum]]" (Liszt)
* "Lightly Row"
* "[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]"
* "[[Michael Row the Boat Ashore]]"
* "Mosocow Night"
* "[[Old McDonald Had a Farm]]"
* "[[This Old Man]]"
* "Three Young Drummers"
* "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]"
