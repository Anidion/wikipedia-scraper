'''''Midway Campaign''''' is a [[computer wargame]] released by [[Avalon Hill]] in 1980. It is a [[text-based game]] written in [[BASIC]].

==Gameplay==
The game reenacts the events between June 4 and June 7, 1942, during the [[Battle of Midway]], which was the turning point for Allied Forces in the Pacific Theater. 

Gameplay is turn-based with each turn representing one hour of the battle. Players control Task Force 16, comprising the [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]] and [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|Hornet]] aircraft carriers, and Task Force 17 comprising [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|Yorktown]], and [[Midway Island]]. 

Each task force may be moved on a map in any direction by providing a direction in degrees. During each turn [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Consolidated PBY Catalinas]] scout out the location of the enemy task force comprising [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|Soryu]], and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|Hiryu]].

Once a Task Force has been identified and are within range a strike group may be launched from neighboring ships. Planes are generally in three conditions throughout the game. They can be below deck (protected from enemy strikes), on deck arming for a strike, or in the air moving towards or away from a target. Fighters ([[F4F Wildcat]]s or [[A6M Zero]] 'Zekes') can also be established in a combat air patrol (CAP) to protect their carrier.

The game ends when either sides carriers are all lost, or if one of the task forces leave the map.
