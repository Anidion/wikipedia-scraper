'''''Ball''''' (originally known as ''Toss-Up'' in North America) is a Game & Watch game released as a part of the Silver series on April 28, 1980. It was the first Game & Watch game released, and has been released a number of times over the years in a number of ways. Multiple games and accessories feature ''Ball'' as an [[Easter egg (video games)|Easter egg]], including the [[Game Boy Camera]] and ''Kanji Sonomama DS Rakubiki Jiten''. It also frequently appeared in the ''[[Game & Watch Gallery]]'' series, which both compiles Game & Watch games and remakes them with ''[[Mario (series)|Mario]]'' characters. It was also released for the [[DSi]] on the DSi Shop as an individual game along with several other Game & Watch games.

==Gameplay==
''Ball'' is displayed on a single-screen Game & Watch system, and offers players two ways to play it. In Game A, players have to juggle two balls at a time. As the balls fall, players must move the juggler's hands to catch them, earning a point for each successful catch. The objective is to continuously catch the balls that fall and throw them back up, and if a single ball is dropped, the game ends. In Game B, players must juggle three balls at a time, with each successful catch rewarding ten points instead of one. In addition to the normal gameplay, ''Ball'' also has a clock.<ref name="ia"/>

==Development==
The concept of the [[Game & Watch]] was first conceived when creator [[Gunpei Yokoi]] saw someone playing with a calculator on the [[Shinkansen]].<ref name="ia"/> He described the development of ''Ball'' as "lateral thinking of withered technology", which journalist Laura Crigger explains as meaning the use of "mature technology in novel or radical applications".<ref name="handbook"/> LCD screens were both accessible and affordable at the time, and while people at Nintendo wanted to use technology that would increase battery life and be more expensive, Yokoi sought for it to be affordable. Yokoi also elected to use [[button cell]] [[Electric battery|batteries]] due to being inexpensive and small.<ref name="handbook"/> ''Ball'' was originally planned as a one-off concept by Yokoi. However, then-President [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] asked that he also come up with 2-3 more ideas for Game & Watch games. Yokoi felt ''Ball'' was difficult enough to come up with, but he agreed to do so.<ref name="shmup">{{cite web |url=https://shmuplations.com/gameandwatch/ |title=Gunpei Yokoi – Inventing the Game and Watch |work=Shmuplations |accessdate=April 20, 2023}}</ref> ''Ball'' was developed by [[Nintendo Research & Development 1]] and published by [[Nintendo]].<ref name="ia"/> Game designer [[Makoto Kano (video game designer)|Makoto Kano]] worked on the visuals and LCD design, and when he joined development of ''Ball'', Yokoi and former [[Nintendo Research & Engineering]] general manager [[Satoru Okada]] had already begun work on the game's prototype.<ref name="ia"/>

The ''Ball'' Game & Watch unit was designed with a chip that is capable of displaying segments which can be turned on or off. The upper-right-hand corner of the screen has a score and time display, which uses 28 segments of the system in total. The remaining 44 segments were used to display the actual gameplay.<ref name="ia"/> The decision to display the time was made at the end of development, which Kano speculated was an afterthought due to the lack of a colon in the display, though he also speculated that it may have been to save on segment use.<ref name="ia"/> The Game & Watch unit used a [[crystal oscillator]] to add the clock.<ref name="ia"/> They intentionally capped the score at 1999 in order to be able to use the segments as efficiently as possible.<ref name="ia"/> When designing ''Ball'' and other Game & Watch games, it was important to the designers that players feel like missing the ball did not feel unfair. To do this, they tried to design the game in such a way that what could be perceived as a miss is recognized as a success.<ref name="ia"/> The LCD display prevented multiple games from being made as part of one Game & Watch. To alleviate this issue, the designers opted to have two modes of play to increase the game's value.<ref name="handbook"/> One quirk of the hardware is that wiring is sticking out on the left and right sides of the screen. To hide this, the team printed black bars and added them on both sides of the screen.<ref name="ia"/>

==Release==
''Ball'' was the first [[Game & Watch]] game, launching on April 28, 1980 in the Silver series of Game & Watch systems.<ref name="ia">{{cite web |url=https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/clubn/game-and-watch-ball-reward/0/1/ |title=Iwata Asks - Game & Watch |work=[[Nintendo]] |last=Iwata |first=Satoru |accessdate=April 20, 2023}}</ref><ref name="dsfb"/> The Silver series was named for both the silver handheld color as well as the LCD screen, and four other Game & Watch games were released in this series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a34659956/every-nintendo-game-and-watch-edition-photos/ |title=How the Game & Watch Handheld Console Shaped Nintendo for Generations |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |last=Sherill |first=Cameron |date=November 13, 2020 |accessdate=April 20, 2023}}</ref> It was originally called ''Toss-Up'' in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/article/nintendo-game-watch-super-mario-bros-review |title=Nintendo's 'Super Mario' Game & Watch is a little piece of history.

Yokoi notes that the release of three Game & Watch titles in short succession, as well as how much they sold, created expectations that more would follow, resulting in yet more Game & Watch games being developed.<ref name="shmup"/>

===Re-releases and compilations===
The final Game & Watch game, ''[[Mario the Juggler]]'', released in 1991, was a remake of ''Ball''. The visuals were updated to be in color and have details from ''Mario'' video games, including [[Mario]] being the featured character.<ref name="handbook">{{cite book |title=Videogames Hardware Handbook |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=[[United Kingdom]] |last=McFarren |first=Damien |year=2016 |pages=34–40 |isbn=978-1785462399}}</ref>

''Ball'' was recreated in ''[[Game & Watch ports and remakes#Game Boy Gallery|Game Boy Gallery]]'' and ''[[Game & Watch ports and remakes#Game & Watch Gallery|Game & Watch Gallery]]'' for Game Boy and ''[[Game & Watch ports and remakes#Game & Watch Gallery 2|Game & Watch Gallery 2]]'' for Game Boy Color.

It was re-released exclusively via [[Club Nintendo]] to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ''Game & Watch'', with the Club Nintendo logo on the back. Unlike the original release, this version includes an option to mute the game by pressing the Time button during gameplay.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game & Watch|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/clubn/game-and-watch-ball-reward/0/4|website=Iwata Asks|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=1 November 2014}}</ref> Kano was a central figure in the development of the Club Nintendo version, who described it as "[holding] a special place in Yokoi-san's heart" and being the basis for all future Game & Watch games.<ref name="ia"/> There were some challenges involved according to Kano, due to documents relating to the original game's design no longer being available or difficult to find, despite the game having been recreated in the ''Game & Watch Gallery'' series.<ref name="ia"/> Another complication was the fact that the hardware used to make Game & Watch systems back in the 1980s aren't available anymore.<ref name="ia"/> Kano also cited poor memory as a complication, being unable to explain why a certain part is designed a certain way in some cases.<ref name="ia"/> He made efforts to recreate the experience of holding the original unit as much as he possibly could in terms of how it feels to hold, how it sounds, and how the buttons feel.<ref name="ia"/> Newer LCD screens would not show the wiring, meaning that the black bars on the screen were no longer necessary, but they were kept for the sake of making the design more authentic.<ref name="ia"/>

For members of the Japanese Club Nintendo, it was shipped in April 2010 to Platinum members.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Spencer|title=Platinum Club Nintendo Members Get Game & Watch|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2009/11/18/platinum-club-nintendo-members-get-game-watch/|website=Siliconera|publisher=Curse|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=November 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=McWhertor|first1=Michael|title=Club Nintendo Offers Members Actual Game & Watch Prize|url=http://kotaku.com/5407784/club-nintendo-offers-members-actual-game--watch-prize|website=Kotaku|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=November 18, 2009}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} It became available for members of the North American Club Nintendo in February 2011 and for European Club Nintendo members in November 2021.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Winterhalter|first1=Ryan|title=Club Nintendo offering Game & Watch replica|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/club-nintendo-offering-game-watch-replica/|website=gamesradar|publisher=Future|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=February 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Game & Watch: Ball |url=https://club.nintendo.com/rewards-details/a/15515.do |work=North American Club Nintendo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627025159/https://club.nintendo.com/rewards-details/a/15515.do |archivedate=June 27, 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=James|title=Game & Watch Gifts Added to European Club Nintendo|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2011/11/game_and_watch_gifts_added_to_european_club_nintendo|website=Nintendo Life|date=28 November 2011 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Game & Watch: Ball|url=http://stars.nintendo-europe.com/products/game--watch-ball-11|website=European Club Nintendo|publisher=Nintendo Europe|accessdate=2 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141102110927/http://stars.nintendo-europe.com/products/game--watch-ball-11|archivedate=2 November 2014}}</ref>

More recently, a [[Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros.|''Super Mario Bros.'']]-themed Game & Watch system was released on November 13, 2020. In addition to featuring the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and the sequel, ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'', it also featured a version of ''Ball'' reskinned to have a Mario head in place of the nondescript character.<ref name="gizmodo">{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/nintendos-adorable-retro-handheld-would-be-perfect-with-1845692649 |title=Nintendo's Adorable Retro Handheld Would Be Perfect With More Games |work=[[Gizmodo]] |last=Liszewski |first=Andrew |date=November 17, 2020 |accessdate=April 20, 2023}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Ball'' received generally mixed reception from contemporary critics. An article by ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' called it basic in comparison to later Game & Watch games, the gameplay called "unsophisticated" and the LCD characters "crude". He also noted the similarity between ''Ball'' and the later Game & Watch game ''[[Mario the Juggler]]''.<ref name="nl">{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/feature_how_nintendos_game_and_watch_took_withered_technology_and_turned_it_into_a_million-seller |title=Feature: How Nintendo's Game & Watch Took "Withered Technology" And Turned It Into A Million-Seller |work=[[Nintendo Life]] |last=McFarren |first=Damien |date=January 1, 2021 |accessdate=April 20, 2023}}</ref> Fellow ''Nintendo Life'' writer Jon Wahlgren was highly critical of the DSiWare release of ''Ball'', finding the gameplay and concept uninteresting. He felt that the only value was for people interested in it from a historical point of view.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/04/game_and_watch_ball_dsiware |title=Game & Watch Ball Review (DSiWare) |work=[[Nintendo Life]] |last=Wahlgren |first=Jon |date=April 20, 2010 |accessdate=April 20, 2023}}</ref> ''[[IGN]]'' writer Lucas M. Thomas was also critical of this release, saying that while the game may be the "most nostalgic" Game & Watch game, it wasn't worth the price it was being sold for on the DSi Shop due to how simple it is.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/27/dsiware-capsule-reviews-third-week-of-july?page=17 |title=DSiWare Capsule Reviews: Third Week of July |work=[[IGN]] |last=Thomas |first=Lucas M. |date=July 27, 2010 |accessdate=April 20, 2023}}</ref> ''[[MTV]]'' writer Jason Cipriano felt it got boring quickly, but appreciated the opportunity to experience the original Game & Watch game to see how the series progressed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mtv.com/news/93n4mw/game-watch-revival-30-years-later-and-still-ringin |title=Game & Watch Revival - 30 Years Later And Still Ringin' |work=[[MTV.com]] |last=Cipriano |first=Jason |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=April 20, 2023}}</ref> On the other hand, an author for ''Digitally Downloaded'' felt that, despite the simplicity, they loved it due to representing Nintendo's creativity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2017/03/on-game-watch-and-why-we-need-to.html |title=on-game-watch-and-why-we-need-to |work=Digitally Downloaded |date=March 16, 2017 |accessdate=April 20, 2023}}</ref>

In a review of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' version, ''Gizmodo'' writer Andrew Liszewski felt that the unit had "nostalgic charm" but it quickly wore off, stating that he would likely never play it again. He also felt that the unit itself was overpriced, citing the fact that one of the games - ''Ball'' - was particularly basic.<ref name="gizmodo"/> ''[[Den of Geek]]'' writer Aaron Potter agreed that it was simple but still found it fun to play, if only for a short time. He appreciated how, despite changing the character to Mario, it still felt authentic.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/games/game-watch-super-mario-bros-review/ |title=Game & Watch Super Mario Bros Review |work=[[Den of Geek]] |last=Potter |first=Aaron |date=November 16, 2020 |accessdate=April 20, 2023}}</ref>
