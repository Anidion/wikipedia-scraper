'''''Morloc's Tower''''' is a video game in the ''[[Dunjonquest]]'' series published by [[Epyx|Automated Simulations]] in 1980.

==Gameplay==
The tower has six stories and consists of 30 rooms total. ''Morloc's Tower'' has more pronounced [[adventure game]] elements, as some of the treasures found in the dungeon have to be used for a specific purpose.<ref name="byte-morloc">{{cite journal | title= Morloc's Tower | journal=BYTE | date=December 1980 | first=Greg | last=Williams | pages=70–71}}</ref> The player character is again predefined as Brian Hammerhand.<ref name="compute-morloc">{{cite journal | title= MicroQuest/Simulation | journal=Compute! | date=January–February 1980 | first=Len| last=Lindsay| page=5}}</ref> Morloc himself is the first boss enemy in the series, who has to be defeated within 45 minutes after starting the game.

==Reception==
Gregg Williams for ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' said "The game takes place in real time, which means you have to act quickly in fights. This makes the game a lot more interesting than most Adventures."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1980-12|title=Byte Magazine Volume 05 Number 12 - Adventure|date=December 15, 1980|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Len Lindsay for ''[[Compute!]]'' said "Automated Simulations hopes that after playing Morloc's Tower, you will want to try their own simulation games. As for myself, I can't wait till the next one is released."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/1980-01-compute-magazine|title=Compute! Magazine Issue 002|date=January 15, 1980|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

The ''Book of Atari Software 1983'' rated the game a B+ overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/ataribooks-the-book-of-atari-software-1983|title=Book of Atari Software 1983, The (1983)(The Book Company)|date=October 15, 1983|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
