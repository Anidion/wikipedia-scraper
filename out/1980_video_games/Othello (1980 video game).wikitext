'''''Othello''''' is a 1980 video game developed and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] for its Atari Video Computer System (later called the [[Atari 2600]]). It is based on the variant of [[Reversi]] of the same name, originally created in 1971.<ref name="TV Gamer">{{cite magazine|last1=Davis|first1=R.P.|date=Autumn 1983|title=Othello|url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/magazines/tv_gamer/tv_gamer_autumn83.pdf|url-status=live|magazine=TV Gamer|page=31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191123010945/http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/magazines/tv_gamer/tv_gamer_autumn83.pdf|archive-date=23 November 2019|access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref><ref name="Lapetino" /><ref name="Weiss">{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Brett|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYNUAAAAMAAJ&q=Othello+Atari|title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984 A Complete Reference Guide|date=2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0786432264|page=87|access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> The VCS game was programmed by [[Ed Logg]] and [[Carol Shaw]].

==Gameplay==

The game broadly resembles the game originally developed by [[Parker Brothers]] in that it is set on an 8x8 board on which the player must capture squares by sandwiching their opponent's counters between their own.<ref name="TV Gamer" /> The game has four skill levels.<ref name=manual/> Both one-player and competitive two-player modes are included in the game.<ref name="manual"/> The player can create their own problem by depositing pieces on the board, and select whether to go first or not.<ref name="Tilt">{{cite magazine|date=January 1983|title=Atari: Reduire ses prises|language=French|pages=30–31|magazine=Tilt|issue=3|url=https://archive.org/details/Tilt003/page/n29/mode/2up?q=Othello|access-date=22 February 2021}}</ref>

==Development==
The game was programmed by Ed Logg, who had studied artificial intelligence at the [[Stanford University]] AI Lab,<ref name="Rouse">{{cite book |last1=Rouse |first1=Richard |title=Game Design Theory & Practice |date=2001 |publisher=Wordware Pub. |pages=100–101, 120 |isbn=9781556227356 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oEv_RypcojwC&q=%22Othello%22+%22Atari%22 |access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> and Carol Shaw, who later created ''[[River Raid]]''.

==Reception==
A review in the Autumn 1983 edition of UK magazine ''TV Gamer'' criticised the AI, saying that, "the computer can manage only average ability even at its highest level of play", and that by that point the game was showing its age, but also said that the game would suit those who enjoyed that kind of strategy game.<ref name="TV Gamer" /> ''[[Electronic Games]]'' editors Arnie Katz and [[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]] assessed the game as "moderately challenging", calling the AI "a fair, if unexceptional, opponent."<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Arnie|url=https://archive.org/details/book_players_strategy_guide/page/n27/mode/2up?view=theater|title=The Player's Strategy Guide to Atari VCS Home Video Games|last2=Kunkel|first2=Bill|publisher=Dell Publishing, Reese Publishing|year=1982|isbn=0-440-17058-3|location=New York|pages=36|author-link2=Bill Kunkel (journalist)}}</ref> Conversely, a review in the 1983 ''Book of Atari Software'' described the game as "a very sophisticated and challenging game" and gave the game a rating of "A" overall.<ref name="Stanton et al">{{cite journal |last1=Stanton |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Wells |first2=Robert P. |last3=Rochowansky |first3=Sandra |title=The Book of Atari Software 1983 |journal=The Book of Atari Software |date=1983 |publisher=The Book Company |issn=0736-2706 |page=328 |url=https://archive.org/details/ataribooks-the-book-of-atari-software-1983/page/n329/mode/2up?q=baseball |access-date=20 February 2021}}</ref>

A review in the January 1983 issue of ''Tilt'', the French video-games magazine, was broadly positive, particularly praising the ability to set up a problem before starting the game as an advantage over other electronic games of ''Othello'', though it noted that the "expert" difficulty setting merely equated to the level of a good beginner.<ref name="Tilt" /> Conversely, a review in the Autumn 1983 issue of ''Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games'' was praising of the AI, describing the opponent on "Expert" setting as "capable of beating the pants off of you".<ref name="Koppin">{{cite magazine|last1=Koppin|first1=Martha|date=Autumn 1983|title=Othello|url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/magazines/ccvag/ccvag_fall83.pdf|magazine=Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games|volume=1|issue=2|page=72|access-date=23 February 2021}}</ref>
