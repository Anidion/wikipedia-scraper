'''''Apple-Oids''''' (also written as '''''Apple-oids''''') is a clone of [[Atari, Inc.]]'s ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' arcade video game. It was written by Tom Luhrs for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and published by [[California Pacific Computer Company]] in 1980. The asteroids in ''Apple-oids'' are in the shape of apples.<ref name="SG"/>

==Gameplay==
The ship is rotated with the paddle knob and propelled forward with the paddle button.<ref name=ahl/> Firing is done via the keyboard, with the asterisk key. Pressing any other key warps the ship to a random locationâ€”a.k.a. hyperspace.

==Reception==
Forrest Johnson reviewed ''Apple-Oids'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 42.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Johnson |first=Forrest |date=August 1981 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=42|pages=36}}</ref> Johnson commented that "I have never figured out why anyone would send a perfectly good ship to shoot at asteroids, but if that's your scene, you will enjoy this game".<ref name="SG"/>

In a ''[[Creative Computing]]'' review alongside ''The Asteroid Field'' and ''Asteron'', the authors concluded: "For those who like ''Asteroids'', any of these three games is a good choice".<ref name=ahl/>
