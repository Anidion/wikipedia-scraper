'''''Baseball''''' (released as '''''Major League Baseball''''', '''''Super Challenge Baseball''''', and '''''World Championship Baseball''''') is a [[sport video game]] produced by [[Mattel]] and released for the [[Intellivision]] [[home video game console]] in 1980. As the best-selling game in the console's history, with more than 1 million copies sold,<ref name="INTVlives"/> ''Baseball'' put players in control of a nine-man [[baseball]] team competing in a standard nine-inning game. When first released, Mattel obtained a license from [[Major League Baseball]], although the only trademarked item used is the MLB logo on the box art. No official team names or player names are in the game.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Baseball_(Intellivision_video_game)_Screenshot.png|thumb|left|''Super Challenge Baseball'' for Atari 2600]]
The game consists of nine innings on a simplified [[baseball diamond]]. The team having scored the most runs wins.

Player 1 is always the visiting team and bats at the top of the innings, with Player 2 as the home team and batting at the bottom of the innings. The pitching player selects a pitch by pushing the controller in one of eight cardinal directions, each representing a different speed and direction. The batting player then attempts to hit the ball into play and reach base safely, so that subsequent batters can move to [[home plate]] and thus score a run. If the ball is hit into play, the pitching player uses the keypad to select the fielder catch the ball, then selects the player to receive the throw, to put the runner "out".

The batting player is able to advance the base-runners off base in an attempt to [[Stolen base|steal a base]], but the pitching player can counter that with an attempt to [[pickoff]] the runners before the pitch is thrown.

If the score is tied at the end of the 9th inning, extra innings are played as necessary until a winner is determined.

===Variations from standard baseball===
Even though the two teams represented in ''Baseball'' are basically the same, the level of simulation is remarkable for its time. A wide array of baseball strategy includes [[Double play]]s, [[triple play]]s, [[rundown]]s, and [[Intentional base on balls|intentional walk]]s are all possible. Changes include all hits being automatically grounders, with no provisions for flyballs. Home runs depend on how and where the ball is hit.<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine=JoyStik |title=Major League Baseball |date=December 1982 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=12–15 |publisher=Publications International, Ltd. |url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/magazines/joystik/joystik_dec82.pdf |accessdate=27 February 2021}}</ref>

Another major change allows the batting player to score a run on a third out, if the base-runner reaches home plate before the third out takes place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/instructions/sports/baseball.txt|title=''Major League Baseball'' instructions|work=IntellivisionLives.com|access-date=2010-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030052923/http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/instructions/sports/baseball.txt|archive-date=2010-10-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, if the bases were loaded with two outs as the batter hits the ball into play, the runner on third base could score if a throw to third base [[force play|forcing out]] the runner from second base (thus, the third out) arrived after the runner on third crossed home plate but before the runner from second base reached third base.

==Reception==
''Baseball'' was reviewed by ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine in its "Arcade Alley" column where it was praised for its inclusion of moveable [[Baseball positions|fielders]] and "flashy" [[baserunning]] techniques like the [[Squeeze play (baseball)|suicide squeeze]]. Criticism was given to the somewhat simplistic [[Pitch (baseball)|pitching]] controls, and the fact that "all batted balls are [[ground ball|grounders]]", but overall the game was described as "blow[ing] away" all other contemporary baseball video games.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Laney |first2= Frank |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= August 1980 |title= Arcade Alley: Armchair Athletes - Sports, Mattel-Style | magazine= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|pages= 12, 92, and 93 |issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|12, 92}} The game is covered in ''Video'' magazine's 1982 Guide to Electronic Games where reviewers noted that the game had "lost none of its luster" since its release.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= November 1982 |title= Video's Guide to Electronic Games | magazine= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 8|pages= 47–56, 108|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|53}} In 1995, ''[[Flux (magazine)|Flux]]'' magazine ranked the game 37th on its Top 100 Video Games.
