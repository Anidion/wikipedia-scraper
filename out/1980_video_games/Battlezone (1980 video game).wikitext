'''''Battlezone''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[Vehicular combat game|tank combat]] game released for [[arcade video game|arcades]] in November 1980 by [[Atari, Inc.]] The player controls a tank which is attacked by other tanks and missiles. Using a small radar scanner along with the terrain window, the player can locate enemies and obstacles around them in the barren landscape. Its innovative use of 3D graphics made it a huge hit, with approximately 15,000 cabinets sold.

With its use of three-dimensional [[vector graphics]], the game is considered to be the first true 3D arcade game with a first-person perspective,{{sfn|Hanson|2021|p=104}} the "first big 3D success" in the [[video game industry]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/the-evolution-of-3d-games-700995 |title=The evolution of 3D games |date=2010-07-11 |website=Tech Radar |access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> and the first successful first-person shooter video game in particular, making it a milestone for first-person shooter games.{{sfn|Hanson|2021|p=104}}

The game was primarily designed by Ed Rotberg, who was mainly inspired by Atari's top-down [[shooter game]] ''[[Tank (video game)|Tank]]'' (1974). ''Battlezone'' was distributed in Japan by [[Sega]] and [[Taito]] in 1981. The system was based on vector hardware designed by Howard Delman which was introduced in ''[[Lunar Lander (1979 video game)|Lunar Lander]]'' and saw success with ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''. The 3D hardware that drove the program saw use in following games, including ''[[Red Baron (1980 video game)|Red Baron]]'', released in 1981.{{sfn|Wolf|2008|p=68}}

==Gameplay==
[[File:Atari-bz-arcade.jpg|thumb|Two joysticks control the player's tank. Instructions on their use are printed on the cabinet.]]

The game uses [[Wire-frame model|wireframe]] [[vector graphics]] displayed on a black and white [[vector monitor]]. A colored overlay tints the display green for the bottom {{frac|4|5}} where the action takes place, and red for the top {{frac|5}} where the score and radar screen are displayed.{{sfn|Hanson|2021|p=104}}

The player drives a tank using two joysticks, one controlling the right tread and the other the left. By moving the joysticks relative to each other, the tank can move forward or reverse (both moved in the same direction), turn on the spot to the left or right (one forward, one back) or move and turn at a slower rate (one forward or backward, one neutral). The right-side stick also has a fire button on top, which fires the player's gun in the direction the tank is currently facing.{{sfn|Hanson|2021|p=104}}

Gameplay takes place on a flat plane with a [[mountain]]ous [[horizon]] featuring an erupting [[volcano]], distant [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]], and various [[Polyhedron|geometric solids]] (in vector outline) like pyramids and blocks. The geometric solid obstacles are indestructible and can block the movement of a player's tank while also blocking shots and can be used as shields. The action surrounds the player in all directions, including off-screen locations, forcing the player to locate the enemy using the radar display at the top of the screen.{{sfn|Hanson|2021|p=104}}

There are three types of enemy craft that appear during play, one at a time. At the start of a game, the enemy is dominated by slow tanks that are not particularly difficult to hit even when moving. As the game continues, missiles begin to appear in place of the enemy tanks; these move much faster and are more difficult to hit. Finally, the much faster supertanks appear at higher levels, which are not only harder to hit but also attack more aggressively.

Periodically saucer-shaped [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s will appear while making a distinctive sound to announce their presence; these do not appear on the radar and do not attack the user, but can be shot for bonus points. This is the only object that may appear while other enemies are already present.

There is a gameplay modification at 100,000 points if the proper conditions are met. When executed properly, the next appearing supertank will not attack but will instead retreat. A tank icon will then appear at right on qualified high score listings.

==Cabinet==
[[File:Musée Mécanique 205.JPG|thumb|upright|''Battlezone'' uses 3D vector graphics viewed  through a "periscope".]]
''Battlezone'' is housed in an upright full-sized [[arcade cabinet]] with a "[[periscope]]" viewfinder. The viewfinder limited the player's view so that the display appeared to be naturally limited to that of the scope.{{sfn|Hanson|2021|p=104}} The game action can also be viewed from the sides of the viewfinder for spectators to watch. The game's periscope viewfinder is similar to earlier [[submarine]] shooting [[arcade games]], notably [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s [[arcade video game]] ''[[Sea Wolf (video game)|Sea Wolf]]'' (1976) and [[Sega]]'s [[electro-mechanical game]] ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]'' (1966).<ref name="Wolf2012">{{cite book |last1=Wolf |first1=Mark J. P. |title=Encyclopedia of Video Games: The Culture, Technology, and Art of Gaming |date=2012 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=978-0-313-37936-9 |volume=1 |pages=68–9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deBFx7QAwsQC&pg=PA68}}</ref> A later version of the cabinet removed the periscope and raised the monitor to a more normal position to improve visibility to non-players and improve ergonomics for players who could not reach the periscope.<ref name= Lendino/> A smaller, "cabaret" version of the cabinet has the screen angled upwards and no periscope.{{sfn|Hanson|2021|p=104}}

The large controller handles were adapted from earlier gear-shift controllers used on racing games, modified with a new stick shape with internal ribs to make them stronger and adding rubber centering bellows. The right stick has a raised and LED illuminated fire button on top, and the controls were completed with a similar LED illuminated start button on the cabinet. There were two speakers, one each above and below the 19-inch monitor.<ref name= Lendino >{{cite book |title= Attract Mode: The Rise and Fall of Coin-Op Arcade Games |first= Jamie |last=Lendino |page=122 |publisher= Steel Gear Press |date=2020}}</ref>

==Development==
With the success of the [[Cinematronics]] [[vector graphics]] games, Atari's [[Cyan Engineering|Grass Valley]] engineering labs decided to build their own version of a vector display system known as "QuadraScan" that offered a resolution of 1024 x 768.{{sfn|Fulton|2008}} Once it was up and running, they delivered the prototype unit to Atari headquarters where it was given to Howard Delman and Rick Moncrief to develop it into a unit suitable for [[arcade video game]] use.{{sfn|Delman|2007}} Delman decided to reimplement the driver system using analog electronics instead of digital, simplifying it and lowering its cost.{{sfn|Fulton|2008}}

While working on the system, Delman suggested they use it to implement a version of ''[[Lunar Lander (1979 video game)|Lunar Lander]]''. While Delman worked on the driver hardware and Moncrief on the display system, Rich Moore wrote the software for the game.{{sfn|Delman|2007}} ''Lunar Lander'' was released in August 1979, Atari's first vector game, but was not a great success with only 4,830 units manufactured.{{sfn|Fulton|2008}}

Another team at Atari consisting of Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Steve Callfee was working on a [[raster graphics]] game called ''Planet Grab''. When they saw ''Lunar Lander'' they asked about using the same system for their game, and the result was ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''. Released in November 1979, it went on to be Atari's most successful game, with 55,000 units sold.{{sfn|Fulton|2008}}

With the system now proving a huge success in the arcades, Morgan Hoff organized a [[brainstorming]] session at Atari to consider additional uses for the hardware. Around the same time, Atari had also been experimenting with early 3D displays using a custom math chip known simply as "the math box", developed by Jed Margolin and Mike Albaugh. The idea of using the math box with the vector hardware seemed like a winner, and the idea of a tank game was raised at the meeting, although Hoff could not remember exactly who introduced the idea.{{sfn|Fulton|2008}}

The game's design was led by Ed Rotberg. He cited Atari's top-down arcade [[shooter game]] ''[[Tank (video game)|Tank]]'' (1974) as the primary inspiration behind ''Battlezone'', essentially a 3D version of that game. While ''Battlezone'' also has similarities to a first-person tank simulation for the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO system]], ''[[Panther (1975 video game)|Panther]]'', Rotberg said he had never played that game before but had heard of it; he said it "may have inspired whoever originally suggested the idea at the brainstorming meeting where it was proposed, but I seriously doubt it".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wolf |first1=Mark J.P. |chapter=''BattleZone'' and the Origins of First-Person Shooting Games |editor-last1=Call |editor-first1=Joshua |editor-last2=Voorhees |editor-first2=Gerald A. |editor-last3=Whitlock |editor-first3=Katie |title=Guns, Grenades, and Grunts: First-Person Shooter Games |date=9 August 2012 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Academic]] |isbn=978-1-4411-4224-5 |pages=25-40 (35-6)}}</ref>

Owen Rubin, who shared an office with Ed Rotberg, came up with the idea of making the volcano in the background erupt, and coded the animation for it.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Steven|last=Kent|title=Retroview: The Owen Rubin Memorial Gameroom |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=35|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1997|page=34}}</ref>

==Ports==
In the 1980s, ''Battlezone'' was ported to the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Commodore 64]], [[VIC-20]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[ZX Spectrum]], and later the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and [[Atari ST]]. The ports to non-Atari systems were from [[Atarisoft]]. The ZX Spectrum version was published by [[Quicksilva]].

The Atari 8-bit version was released on cartridge in 1987 in the styling of the then-new [[Atari XEGS]].<ref name=mania>{{cite web |title=Battlezone |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-battlezone_560.html |website=Atari Mania}}</ref> An [[Atari 5200]] port was scheduled for release in November 1983, but was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reichert |first=Matt |title=Battlezone |website=AtariProtos.com |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/5200/software/battlezone/battlezone.htm |access-date=2007-07-05}}</ref>

The Atari 2600 version uses raster graphics instead of vectors and has a third person view where the tank is visible.

The Atari ST port contains large parts of the original [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] code which is emulated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klapauzius.net/Old_Games.html#Battlezone|title=Spiced up games}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Battlezone'' was released in November 1980 and was a hit. Although not as successful as ''Asteroids'', ''Battlezone'' eventually produced another 15,000 sales for Atari.{{sfn|Fulton|2008}}

''Battlezone'' was well received, earning an Honorable Mention for "Best Commercial Arcade Game" in 1982 at the Third Annual [[Arkie Awards]]. It was runner-up, behind ''[[Pac-Man]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Laney Jr. |first2= Frank |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date = January 1982|title= Arcade Alley: The Third Annual Arcade Awards |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 5|issue= 10|pages= 28, 76–77|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|76}} David and Sandy Small called it "addictive" and mentioned the Battlezone Tunnel Vision, which makes the players drive strangely during rush hour.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Creative Computing |date= January 1982 |page=18 |title=The Expert's Guide to Beating Asteroids, Battlezone, Galazian, RipOff and Space Invaders |first1=David |last1=Small |first2=Sandy |last2=Small |url=https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1982-01/page/n19/mode/2up}}</ref> In a more recent review, Eurogamer stated that "Atari's designers came up with some incredibly inventive and interesting games before their decline.

==''The Bradley Trainer''==
[[Image:Bradley Trainer screenshot.png|thumb|A standard enemy tank in the player's sights in ''The Bradley Trainer''.]]
A version called ''The Bradley Trainer'' (also known as ''Army Battlezone'' or ''Military Battlezone'') was designed for use by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as targeting training for gunners on the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=www.safestuff.com/bradley.htm|url=http://www.safestuff.com/bradley.htm|access-date=2007-09-17}}</ref> It was commissioned by a consultant group of retired generals.<ref name="NGen26">{{cite magazine|title=Army Armed with Quarters!|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=February 1997|page=49}}</ref>

The gunner yoke was based on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle control and was later re-used in the popular ''[[Star Wars (1983 video game)|Star Wars]]'' game.<ref name="stevenkent" /> ''The Bradley Trainer'' differs dramatically from the original ''Battlezone'' as it features helicopters, missiles, and machine guns; furthermore, the actual tank does not move but the guns simply rotate.

==Legacy==
Because of its use of [[first person (video games)|first-person]] pseudo [[3D graphics]] combined with a "viewing goggle" that the player puts his or her face into, ''Battlezone'' is sometimes considered the first [[virtual reality]] arcade video game.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=British Film Institute|title=The New Media Book|author=Dan Harries|year=2002}}</ref>
