'''''Video Pinball''''' is a [[video game]] programmed by Bob Smith and released by [[Atari, Inc.]] in 1980 for the Atari VCS (renamed to the Atari 2600 in 1982). The Sears rebranded version for its Tele-Games system is '''''Arcade Pinball'''''.

==Gameplay==

''Video Pinball'' is a loose simulation of an arcade [[pinball]] machine: ball launcher, flippers, bumpers, and spinners. Hitting the Atari logo on the playfield four times awards an extra ball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=588 |title=Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Video Pinball (Atari) |publisher=[[Atari Age]] |access-date=2013-10-05}}</ref>

Pulling down on the [[Atari CX40 joystick|Atari joystick]] pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. The ball can be nudged (as in nudging a table gently in real life) by holding down the joystick button and moving the controller in a particular direction. Nudging too much results in a tilt, forcing the ball to drain.

==Development==
Bob Smith applied to work for [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] at the end of the 1970s and was hired on the spot. Smith shared an office Brad Stewart who had worked on the Atari 2600 version of ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''. After a week in the office, Smith was offered a list of possible games to work on from his boss Dennis Koble and opted to work on ''Video Pinball''. While he did play the original ''Video Pinball'' arcade game in Atari headquarters, he played the ''Superman'' pinball game by Atari for inspiration.{{sfn|Drury|2017|p=93}}
