== Plot ==

''Time Traveler'' is a game in which the player goes back in time to 14 different eras to collect a hidden ring from each era, each one having a different special ability to help the player. The player then brings the rings back to the time machine laboratory.<ref name="Dragon44"/>

== Reception ==

The game was reviewed in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'' #44 by Mark Herro. Herro said that his opinion of the game kept changing as he played it; he intended to evaluate the game negatively at first, but the more he played the more he found himself liking it despite its problems. As he was playing an early pre-production advance copy, he found a number of little bugs in the program. Krell Software told him they had taken care of the problems in later versions.<ref name="Dragon44">{{cite journal|title   = The Electric Eye|author  = Herro, Mark|journal = The Dragon|issue   = 44|date    = December 1980|pages   = 86–87}}</ref>

Jon Mishcon reviewed ''Time Traveler'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 39.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Mishcon |first=Jon |date=May 1981 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=39|pages=36}}</ref> Mishcon commented that "Overall I'd say this game has some great ideals but fails to give the player enough information so that you can just sit down and enjoy playing. Those who delight in delving into a long game may find this enjoyable. I'd recommend you wait for their next game."<ref name="SG"/>

Terry Romine reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "I fear that, after a person develops a strategy, the game will quickly become a series of stale replays. There are no differences between eras other than the name of the era and its political factions."<ref name="CGW1">{{cite magazine |last=Romine |first=Terry |title=Micro - Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=November–December 1981 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=32}}</ref>
