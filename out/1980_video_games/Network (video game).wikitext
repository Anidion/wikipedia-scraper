'''''Network''''' is a real-time, [[two player]] [[business simulation game]] developed by [[David Mullich]] for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and published by [[Edu-Ware]] in 1980.

==Gameplay==
Two players play competitively against the computer, each taking the role of the programming chief for a major [[television network]].  Each side bids on new television shows to add to the season's line-up, schedules them, monitors the weekly ratings, and then drops shows with poor ratings or reschedules them to recover from mistakes at the end of the thirteen-week season.  The side with the highest ratings is the winner.

==Reception==
[[Bruce Webster]] reviewed ''Network'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 31.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=Bruce |author-link=Bruce Webster |date=September 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=31|pages=28}}</ref> Webster commented that "Unfortunately, I just could not get interested in the game. It moves slowly and requires (for intelligent play) that the players keep track of a lot of information that is not always easily accessible. One friend I played against quit out of boredom at one point, and I found myself yawning. There is a lack of tension, which means that personal interest must be the overriding factor in playing the game - and I'm just not that interested in network planning. If you are, then this is the game for you; otherwise, I'm afraid you'll just be disappointed."<ref name="SG"/>
