{{nihongo foot|'''''Sasuke vs. Commander'''''|サスケＶＳコマンダー|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[1980 in video games|1980]] [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade video game]] developed and released by Shin Nihon Kikaku (today's [[SNK]]) in [[Japan]].

The game is a [[fixed shooter]] in the which player at the bottom shoots upward at enemies traveling and shooting down the screen. In contrast to the outer-space theme of most such games of the era, ''Sasuke vs. Commander'' is set in a magical world with ninja-like enemies and alternative waves of simple attackers and more powerful [[Boss (video games)|bosses]].

''Sasuke vs. Commander'' was popular in Japan; according to ''Game Machine'', it was in 10th place overall in 1981 grosses, tied with the older, but still popular, ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Missile Command]]''. It is historically notable as among the earliest examples of recurring boss fights.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Sasuke, a [[ninja]] dressed in blue who moves back and forth across the bottom of the vertically oriented screen.

The game alternates between two types of levels. The first type of level takes place on a background showing a road leading to a castle seen in the background. A number of ninjas dressed in red or green appear in a puff of smoke and then attack with various weapons while moving down the screen. Sasuke is killed if he touches either, and loses one of his three lives. He returns fire with [[shuriken]]s, and if he hits an enemy it turns purple and falls directly down the screen, presenting another way to be killed.

When the first type of wave is completed, or Sasuke is killed, the second type of wave begins, the "magic bonus". These start with a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] appearing out of the castle while a fanfare plays, at the end of which the action moves to a new background scene showing a mountain landscape. On these waves, the bosses remain near the top of the screen and use more powerful weapons. These levels are timed, and the player receives a bonus if he kills the bosses based on how much time is left. If he is killed on these levels he receives no bonus but does not lose a life.

The game ends if Sasuke loses all of his lives, or completes all eight levels. If he successfully reaches the end, a [[cutscene]] shows Sasuke tripping over a rock and not getting up.

==Reception==
Although a few English language materials refer to the game, Japanese arcade trade newspaper ''Game Machine'' lists it as being the 10th most popular arcade game in 1981 based on income, tied with ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Missile Command]]''.{{sfn|GameMachine|1981|p=2}}

It has since become better known as one of SNK's earliest releases,{{sfn|Museum}} as well as one of the first arcade games to include multiple boss fights,{{sfn|Moyse|2020}} along with [[Phoenix (1980 video game)|''Phoenix'']] and Cidelsa's ''Destroyer'' of the same year.{{sfn|Greenbaum|2022}}

==Legacy==
''Sasuke vs. Commander'' was available as one of 24 titles to be included in ''[[SNK 40th Anniversary Collection]]'', first released for the [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2018, followed by the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2019.

On February 13, 2020, the game has since been re-released for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo Switch]], through the [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Nintendo eShop]] respectively as part of the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' series, courtesy of [[Hamster Corporation]].{{sfn|Moyse|2020}}
