==Reception==
David Long reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', stating that: "''Computer Ambush'' (Second Edition) has been well worth the wait! It's fast, smooth flowing, and surprisingly realistic. This game could set the standard for tactical simulations for a long time to come. At least, until the Third Edition comes out."<ref name="CGW10">{{cite magazine |last=Long |first=David |title=Computer Ambush: Review & Analysis |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=May–Jun 1983 |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=10–11, 44}}</ref>
