{{nihongo foot|'''''Tank Battalion'''''|タンクバタリアン|Tanku Batarian|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[Shoot 'em up#Multidirectional shooter|multi-directional shooter]] [[arcade video game]] that was released by [[Namco]] in 1980. The only direct home conversion is for the [[MSX]], although it was followed up by two sequels: ''[[Battle City]]'' for the [[Family Computer|Famicom]] in 1985 and ''[[Tank Force]]'' for arcades in 1991.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Tankbatt.png|thumb|left|The player destroying an enemy tank.]]
The player, controlling a [[tank]], must destroy twenty enemy tanks in each round, which enter the playfield from the top of the screen. The enemy tanks attempt to destroy the player's base (represented on the map as an [[eagle]]) as well as the player tank itself. A round is cleared when the player destroys all twenty enemy tanks, but the game ends if the player's base is destroyed or they run out of lives.

==Reception==
''[[Cash Box (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' believed that "the real excitement" of ''Tank Battalion'' lied within its ability to modify the level design by destroying the brick walls.<ref name="Cashbox">{{cite magazine |title=Game Plan Bows 'Tank Battalion', Its Latest Upright Model Video Game |date=April 11, 1981 |magazine=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] |page=42 |issn=0008-7289 |url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox42unse_45/page/36/mode/2up?q=Namco+Tank+Battalion}}</ref>

Retrospectively in 2015, a writer for ''Beep!'' enjoyed the Sord M5 version for its improvements over the arcade original, such as the smoother movement of the player's tank, but disliked the squashed-looking graphics and narrow playing space. While the writer believed the MSX version was superior, they still recommended the M5 version for Namco fans and collectors.<ref>{{cite web |title=No.2 タンクバタリアン（m5）ROMカセット |url=https://www.beep-shop.com/column_entry/16963/ |website=Beep! |accessdate=October 1, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227215316/https://www.beep-shop.com/column_entry/16963/ |archivedate=February 27, 2020 |language=ja |date=June 1, 2015}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
A theme based on the game for ''[[Pac-Man 99]]'' was released as free post-launch DLC, featuring visuals and sounds from the game.{{Citation needed|date=November 2022}}
