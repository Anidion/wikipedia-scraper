'''''Crazy Balloon''''' is a [[maze video game]] released in arcades by [[Taito]] in 1980.<ref name="klov">[http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7424 Crazy Balloon] at Killer List of Videogames</ref> ''Crazy Balloon'' requires the player to maneuver a [[balloon]] through a maze of thorns to reach the goal.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a [[box]] tied to a floating [[balloon]], which swings left and right continually, within a [[maze]] filled with [[Nail (fastener)|spikes]]. Any contact with the spikes, either with the balloon or the box, destroys the balloon. Using a four-way [[joystick]], the player moves the box through the maze and toward the goal, ensuring that the swinging balloon avoids the spikes.

The player collects points as the box moves closer to the goal (backtracking earns no points). Certain areas of the maze are colored green and purple, and the player will earn more points if the balloon and box pass through the area safely. While there is no time limit, the player cannot wait for a long time; otherwise, a face will appear and blow the balloon into the spikes.

As the player completes mazes, individual spikes, or even the entire maze, may begin moving or scrolling.

==Music==
''Crazy Balloon'' sports relatively basic sound effects. The speaker beeps whenever the balloon gets closer to the goal. When the player starts a new maze, a portion of the melody from "[[Oh! Susanna]]" is played. Similarly, when the player loses a balloon, a portion of the chorus from the "[[Toreador Song]]" from the opera ''[[Carmen]]'' is played.

==Legacy==
The original arcade version is included in emulated compilations such as ''[[Taito Legends 2]]'' ([[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]) and ''[[Taito Legends Power-Up]]'' ([[PlayStation Portable]]) in 2006. An updated version of the game, named ''Crazy Balloon 2005'', was included alongside the original arcade release on ''Taito Legends Power-Up''.

There were no official contemporary home ports, but there were clones, including ''Crazy Balloon'' for the [[Commodore 64]] ([[Software Projects]], 1983)<ref name="c64">[http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=553 Crazy Balloon] at Lemon 64</ref> and ''Crazy Balloons'' for the [[ZX Spectrum]] (A&F Software, 1983).<ref name="spectrum">[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001118 Crazy Balloons] at World of Spectrum</ref> A version for the [[BBC Micro]] was developed by [[Acornsoft]] but was never released.<ref name="acornsoft">[http://www.stairwaytohell.com/lostandfound/homepage.html Lost and found] at Stairway to Hell</ref>
