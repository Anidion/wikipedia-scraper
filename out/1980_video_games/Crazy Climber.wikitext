{{nihongo|'''''Crazy Climber'''''|クレイジークライマー|Kureijī Kuraimā}} is a [[vertically scrolling video game]] produced by Nichibutsu ([[Nihon Bussan]]) and released for arcades in 1980. In North America, the game was also released by [[Taito|Taito America]]. Ports for the [[Arcadia 2001]] and [[Atari 2600]] were published in 1982, followed by the [[Famicom]] in 1986 and [[X68000]] in 1993.

With the goal of scaling a series of [[skyscraper]]s using two joysticks (one controlling the left side of the character's body, the other the right) ''Crazy Climber'' was the first in a "climbing games" genre which includes [[Nintendo]]'s 1981 ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref name=climbing/> The genre eventually became better known as [[platform games]] and is defined by jumping and traversal between platforms, neither of which are found in ''Crazy Climber''.

''Crazy Climber'' was the third highest-earning [[1980 in video games|arcade game of 1980]] in Japan while also being a commercial success in North America. A lesser-known sequel, ''Crazy Climber 2'', was released for arcades in 1988.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Crazy Climber'' was the third highest-grossing [[1980 in video games|arcade game of 1980]], just below ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Galaxian]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=ベストスリー 本紙調査 (調査対象1980年) 〜 アーケードゲーム機|trans-title=Best Three Book Survey (Survey Target 1980) ~ Arcade Game Machines|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=159|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 February 1981|page=2|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19810215p.pdf#page=2}}</ref> ''Crazy Climber'' was also Japan's eighth highest-grossing [[1981 in video games|arcade game of 1981]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title="Donkey Kong" No.1 Of '81 — ''Game Machine's Survey Of "The Year's Best Three AM Machines"'' —|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=182|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 February 1982|page=30|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19820215p.pdf#page=16}}</ref>

In North America, ''Crazy Climber'' was among the top ten highest-earning arcade games in the summer [[1982 in video games|of 1982]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Daniel |title=Video Games |date=1982 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |location=New York |isbn=0-671-45872-8 |page=38 |url=https://archive.org/details/book_video_games/page/n44}}</ref>

==Legacy==
* In 1981, [[Bandai]] Electronics manufactured a [[Handheld electronic game|hand-held]] [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] version of the game.
* A 3D Board Game was released by Bandai in 1981, exclusively in Japan.
* ''[[Spider-Man (1982 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' (1982) for the Atari 2600 was similar to ''Crazy Cimber'', a variation on its gameplay format with added web shooting and swinging abilities.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Trost |first1=Mark |title=Spiderman |magazine=[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]] |date=February 1983 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=58–9 |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_04_1983-02_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/page/n57/mode/2up}}</ref>
* A 1985 sequel titled ''Crazy Climber '85'' was produced, but put into storage by Nichibutsu in favor of ''[[Terra Cresta]]''. This unreleased sequel was eventually included in on the PlayStation version of ''Nichibutsu Arcade Classics''.
* A Japanese-only sequel, ''[[Crazy Climber 2]]'', was produced in 1988. The game was essentially identical to ''Crazy Climber'' in gameplay but featured more sophisticated graphics and a few new features.
* On February 3, 1996, ''Hyper Crazy Climber'' was released only in Japan for the [[PlayStation]]. It has similar gameplay to that of the original game but also a few differences. Players can choose between three cartooney characters, each with their own strength/speed attributes. Several buildings can be selected from a [[Bomberman (series)|''Bomberman'']]-style map screen, including an underwater building, a medieval clock tower, a haunted skyscraper, and a beanstalk. Power-ups are also used. It was also released for Windows on November 30 the same year.
* On March 2, 2000, ''Crazy Climber 2000'' was released for the [[PlayStation]]. This is more of a remake of the original arcade game using 3D graphics for the first time. A notable feature is the ability to turn corners and access different sides of the buildings, which now have a variety of designs (including one with a cylindrical, tower-like shape). The game included the original port of the arcade ''Crazy Climber'' and a scan of the instruction panel. Like ''Hyper Crazy Climber'' which released for the same console 4 years earlier, ''Crazy Climber 2000'' was released only in Japan.
* Japanese publisher [[Hamster Corporation|HAMSTER]] released the arcade version of ''Crazy Climber'' under their ''[[Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono]] (オレたちゲーセン族)'' classic game line for the [[PlayStation 2]] on July 21, 2005.
* ''Crazy Climber Wii'' was released for the [[Wii]] in Japan on December 20, 2007.<ref>[http://au.wii.ign.com/objects/142/14212437.html IGN: Crazy Climber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004956/http://au.wii.ign.com/objects/142/14212437.html |date=2011-07-13}}</ref>
* The arcade game was released on the [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on February 23, 2010.
