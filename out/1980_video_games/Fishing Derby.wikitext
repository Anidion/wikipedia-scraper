'''''Fishing Derby''''' is a [[fishing video game]] written by [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]] for the Atari Video Computer System (renamed to the [[Atari 2600]] in 1982) and published by [[Activision]] in 1980.<ref name="giantlist"/> It's one of the first video games developed by Activision.

==Gameplay==

In ''Fishing Derby'', two [[fishermen]] sit on opposite docks over a lake filled with fish (and a shark that passes through). Using the [[joystick]] the player is able to move the fishing line left, right, up, and down in the water. When a fish is hooked, the line slowly comes up to the surface of the water. Pressing the fire button on the joystick reels in the fish faster. However, if both fishermen have hooked fish, only one person can reel it in (the one who first hooked the fish). The shark that roams the water will try to eat hooked fish before they surface.

The objective for both fishermen is to reach 99 pounds of fish first. There are six rows of fish; the top two rows have 2&nbsp;lb. fish, the middle two rows have 4&nbsp;lb. fish and the two bottom rows have 6&nbsp;lb. fish. The more valuable fish sit at the bottom, but they are harder to bring in as they run a higher risk of being eaten by the shark.

The game's two variants are simply single-player and multi-player.  In both games the objective is to reach 99&nbsp;lb. of fish first.

==Reception==
In ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine's "Arcade Alley" column, ''Fishing Derby'' was characterized as "imaginative, colorful, and fun" providing children with "better animation than [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning TV]] and provid[ing] adults with a subtle game of skill". Overall the reviewers recommended it as a family game.<ref name=kunkel>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Laney |first2= Frank |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= December 1980 |title= Arcade Alley: A New Era Begins - Activision Exploits Atari's Success |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|pages= 12 and 105 |issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|105}}
