==Gameplay==

The game can be played single or with two players. The goal is to reach the finish line in the shortest time possible. A countdown of few seconds introduces a round, during which the player may not shift gears or get disqualified for the round. At start, the player needs to accelerate and shift up to four gears.<ref>{{cite web |last1=admin@retrogames.cz |first1=Morfeus |title=Dragster (Atari 2600) - online game |url=https://www.retrogames.cz/play_862-Atari2600.php |website=RetroGames.cz |access-date=20 October 2021}}</ref>

==Development==
''Dragster'' was developed by [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]]. Crane developed a new way to display score for the Atari 2600 which is normally set to the left and right of the screen, which Crane described as "very blocky".<ref name="ActPack2" /> Activision developed a new way to display the score high-resolution six-digit score display that converted it into graphics that could slide across the screen. Crane stated he designed the game that would hold interest for hours despite the fact that each game would be about six seconds long.<ref name="ActPack2" />

''Dragster'' was Activision's first title for the Atari 2600.<ref name="ActPack2" />

''Dragster'' was reviewed by ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine in its "Arcade Alley" column where it was described as having "an interesting premise" and as being "undeniably clever and, with a lot of patience, ... probably fun" but the reviewers also called it the "least" of Activision's early Atari 2600 releases. Specific criticism was given to the "clumsy" and "annoying" gameplay mechanics, and the game design was characterized as "ill-suited to the Atari control system".<ref name=kunkel>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Laney |first2= Frank |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= December 1980 |title= Arcade Alley: A New Era Begins - Activision Exploits Atari's Success |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|pages= 12 and 105 |issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|105}}

==World record and controversy==
In 1982, [[Todd Rogers (gamer)|Todd Rogers]] claimed the world record with a time of 5.51 seconds. Until January 29, 2018, this was accepted by [[Twin Galaxies]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/scores.php?scores=2390|title=Scores of NTSC - Game 1, Difficulty B [Fastest Time] - Dragster|publisher=Twin Galaxies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821124944/http://www.twingalaxies.com/scores.php?scores=2390|archive-date=2017-08-21}}</ref> and [[Guinness World Records]], which later recognized it as the longest-standing video game record. Rogers said he achieved his time by shifting into second gear as the countdown timer reached zero.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atariage.com/forums/topic/16980-dragster-by-activision-certs/|title=Guinness Officially Nixes Todd Rogers' Dragster Records|date=28 November 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201024151/http://atariage.com/forums/topic/16980-dragster-by-activision-certs/|archive-date=2018-02-01|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> Eric "Omnigamer" Koziel, a speedrunner and creator of [[tool-assisted speedrun]]s, analyzed the [[source code]] of the game, and it was discovered that 5.51 seconds was impossible. He did not find it possible to shift during the countdown and determined the best possible time to be 5.57.

On January 29, 2018, Twin Galaxies removed Todd Rogers' records and banned him from participating in their competitive leaderboards.<ref>{{cite web|title=DISPUTE: DICK MORELAND - ATARI 2600 / VCS - DRAGSTER - NTSC - GAME 1, DIFFICULTY B [FASTEST TIME] - PLAYER: TODD ROGERS - SCORE: 05.51|url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/showthread.php/175364-Dispute-Dick-Moreland-Atari-2600-VCS-Dragster-NTSC-Game-1-Difficulty-B-Fastest-Time-Player-Todd-Rogers-Score-05-51?p=945911&viewfull=1#post945911|publisher=Twin Galaxies}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/01/29/a-man-accused-of-cheating-at-video-games-may-lose-his-decades-old-guinness-world-record/|title=A man accused of cheating at video games may lose his decades-old Guinness World Record|last=Wang|first=Amy B.|date=2018-01-29|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Guinness World Records also removed him from its database.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/01/guinness-officially-nixes-todd-rogers-dragster-records/|title=Guinness Officially Nixes Todd Rogers' Dragster Records|date=2018-01-31|work=Kotaku Australia|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/guinness-officially-nixes-todd-rogers-dragster-records-1822568394|title=Guinness Officially Nixes Todd Rogers' Dragster Records|publisher=Kotaku|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202071519/https://kotaku.com/guinness-officially-nixes-todd-rogers-dragster-records-1822568394|archive-date=2018-02-02|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref>
