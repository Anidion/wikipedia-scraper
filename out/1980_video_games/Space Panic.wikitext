{{nihongo|'''''Space Panic'''''|スぺース・パ二ック|Supesu Panikku}} is a 1980 [[arcade video game]] developed by [[Universal Entertainment|Universal]]. Predating Nintendo's ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and lacking a jump mechanic, ''Space Panic'' was the first game involving climbing ladders between walkable platforms. The genre was initially labeled "climbing games", but later became known as [[platform game]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bloom |first1=Steve |title=Video Invaders |date=1982 |publisher=Arco Publishing |isbn=978-0668055208 |page=[https://archive.org/details/book_video_invaders/page/n49 29] |url=https://archive.org/details/book_video_invaders}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=[[Chris Crawford on Game Design]] |isbn=0-88134-117-7 |last=Crawford |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Crawford (game designer) |year=2003 |publisher=New Riders}}</ref> A [[ColecoVision]] port by [[CBS Electronics]] was released in the winter holiday season of 1982.<ref name="Thomasson"/>

The original arcade game was commercially successful in Japan. It was an obscure release in North America, but a clone, ''[[Apple Panic]]'', became a top-seller for [[home computer]]s. ''[[Lode Runner]]'' (1983) later put its own spin on climbing and digging, a lineage which eventually took on the name [[puzzle-platform game]]s.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:ARC Space Panic.png|thumb|left|The player hits a trapped alien with a shovel. Two aliens roam free.]]

The main character can move along platforms and climb the ladders between them. The goal is to dig holes in the platforms and lure [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s into them. Hitting a trapped alien with the shovel knocks them out of the hole and off the screen. In later [[Level (video gaming)|levels]], two or more holes must be lined up vertically in order to dispose of stronger aliens.

There is a limited supply of [[oxygen]], which acts as a [[timer]].

==Development==
The game's development team included Kazutoshi Ueda, who later went on to design ''[[Lady Bug (video game)|Lady Bug]]'' (1981) and ''[[Mr. Do!]]'' (1982) at Universal and then ''[[Bomb Jack]]'' (1984) and ''[[Tehkan World Cup]]'' (1985) at [[Tehkan]] (later known as Tecmo).<ref name="Gamest">{{cite magazine |title=Talking Game Design with Fukio "MTJ" Mitsuji |magazine=[[Gamest]] |date=1989 |lang=ja |url=http://shmuplations.com/mtjdesign/}}</ref>

The game's concept was inspired by ''[[Heiankyo Alien]]'' (1979), also known as ''Digger'', a top-down [[maze game]] with digging and trapping mechanics. ''Space Panic'' changed it to a side-view gameplay format, while adding platforms and ladders.<ref name="Thomasson">{{cite magazine |last1=Thomasson |first1=Michael |title=Space Panic: The Foundation of All Platformers |magazine=Old School Gamer Magazine |date=July 2019 |issue=11 |pages=12–3 |url=https://archive.org/details/old-school-gamer-011/page/n11/mode/2up}}</ref><ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Heiankyo Alien |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/heiankyo-alien/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=July 17, 2014 |access-date=20 April 2021}}</ref>

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Space Panic'' was commercially successful. It was tied with ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' and ''[[Jump Bug]]'' as the 14th highest-grossing [[1981 in video games|arcade video game of 1981]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title="Donkey Kong" No.1 Of '81 — ''Game Machine's Survey Of "The Year's Best Three AM Machines"'' —|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=182|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 February 1982|page=30|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19820215p.pdf#page=16}}</ref> In North America, ''Space Panic'' was commercially unsuccessful, which ''[[Electronic Games]]'' in 1983 attributed to its concepts' novelty to the audience: "not only the first of the climbing games, it was also the first of the digging games. That's quite a load for a player on a new game. No punning intended when I say that the rungs were too high for the average gamer to scale." The magazine reported that the average play time was 30 seconds.<ref name="pearl198306">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_16_1983-06_Reese_Communications_US/page/n81 | title=Closet Classics | magazine=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | last=Pearl | first=Rick | volume=1 | issue=16 | pages=82–6}}</ref>

In a retrospective review of the ColecoVision version for ''Digital Press Online'', Kevin Oleniacz concluded, "Coleco had resurrected several short-lived arcade games and transformed them into home favorites, but they should have let ''Space Panic'' rest in peace."<ref name="dpo">{{cite web|last1=Oleniacz|first1=Kevin|title=Space Panic|url=http://www.digitpress.com/reviews/spacepanic.htm|website=Digital Press Online|date=December 2003}}</ref>

==Legacy==
While the original arcade game was unsuccessful in North America, the concept found popularity in the unauthorized home computer version, ''[[Apple Panic]]'' (1981), which was more successful than the original game in North America.<ref name="pearl198306"/> It also inspired ''[[Lode Runner]]'' (1983),<ref name="Retro">{{cite magazine |last1=Grannell |first1=Craig |title=Lode Runner |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |date=January 2013 |issue=111 |pages=20–7 |url=https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____111}}</ref> which has a similar look and also uses the basic premise of digging holes to trap enemies.

Universal revisited the genre with ''[[Mr. Do's Castle]]'' (1983), which expanded upon the play styles explored in ''Space Panic''.

Video game historian Michael Thomasson, writing for ''Old School Gamer Magazine'', considers ''Space Panic'' to be the "foundation of all platformers" despite being "a rather obscure" cult classic, stating that it "revolutionized game design by introducing novel game mechanics and birthed a new genre."<ref name="Thomasson"/> It was also one of the earliest "digging" type games (after ''Heiankyo Alien''), which are variously called "trap 'em up" or "digging games".<ref name="HG101"/><ref name="pearl198306"/>

''[[Horace and the Spiders]]'' (1983) includes a ''Space Panic'' inspired level.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fox |first1=Matt |title=The Video Games Guide: 1,000+ Arcade, Console and Computer Games, 1962-2012, 2d ed. |date=3 January 2013 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-0-7864-7257-4 |page=268 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzMYYrsDaAEC&pg=PA268}}</ref>
