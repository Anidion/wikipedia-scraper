Smith for the [[TRS-80]] and published in 1980 by [[Microsoft]].<ref name="giantlist"/> In the game, the player competes in ten track and field events. The gold medalist for decathlon in the [[Montreal]] [[1976 Summer Olympics]], [[Caitlyn Jenner]] (then known as ''Bruce Jenner'')<!-- Please see [[MOS:DEADNAME]]. -->, is a character. It was ported to the [[Apple II]] in 1981. The 1982 version for the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] was renamed '''''Microsoft Decathlon'''''.

==Reception==
''Decathlon'' received the ''Creative Computing'' Game of the Year Award at the 1980 [[West Coast Computer Faire]].{{r|kater198112}} ''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' in 1981 called ''Decathlon'' "a great party game"<ref name="wiliams198112">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-12/1981_12_BYTE_06-12_Computer_Games#page/n7/mode/2up | title=New Games New Directions | work=BYTE | date=December 1981 | accessdate=19 October 2016 | author=Williams, Gregg | pages=6–10}}</ref> and "a remarkable simulation ... challenging and entertaining", praising the adherence to the real decathlon's rules and the TRS-80 and Apple II versions' graphics.<ref name="kater198112">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-12/1981_12_BYTE_06-12_Computer_Games#page/n75/mode/2up | title=Olympic Decathlon | work=BYTE | date=December 1981 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Kater, David A | pages=74}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in 1982 that ''Decathlon'' "has all the characteristics that are required of a long-lasting, quality game". It described the game as having "superb graphics and sound", and concluded that "it is an important contribution to the computer gaming hobby".<ref name="sipe19820506">{{cite magazine | title=Olympic Decathlon: A Classic Computer Game | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=May–June 1982 | author=Sipe, Russell | pages=32–33}}</ref>

Former decathlete Douglas Cobb wrote in ''[[PC Magazine]]'' in 1983 that "this impressive, realistic game brings back vivid memories and provides exciting entertainment through all ten events. The jumping and throwing events are particularly authentic, applying theories used in actual competition. Strategies combining speed, timing, and direction are authentic enough to help an Olympic hopeful train on the basic principles behind the individual events".<ref name="cobb198312">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vy3cBZkjbZgC&pg=RA2-PA139 | title=Running, Reptiles, and 'Rithmetic | work=PC Magazine | date=December 1983 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Cobb, Douglas | pages=139}}</ref> In 1984 ''[[InfoWorld]]'' wrote that "no one's topped it yet.

==Legacy==
''Olympic Decathlon'' was one of first sports-related programs to mix game and simulation elements, with its Olympic track-and-field gameplay preceding [[Konami]]'s ''[[Track & Field (video game)|Track & Field]]'' (1983) by several years,<ref name="reed"/> as well as ''[[The Activision Decathlon]]'' (1983).
