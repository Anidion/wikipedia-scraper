==Reception==
Forrest Johnson reviewed ''The Warp Factor'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 39.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Johnson |first=Forrest |date=May 1981 |title=Featured Review: The Warp Factor|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=39|pages=8}}</ref> Johnson commented that "''The Warp Factor'' is a challenging game. Our machine was kept pretty busy by staffers who wanted to know, for example, how [[Captain Kirk]] would do against a swarm of [[Tie-fighter]]s. It is slow, but it can keep your attention. And it is a good buy for the Star Fleet Battles addict who can't find an opponent."<ref name="SG"/>
