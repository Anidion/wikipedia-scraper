==Gameplay==
[[File:Video Checkers Atari 2600.jpg|thumb|left|A game is in progress.]]
The game is based on the traditional game of [[checkers]], called draughts outside North America. It has 19 variations of play.<ref name="TV Gamer" />

==Development==
The game was developed by [[Carol Shaw]] at Atari. She was one of Atari's earliest female programmers, and ''Video Checkers'' and ''3D Tic-Tac-Toe'' are two of the first commercially-released video games written by a woman.<ref name="Crowhurst">{{cite web|last1=Crowhurst|first1=Anna-Marie|date=July 24, 2018|title=This female gaming pioneer was so successful she retired at 35|url=https://www.stylist.co.uk/visible-women/forgotten-women-carol-shaw-gaming-tech-career-advice-retire/219250|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826114815/https://www.stylist.co.uk/visible-women/forgotten-women-carol-shaw-gaming-tech-career-advice-retire/219250|archive-date=August 26, 2019|access-date=February 28, 2021|work=[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]}}</ref> She accepted the project because [[Bob Whitehead]] was working on ''[[Video Chess]]'' at the time. Working with 4 [[kilobyte]]s of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] and the system's 128 [[byte]]s of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], her algorithm uses [[alpha–beta pruning]]. This is more sophisticated than the algorithm developed at the same time by [[Activision]] co-founder Alan Miller for his version of ''Checkers'', which uses 2 kilobytes of ROM. Miller later called Shaw to offer her a job at Activision, impressed with her work on ''Video Checkers''.<ref>{{Cite interview|last=Shaw|first=Carol|interviewer=Benj Edwards|title=VC&G Interview: Carol Shaw, Atari’s First Female Video Game Developer|url=https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/800|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108093448/https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/800|archive-date=January 8, 2021|date=October 12, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Reception==
Writing in ''The Player's Strategy Guide to Atari VCS Home Video Games'' in 1982, ''[[Electronic Games]]'' editors Arnie Katz and [[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]] called the game "moderately challenging", remarking that the [[Artificial intelligence in video games|computer player]] "is usually capable of matching the skill level of just about any player".<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Arnie|url=https://archive.org/details/book_players_strategy_guide/page/n27/mode/2up?view=theater|title=The Player's Strategy Guide to Atari VCS Home Video Games|last2=Kunkel|first2=Bill|author-link2=Bill Kunkel (journalist)|publisher=Dell Publishing, Reese Publishing|year=1982|isbn=0-440-17058-3|location=New York|page=54}}</ref> In a June 1983 review of ''Video Checkers'', the game was described as "rather limited in its interest [...] unless you are an addict of the game".<ref name="TV Gamer">{{cite magazine|date=June 1983|title=Video Checkers|url=https://archive.org/details/TV_Gamer_1983-06_Boytonbrook_GB/page/n37/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=TV Gamer|page=38|access-date=February 28, 2021}}</ref> In the 1984 German book, ''Das grosse Handbuch der Video Spiele'', Harmut Huff gave the game a middling score.<ref name="Huff">{{cite book|last1=Huff|first1=Harmut|url=https://archive.org/details/Huff.1984.Heyne.Das.grosse.Handbuch.der.Video.Spiele/page/n79/mode/2up?q=%22video+checkers%22|title=Das grosse Handbuch der Video Spiele|date=1984|publisher=Wilhelm Heyne Verlag|isbn=3453416201|page=77|language=German|access-date=February 28, 2021}}</ref>

In the 2011 book ''Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984 A Complete Reference Guide'', Brett Weiss praised the computer player, saying it did "a reasonably good job", but criticized the way the screen blanks while planning its turn.<ref name="Weiss" /> In the 2018 book ''The A-Z of Atari 2600 Games: Volume 2'', Kieren Hawken gave a negative review, criticizing the "sluggish" controls, the slow speed at which the computer takes its turns, and the basic graphics, giving the game a score of 3/10 overall.<ref name="Hawken">{{cite book |last1=Hawken |first1=Kieren |title=The A-Z of Atari 2600 Games: Volume 2 |date=2017 |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |isbn=9781785387630 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JE3DwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Video+Checkers%22+%22atari%22&pg=PT94 |access-date=February 28, 2021}}</ref>
