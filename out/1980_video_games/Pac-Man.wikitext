{{nihongo foot|'''''Pac-Man''''',|パックマン|Pakkuman|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} originally called '''''Puck Man''''' in Japan, is a 1980 [[maze video game]] developed and released by [[Namco]] for [[Arcade video game|arcades]]. In North America, the game was released by [[Midway Manufacturing]] as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.

Game development began in early 1979, directed by [[Toru Iwatani]] with a nine-man team. Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time had themes of war or sports.{{sfn|Lammers|1986|page=265}}<ref name="pac-man-at-40">{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/pac-man-40-anniversary-history/index.html |title=Pac-Man at 40: The eating icon that changed gaming history|last=Prisco|first=Jacopo|date=2020-05-21|website=cnn.com|publisher=[[CNN]]|access-date=2023-01-23}}</ref> Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said he rounded out the Japanese character for mouth, '''kuchi''' ({{lang-ja|[[wikt:口|口]]}}). The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of ''Puck Man'' was derived from the Japanese phrase ''paku paku taberu'', which refers to gobbling something up; the title was changed to ''Pac-Man'' for the North American release.

''Pac-Man'' was a widespread critical and commercial success, leading to several sequels, merchandise, and two television series, as well as a hit single, "[[Pac-Man Fever (song)|Pac-Man Fever]]", by [[Buckner & Garcia]]. The character of Pac-Man has become the official mascot of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-10-16 |title=Pacman: The Phenomenon - Part 1 - Classic Gaming |url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&id=249 |access-date=2023-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016203822/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&id=249 |archive-date=October 16, 2007 }}</ref> The game remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling games, generating more than $14&nbsp;billion in revenue ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) and 43&nbsp;million units in sales combined, and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy, commonly listed as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Pac-man.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot. The ghosts are in the center with Pac-Man below them. At bottom left is the player's life count, and at bottom right the level icon (in this case a cherry). At top is the player's score.]]

''Pac-Man'' is an [[Action game|action]]<ref name="Maynard"/> [[List of maze chase games|maze chase]] video game; the player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the eponymous character]] through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts—Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange)—who pursue Pac-Man. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. Levels are indicated by fruit icons at the bottom of the screen. In between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations.

If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he loses a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts has its own unique [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.), or "personality": Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man; Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him; and Clyde switches between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.<ref name="CNBC.com">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |author=Chris Morris|date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2022-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061417/https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |archive-date=October 15, 2012}}</ref>

Placed near the four corners of the maze are large flashing "energizers" or "power pellets". When Pac-Man eats one, the ghosts turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when a ghost is eaten, its eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze, where the ghost "regenerates" and resumes its normal activity. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. After a certain amount of time, blue-colored ghosts flash white before turning back into their normal forms. Eating a certain number of dots in a level causes a bonus item—usually a fruit—to appear underneath the center box; the item can be eaten for bonus points. To the sides of the maze are two "warp tunnels", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels.

The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses: the ghosts become faster, and the energizers' effect decreases in duration, eventually disappearing entirely. An [[integer overflow]] causes the 256th level to load improperly, rendering it impossible to complete.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cult Fiction |last1=Dwyer |first1=James |last2=Dwyer |first2=Brendan |publisher=Paused Books |year=2014 |isbn=9780992988401 |page=14}}</ref> This is known as a [[kill screen]].

''Pac-Man'' was ported to several home video game systems and personal computers; the most infamous of these is the 1982 [[Pac-Man (Atari 2600 video game)|Atari 2600 conversion]], designed by [[Tod Frye]] and published by [[Atari, Inc.]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lapetino|first=Tim|date=2018|title=The Story of PAC-MAN on Atari 2600|journal=Retro Gamer Magazine|volume=179|pages=18–23}}</ref> This version of the game was widely criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of the arcade version and for its peculiar design choices, most notably the flickering effect of the ghosts.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Creating a World of Clones |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |page=16 |date=October 9, 1983}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Thompson |first=Adam |title=The King of Video Games is a Woman |journal=Creative Computing Video and Arcade Games |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=65 |date=Fall 1983 |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n2/mspacman.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706072650/http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n2/mspacman.php |archive-date=July 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ratcliff |first=Matthew |title=Classic Cartridges II |journal=Antic |volume=7 |issue=4 |page=24 |date=August 1988 |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v7n4/classicii.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524113605/http://www.atarimagazines.com/v7n4/classicii.html |archive-date=May 24, 2010}}</ref> However, it was a commercial success, selling over seven million copies.

Upon its North American debut at AMOA 1980, the game initially received a mild response. ''[[Play Meter]]'' magazine previewed the game and called it "a cute game which appears to grow on players, something which cute games are not prone to do," saying that there's "more to the game than at first appears" but criticized the sound as a drawback, saying it is "good for awhile, then becomes annoying." Upon release, the game exceeded expectations with wide critical and commercial success.<ref name="PM94"/>

''Pac-Man'' was a turning point for the [[arcade video game]] industry, which had previously been dominated by space [[shoot 'em up]]s since ''[[Space Invaders]]'' (1978). ''Pac-Man'' popularized a genre of "character-led" [[action game]]s, leading to a wave of character action games involving [[player character]]s in 1981, such as [[Nintendo]]'s prototypical [[platform game]] ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', [[Konami]]'s ''[[Frogger]]'' and [[Universal Entertainment]]'s ''[[Lady Bug (video game)|Lady Bug]]''.<ref name="DK">{{cite news |title=Donkey Kong |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/donkey-kong-4/ |access-date=4 May 2021 |work=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing Limited]] |date=13 September 2008}}</ref> ''Pac-Man'' was one of the first popular non-shooting action games, defining key elements of the genre such as "parallel visual processing" which requires simultaneously keeping track of multiple entities, including the player's location, the enemies, and the energizers.<ref name="Maynard">{{cite book |last1=Maynard |first1=Ashley E. |last2=Subrahmanyam |first2=Kaveri |last3=Greenfield |first3=Patricia M. |chapter=Technology and the Development of Intelligence: From the Loom to the Computer |editor-last1=Sternberg |editor-first1=Robert J. |editor-last2=Preiss |editor-first2=David D. |title=Intelligence and Technology: The Impact of Tools on the Nature and Development of Human Abilities |date=13 May 2005 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-1-136-77805-6 |pages=29–54 (32) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZgVId2jGXIC&pg=PA32}}</ref>

Maze games became popular on home computers after the release of ''Pac-Man''. Some of them appeared before official ports and garnered more attention from consumers, and sometimes lawyers, as a result. These include ''[[Taxman (video game)|Taxman]]'' (1981) and ''[[Snack Attack]]'' (1982) for the Apple II, ''[[Jawbreaker (video game)|Jawbreaker]]'' (1981) for the Atari 8-bit computers, ''[[Scarfman]]'' (1981) for the TRS-80, and ''[[K.C. Munchkin!]]'' (1981) for the Odyssey². Namco produced several other maze games, including ''[[Rally-X]]'' (1980), ''[[Dig Dug]]'' (1982), ''[[Exvania]]'' (1992), and ''[[Tinkle Pit]]'' (1994).{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} Atari sued [[Philips]] for creating ''K.C.

==Reviews==
Reviewing home console versions in 1982, ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' magazine called the [[Atari 5200]] implementation a "splendidly reproduced" version of the arcade game, noting a difference in maze layouts for the television screen. It considered the [[Atari 2600]] version to have "much weaker graphics", but to still be one of the best games for that console. In both cases the reviewer felt that the [[joystick]] controls were harder to use than those of the arcade machine, and that "attempts to make quick turns are often frustrated".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/games-34-1982-december/page/n51/mode/2up | title=GAMES Magazine #34 | date=December 1982 }}</ref>

In December 1982, eight-year-old boy Jeffrey R.

''Pac-Man'' was followed by a series of sequels, remakes, and re-imaginings, and is one of the longest-running video game franchises in history. The first of these was ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'', developed by the American-based [[General Computer Corporation]] and published by Midway in 1982. The character's gender was changed to female in response to ''Pac-Man''{{'}}s popularity with women, with new mazes, moving bonus items, and faster gameplay being implemented to increase its appeal. ''Ms. Pac-Man'' is one of the best-selling arcade games in North America, where ''Pac-Man'' and ''Ms. Pac-Man'' had become the most successful machines in the history of the [[amusement arcade]] industry.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Past Presidents See Dip In Video Collections |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=20 November 1982 |page=56 |url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox44unse_23/page/56 |publisher=Cash Box Pub.

''Ms. Pac-Man'' inspired its own line of remakes, including ''[[Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness]]'' (2000), and ''[[Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze]]'', and is included in many Namco and ''Pac-Man'' collections for consoles.

Namco's own follow-up to the original was ''[[Super Pac-Man]]'', released in 1982.

==Technology==

The original arcade system board had one [[Z80]]A processor, running at 3.072&nbsp;MHz, 16&nbsp;kbyte of ROM and 3&nbsp;kbyte of static RAM. Of those 1&nbsp;kbyte each was for video RAM, color RAM and generic program RAM. There were two custom chips on the board: the 285 sync bus controller and the 284 video RAM addresser, but daughterboards made only from standard parts were also widely used instead. Video output was (analog) component video with composite sync. A further 8&nbsp;kbyte of character ROM was used for characters, background tiles and sprites and an additional 1&nbsp;kbit of static RAM was used to hold 4bpp sprite data for one scanline and was written to during the horizontal blanking period preceding each line. Sprite size was always 16x16 pixels, one of the four colors per pixel was for transparency (of the background).

The monitor was installed 90 degree rotated clockwise, the first visible scanline started in the top right corner and ends in the bottom right corner. The horizontal blanking period, which starts after the level indicator at the bottom is drawn, had a duration of 96 pixel clock ticks, enough time to fetch 4 bytes of sprite data per 16 clock ticks for 6 sprites. Although attribute memory exists for them, sprites 0 and 7 are unusable: Their pixel fetch timing windows are occupied by the bottom level indicator (which just precedes the hblank) for sprite 0 and two rows of characters at the top of the screen, which just follow the hblank, for sprite 7.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/P/Pac-Man.pdf|title=Midway's Pac-Man Parts and Operating Manual|date=December 1980}}</ref>
