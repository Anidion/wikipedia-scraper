Two scenarios are included:

'''Rebel Force''': A single-player scenario dealing with an invasion of a strategic Russian town by rebels. It was originally published as "Conflict" in Australia by Keating Computer Services.

'''Red Attack!''': A two-player competitive scenario dealing with attacking/defending three Russian towns. The battlefield is randomized - both players must agree on a fair one before the scenario begins.
