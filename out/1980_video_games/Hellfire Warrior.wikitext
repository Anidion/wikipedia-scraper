'''''Hellfire Warrior''''' is a [[dungeon crawl]] video game for the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore PET]], and [[TRS-80]] published by [[Automated Simulations]] in 1980. A port to [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was released in 1982.<ref name=mania/> ''Hellfire Warrior'' is the direct sequel to 1979's ''[[Temple of Apshai]]''. Two expansion packs were published.

==Gameplay==
''Hellfire Warrior'' leads players into the ruins that are unearthed below the Temple of Apshai. The levels are "The Lower Reaches of Apshai", "The Labyrinth" of the minotaur, "The Vault of the Dead" and "The Plains of Hell".<ref name="hellfire-manual">{{cite book|title=Dunjonquest: Hellfire Warrior|publisher=[[Epyx|Automated Simulations]]|year=1980|page=1}}</ref> Only the first and third levels have room numbers and descriptions. The game is meant for expert players and characters who already explored all the levels of ''Temple of Apshai'';<ref name="compute-hellfire">{{cite journal | title=Hellfire Warrior, Sequel to Temple of Apshai, Now Available | journal=Compute! | date=March 1981 | page=162}}</ref> advertisements warned that "newcomers to Dunjonquest should begin with something easier".<ref name="iw19810511">{{cite magazine |editor-last=Hogan |editor-first=Thom |date=27 April 1981 |title=Announcing "Hellfire Warrior" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DT4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA5 |magazine=[[InfoWorld]] |publisher=Popular Computing Inc. |location=[[Palo Alto, California]] |volume=3 |issue=8 |page=5 |issn=0199-6649 |type=advertisement}}</ref> The complexity is also increased, with more shops and several new strengthening potions, some of which can give the player character an addiction.<ref name="scorpia199110">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 | title=C*R*P*G*S / Computer Role-Playing Game Survey | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Scorpia | page=109}}</ref> While the focus is still mostly on becoming stronger and richer, the last level also has the secondary objective of rescuing a princess from hell, who is represented as a particularly heavy treasure.<ref name="softalk-hellfire">{{cite journal | title=Hellfire Warrior | journal=Softalk | date=December 1980 | page=21}}</ref> There is still no ending trigger related to this goal, though.<ref name="scorpia199110"/>

==Reception==
Forrest Johnson reviewed ''Hellfire Warrior'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 38.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Johnson |first=Forrest |date=April 1981 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=38|pages=35–36}}</ref> Johnson commented that "I won't forget my last view of Sanson - badly wounded, crawling desperately towards the exit, with sweet-but-cumbersome Brynhild in tow and an outraged fiend at his heels. If you enjoyed the earlier games, ''Hellfire Warrior'' is a must."<ref name="SG"/>

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1993 stated that ''Hellfire Warrior'' was "better than ''Apshai'', but not by too much", criticizing the outcome of rescuing the princess.<ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | accessdate=25 March 2016 | author=Scorpia | pages=34–50}}</ref>

==Expansions==
===''The Keys of Acheron'' (1981)===
The first expansion pack to ''Hellfire Warrior'' is ''The Keys of Acheron'' by designer [[Paul Reiche III]]. In it, the player attempts to recover four magical gems (the eponymous keys) for the wizard Abosandrus in order to prevent the immortal demon Kronus from invading the Earth. Kronus pursues the player through the four levels: "Abode of the Dragon", "The Temple in the Jungle", "The Crystal Caves", and "The Shadowland of Kronus."<ref name="acheron-manual">{{cite book |author=Staff writer |year=1981 |title=The Keys of Acheron: Expansion Kit #1 For Hellfire Warrior |series=Dunjonquest |url=https://archive.org/details/vgmuseum_epyx_acheron-manual |publisher=[[Epyx|Automated Simulations]] |location=Mt.

===''Danger in Drindisti'' (1982)===
The second expansion pack for ''Hellfire Warrior'' is ''Danger in Drindisti'' by designer Rudy Kraft. In it, the player attempts to defeat four enemies of the wizard Yoturni, the Wizard King of Drindisti.  Since a lack of room descriptions in level 6 and 8 are a restriction of the ''Hellfire Warrior'' program, the dungeons were built around that fact and are suggested to be played out of order: "The Glass Wizard" (level 7), "The Abode of the Illusionist" (level 6), "The Temple of the Demonmaster" (level 9), and "The Realm of Mist" (level 8).<ref name="drindisti-manual">{{cite book |author=Staff writer |year=1982 |title=Danger in Drindisti: Expansion Kit #2 For Hellfire Warrior |series=Dunjonquest |url=https://archive.org/details/agm_Danger_in_Drindisti_Manual |publisher=[[Epyx|Automated Simulations]] |location=Mt.
