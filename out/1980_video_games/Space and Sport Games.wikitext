==Reception==
Bruce F. Webster reviewed ''Space and Sport Games'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 35.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Webster |first=Bruce F.|date=January 1981 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=35|pages=28â€“29}}</ref> Webster commented that "There are nine games in all on this diskette, all of the same quality. I suspect all nine were placed there because the folks at Creative Computing couldn't justify selling them in smaller groups. I'm not sure they can justify selling them in this large group. Don't buy it."<ref name="SG"/>
