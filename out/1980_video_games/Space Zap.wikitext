'''''Space Zap''''' is a space-themed [[fixed shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed by Game-A-Tron and licensed to [[Midway Games|Midway Manufacturing]] in 1980.<ref name=klov>{{KLOV game|id=9692}}</ref><ref name="multiple">The Arcade Flyer Archive." - Video Game Flyers: 005, Sega-Gremlin. The Arcade Flyer Archive, 07 Mar. 2002. Web. 10 Nov. 2012. <http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=2505>3.</ref> The player controls the defenses of an immobile base in the center of the screen which is attacked from the top, bottom, left, and right. Pressing one of four oversized buttons moves the gun in the corresponding direction. A fifth button fires. ''Space Zap'' shipped in three form factors: standard upright, [[Cocktail table|cocktail]], and Bally's Mini-Myte reduced size cabinet.<ref name="multiple"/>

An official port of ''Space Zap'' for the [[Bally Astrocade]] was released in 1981 as ''Space Fortress''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Best Bally Astrocade Games of All-Time!|url=http://www.blockfort.com/game-lists/astrocade/|website=Blockfort}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The goal is to defend a base anchored in the center of the screen from [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] attackers that come from the four cardinal directions.<ref name="multiple"/> Four buttons are arranged in a diamond, corresponding to ''up'', ''down'', ''left'', and ''right''. If a projectile comes from the left, the player presses the left button to aim the gun in that direction, then a separate button to fire. If the player fails to fire in time, the base explodes. Each attack wave is punctuated by a [[satellite]] which circles the screen until it is shot or crashes into the base. After the first few levels, ''Space Zap'' becomes a high-speed reflex game. The player starts out with three lives.

The game allows up to two players, taking turns. The [[cocktail table]] version has two sets of controls, one on either side of the machine.<ref name="multiple"/>

250 points are awarded for destroying an alien projectile, 500 for the alien ship, and 2,000 for the end of level [[satellite]]. The player receives an extra life at the scores of 150,000, and 300,000.<ref name="multiple"/><ref>Dries, Dave. "CinemArcade.com: Space Zap!" CinemArcade.com: Space Zap! Jeffery Carl, n/a.

==Legacy==
''[[Cosmic Ark]]'', published by [[Imagic]] in 1982 for the [[Atari 2600]], started out as a clone of ''Space Zap''.<ref name="dp">{{cite web|last1=Stilphen|first1=Scott|title=DP Interviews Rob Fulop|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_rob_fulop.html|website=Digital Press}}</ref> In the final game, the first part of each level is ''Space Zap'' and a second sequence was added to keep it from being repetitive.

''Space Zap'' clones are numerous and include ''[[Outpost (1981 video game)|Outpost]]'' (1981) for the [[Apple II]], ''Colorzap'' (1982) for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boyle|first1=L. Curtis|title=Colorzap|url=http://www.lcurtisboyle.com/nitros9/colorzap.html|website=Tandy Color Computer Games List}}</ref> ''Cyclon'' (1983) for the [[VIC-20]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=The VideoGames Museum |title=VIC-20 Cyclon |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tk-ukiDeSQ |website=YouTube}}</ref> and ''Starship Pegasus'' (1984) for the [[TI-99/4A]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Starship Pegasus|url=http://videogamehouse.net/gamemain/cartss/starshippegasus/|website=TI-99/4A Videogame House}}</ref> In some clones a single joystick movement or key press shoots immediately—such as in ''Cosmic Ark''—instead of  separate controls for moving the weapon and firing it. [[Broderbund]]'s ''Master Type'' (1981) teaches keyboard familiarity by having to press to correct letter or punctuation key to fire the weapon.
