'''''The Search Series''''' is a five-game series of educational video games by [[Tom Snyder Productions]] and published by [[McGraw-Hill Education]] in 1980. It runs on either [[Apple II]] or [[TRS-80]] Models I and III.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDAEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22The+Search+Series%22+snyder&pg=PA24|title=InfoWorld|last=Inc|first=InfoWorld Media Group|date=1982-09-06|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>

==Development==
In the late 1970s, Snyder had bought a TRS-80 computer and began designing educational simulations on it. He hired a consultant for $500 a day to observe whether his creations had value. The consultant saw something special and won Snyder a contract [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]], who bought all five packages immediately, forming The Search Series.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/zetmoon/docs/compute_gazette_issue_16_1984_oct|title=Compute_Gazette_Issue_16_1984_Oct|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}</ref> Snyder went on the road in 1981 to promote the series.<ref name=":0"/>

===Educational goals===
The series exemplified Snyder's philosophy of keeping learning in the foreground of the gaming experience and encouraging players (recommended within the classroom) to work together in teams.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDAEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22The+Search+Series%22+snyder&pg=PA24|title=InfoWorld|last=Inc|first=InfoWorld Media Group|date=1982-09-06|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> The content was specifically designed to connect with curricula.<ref name="hub.mspnet.org">{{Cite web|url=http://hub.mspnet.org/index.cfm/9133/?print_friendly=true|title=Educational Technology: Support for Inquiry-Based Learning|website=hub.mspnet.org|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>

An example of the series is Geography Search, which simulates Christopher Columbus's discovery of the [[New World]]. Teams make navigational decisions based on information that is provided by and managed from the software.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qgKWdpZqwhUC&dq=%22geography+Search%22+snyder&pg=PA301|title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Volume 61 - Supplement 24|last1=Kent|first1=Allen|last2=Lancour|first2=Harold|date=1997-09-16|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780824720612|language=en}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Players are given scenarios, then (ideally) divide up into teams to choose the next move their defending their position. They input their decisions into the simulation which then triggers the next stage.<ref name="hub.mspnet.org"/>

== Reception ==
''Educational Values and Cognitive Instruction'' felt ''Geography Search'' was an excellent example of a computer-based situated learning environment based on a microworld.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQFeAgAAQBAJ&dq=%22The+Search+Series%22+snyder&pg=PA123|title=Educational Values and Cognitive Instruction: Implications for Reform|last1=Idol|first1=Lorna|last2=Jones|first2=Beau Fly|date=2013-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135434700|language=en}}</ref> InfoWorld was impressed with the software, and deemed them a great way to explore simulations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7y8EAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22The+Search+Series%22+snyder&pg=PA54|title=InfoWorld|last=Inc|first=InfoWorld Media Group|date=1983-04-18|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> In a piece for [[CNN]], Henry F.
