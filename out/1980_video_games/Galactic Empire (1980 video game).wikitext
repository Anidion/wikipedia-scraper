Many of the locations have names taken from African languages, such as Afrikaans or Swahili, based on Doug Carlston's years in Africa.{{r|wilson199111}} The game navigation uses a list of planets with names beginning with a unique letter of the alphabet for easy access. The 'R' key is reserved for 'Return', and 'Q' for 'Quit.'  The player has one fleet which travels from planet to planet, beginning with the home world 'Galactica.' Conquered planets can be taxed and produce troops used to take other planets. Each planet has a technology level above or below Galactica standard, which makes it easier or harder to conquer. It takes time to travel between planets to collect taxes and troops to conquer new planets. The player has 999 years to take the galaxy.

==Reception==
J. Mishcon reviewed ''Galactic Empire'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 30. He commented that "''Galactic Empire'' provides hours of play, but they can be frustrating and tedious hours. It is too easy to beat the system, and the game cannot be saved. A mediocre buy."<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Mishcon|first=J. |date=August 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=30|pages=28–29}}</ref> ''[[80 Micro]]'' in 1981 called ''Galactic Empire'' "one of the best game programs currently available for the TRS-80". The magazine described the game as "well designed and fun to play", stated that it "is never dull" with [[replayability]] from a random map generator, and approved of the addition of a save function on newer versions given that a session could last up to six hours. It concluded, "I heartily recommend Galactic Empire to anyone seeking a complex, intelligent, and of course, fun program."<ref name="cataldo198108">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/80-microcomputing-magazine-1981-08/80Microcomputing_0881#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Galactic Empire | work=80 Micro | date=August 1981 | accessdate=17 February 2015 | author=Cataldo, Dan | pages=39–40}}</ref>
