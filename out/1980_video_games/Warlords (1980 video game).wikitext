'''''Warlords''''' is an [[arcade video game]] released by [[Atari, Inc.]] in 1980.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hardcoregaming101.net/warlords/warlords.htm |title=Warlords - Arcade / Atari 2600 / Gameboy Advance / Nintendo DS / Windows / Xbox 360 / PSP / Playstation / Dreamcast (1980) |publisher=hardcoregaming101 |access-date=2012-12-04 |archive-date=2012-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223055819/http://hardcoregaming101.net/warlords/warlords.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> The game resembles a combination of ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'' and ''[[Quadrapong]]'' (an early Atari arcade game); up to four players play the game at the same time, and the "castles" in the four corners of the screen are brick walls that can be broken with a flaming ball.

''Warlords'' used spinner controllers for player control and came in both a two-player upright version and a four-player cocktail version. The upright version used a black and white monitor and reflected the game image onto a mirror, with a backdrop of castles, giving the game a 3D feel. The upright version only supported up to two simultaneous players, who moved through the levels as a team. The cocktail version was in color and supported 1–4 players. Three-to-four player games were free-for-alls where the game ended as soon as one player won. One-to-two player games played identical to the upright version.

According to Atari production numbers, 1014 uprights and 1253 cocktails were produced.  The prototype version of ''Warlords'' was called "Castles and Kings" and was housed in a large four-player "Sprint 4-like" cabinet.  Only two versions of the prototype were made.  The game was considered a success, although a redesign to a smaller cabinet was necessary, as the large cabinet made it impossible to produce in large quantities and unfeasible to install.

==Gameplay==
''Warlords'' is a battle between four warlords, 1-4 of which can be controlled by the player(s). The objective is to destroy the three other castles while protecting one's own castle with a moving shield.  Each castle is an L-shaped wall distinguished by a different color, each containing and protecting a Warlord icon (a crown for player-controlled Kings, a dark lord helmet for computer-controlled Black Knights).

The weapons for accomplishing this are spinning fireballs which bounce off anything they touch and destroy chunks of a castle wall on contact. Fireballs can be caught, held, and thrown by shields for greater hitting force, via a "Power stone" button, but at the cost of slowly deteriorating the player's own walls. When an icon is destroyed it releases another fireball onto the playfield, traveling in the opposite direction of the killing shot. The first fireball is launched by a dragon, always at a human player. Subsequent fireballs, up to a maximum of four at once, appear after timeouts or when a warlord icon is destroyed.

The last player with their icon intact is awarded a point bonus. A game ends when all human players are eliminated.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Warlords Operation, Maintenance and Service Manual|publisher=Atari Inc.|year=1981|pages=12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10405|title=Warlords - Videogame by Atari|website=www.arcade-museum.com|access-date=2017-05-07}}</ref>

== Development ==
The [[Atari 2600]] version of the game was released in 1981 and was written by [[Carla Meninsky]]. The debugger was Jerry Richardson.<ref name="Meninsky">{{cite web

The coin-op group developed the arcade version from the same "Castles and Kings" concept, adding and changing features to make the game more suitable for coin-operated play.

==Reception==
Critical reception of the game was positive. ''Warlords'' won an award for "Best '[[Pong]]' Variant" and an [[honorable mention]] for "Best Competitive Game" at the 3rd annual [[Arkie Awards]]. Arkie Award judges characterized the game as "something really new and different in 'Pong'-style designs", and commented that ''Warlords'' "delivers plenty of on-screen excitement".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Laney, Jr. |first2= Frank |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= January 1982 |title= Arcade Alley: The Third Annual Arcade Awards |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 5|issue= 10|pages= 28, 76–77|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|76}}

Richard A. Edwards reviewed the home cartridge version of ''Warlords'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 47.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last= Edwards |first= Richard A.  |date=January 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=47|pages=32}}</ref> Edwards commented that "If you have a need for a multi-player game for your Atari, then that is it.  But for one or two players, it'd be better to pass it up."<ref name="SG"/>

In 2009 ''[[Game Informer]]'' ranked it the 25th best video game of all time. The staff called it the "original trash-talking four-player combat game" and felt that it held up years later.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Informer's Top 100 Games Of All Time (Circa Issue 100) |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2009/11/16/game-informer-s-top-100-games-of-all-time-circa-issue-100.aspx |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |last=Cork |first=Jeff |date=2009-11-16 |access-date=2013-12-10}}</ref>
