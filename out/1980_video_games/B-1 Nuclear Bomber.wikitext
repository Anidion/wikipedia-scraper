==Gameplay==
The game box details a sample scenario set in the then-future of a bombing run over Moscow on July 1, 1991, which turned out to be just months before the official dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26 of that year.

==Reception==
Larry Kerns reviewed ''B-1 Nuclear Bomber'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 33. Kerns commented that <blockquote>Overall, I feel that the [...] price tag is too high and the game is quickly boring. The big fancy box is a waste and although putting all three languages on one tape is an innovative idea, two-thirds of what you bought is wasted. I expected more from Avalon Hill's baby but was disappointed. I hope their other new games are better.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Kerns |first=Larry |date=November 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=33|pages=36}}</ref></blockquote>

Chris Cummings reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that <blockquote>''B-1 Nuclear Bomber'' [...] will bring hours of fun, especially to the war monger who has always wondered what it would be like to sit in the cockpit of a sophisticated flying machine and drop a nuclear load on the 'enemy'.<ref name="CGW1">{{cite magazine |last=Cummings |first=Chris |title=B-1 Nuclear Bomber: A Strategic Map |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=November–December 1981 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=18–19}}</ref></blockquote>

In March 1983 ''B-1 Nuclear Bomber'' tied for eighth place in ''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]''{{'}}s Dog of the Year awards "for badness in computer games", [[Atari 8-bit computers]] division, based on reader submissions.<ref name="softline198303">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=6&id=10 | title=Everybody Doesn't Like Something | work=Softline | date=March 1983 | access-date=28 July 2014 | pages=22–23}}</ref> A 1992 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' survey of wargames with modern settings gave the game zero stars out of five, stating that "its play mechanics were embarrassing when it was initially released".{{r|brooks199206}} The magazine in 1994 said that AH's games such as ''B-1'' "were dated even when they were released back on the old 8-bit machines".<ref name="coleman199407">{{Cite magazine
