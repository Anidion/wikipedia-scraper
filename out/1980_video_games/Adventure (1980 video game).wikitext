'''''Adventure''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Warren Robinett]] for the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed [[Atari 2600]]) and released in [[1980 in video gaming|1980]] by [[Atari, Inc.]] The player controls a square [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] whose quest is to explore an open-ended environment to find a magical [[chalice]] and return it to the golden castle. The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and moves items around the game world. ''Adventure'' introduced new elements to console games, including enemies that continue to move when offscreen.

The game was conceived as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]''. Warren Robinett spent approximately one year designing and coding the game, while overcoming a variety of technical limitations in the [[Atari 2600]] console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. As a result of conflicts with Atari's management which denied giving public credit for programmers, Robinett programmed a secret room that contained his name within the game, only found by players after the game shipped and Robinett had left Atari. While not the first such [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]], Robinett's secret room pioneered this idea within video games and other forms of media, and since has transcended into popular culture, such as the climax of [[Ernest Cline]]'s book and film adaption ''[[Ready Player One]]''.

''Adventure'' received mostly positive reviews at the time of its release and in the decades since, often named as one of the industry's most influential games and [[List of video games considered the best|among the greatest video games of all time]]. It is considered the first [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] and console [[fantasy]] game, and inspired other games in the genres. More than [[List of best-selling Atari 2600 video games|one million cartridges]] of ''Adventure'' were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer hardware. The game's prototype code was used as the basis for the [[Superman (1979 video game)|1979 ''Superman'' game]], and a planned sequel eventually formed the basis for the ''[[Swordquest]]'' games.

==Gameplay==
[[File:atariadventure.png|thumb|The player with the White Key in the White Castle's [[catacombs]], pursued by the green [[dragon]], Grundle]]

In ''Adventure'', the player's goal is to recover the Enchanted [[Chalice]] that an evil magician has stolen and hidden in the kingdom and return it to the Golden Castle.{{sfn|Atari|p=1|1980|ref=manual}} The kingdom is made of a total of 30 rooms, with various obstacles, enemies, and mazes located in and around the Golden, White, and Black Castles. The kingdom is guarded by three [[European dragon|dragons]]{{mdash}}the yellow Yorgle, the green Grundle, and the red Rhindle{{mdash}}that protect or flee from various items and attack the player's avatar.{{sfn|Atari|p=5|1980|ref=manual}} An enemy bat can roam the kingdom freely, carrying an item or a dragon around; the bat was to be named Knubberrub but the name is not in the manual.<ref name="arthurshallinterview">{{cite web | url=http://www.arthurshall.com/x_adventure.shtml | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122075921/http://arthurshall.com/x_adventure.shtml|title=Warren Robinett Interview: A.

When in the agitated state, the bat will either pick up or swap what it currently carries with an object in the present room, eventually returning to the non-agitated state where it will not pick up an object. The bat continues to fly around even offscreen, swapping objects.<ref name=wolf2008/><ref name="theory"/>

The player's avatar is a simple square shape that can move within and between rooms, each represented by a single screen.{{sfn|Robinett|2006|p=709|ref=DesignReader}} Helpful objects include keys that open the castles, a magnet that pulls items towards the player, a magic bridge that the player can use to cross certain obstacles, and a sword which can be used to defeat the dragons.{{sfn|Robinett|2006|p=694|ref=DesignReader}} The player may only carry one object at a time. If eaten by a dragon, the player can then opt to resurrect the dead avatar instead of completely restarting the game. The avatar reappears at the Golden Castle and all objects remain at their latest location, but all slain dragons are resurrected.{{sfn|Robinett|2006|p=700|ref=DesignReader}} The ability to resurrect the avatar without resetting the entire game is considered one of the earliest examples of a "continue game" option in video games.<ref name="usgamer interview"/>

The game offers three different skill levels. Level 1 is the easiest, as it uses a simplified room layout and doesn't include the White Castle, bat, Rhindle, nor invisible mazes. Level 2 is the full version of the game, with the various objects appearing in set positions at the start. Level 3 is similar to Level 2, but the location of the objects is randomized for a greater challenge. The player can use the difficulty switches on the Atari 2600 to further control the game's difficulty; one switch controls the dragons' bite speed, and one causes them to flee when the player carries the sword.{{sfn|Atari|p=6|1980|ref=manual}}

''Adventure'' was designed and programmed by Atari employee [[Warren Robinett]], and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Atari, Inc.]] At the time, Atari programmers were generally given full control on the creative direction and development cycle for their games, and this required them to plan for their next game as they neared completion of their current one to stay productive.<ref name="usgamer interview">{{cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/warren-robinett-interview | title = "Could they fire me?

Robinett began designing his graphics-based game with the help of a [[Hewlett-Packard]] 1611A logic analyzer (a debugging tool) around May to June 1978.{{sfn|Robinett|2006|p=690|ref=DesignReader}}<ref name="wired"/> He was soon aware that memory use was critical because Atari 2600 cartridge ROMs have only 4096 [[byte]]s (4 [[kilobyte|KB]]),<ref name=wolf2008/> and the system has 128 bytes of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] for program variables.{{sfn|Bogost, Montfort|2009|p=14|ref=Beam}} In contrast, ''Colossal Cave Adventure'' uses hundreds of kilobytes of memory on a large computer.<ref name="wired"/> The final game uses nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of the cartridge storage for Robinett's [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]]),<ref name="autogenerated2001"/> with 15 unused bytes from the ROM capacity.<ref name="wired"/> Robinett credits [[Ken Thompson]], his professor at [[University of California, Berkeley]], with teaching him the skills needed to use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required his students to learn the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] that he had invented at [[AT&T]], and Robinett carried C techniques into assembly language.<ref name="arstech gdc"/>

Robinett first identified ways to translate the elements of ''Colossal Cave Adventure'' into simple, easily recognizable graphics that the player interacts with directly, replacing text-based commands with joystick controls.<ref name="usgamer interview"/><ref name="wired"/> Due to the system's low resolution pixels, Robinett noted the dragons look more like [[duck]]s.<ref name="wired"/> Robinett developed [[workaround]]s for various technical limitations of the Atari 2600, which has only one playfield and five [[Addressing mode#Memory-mapped registers|memory-mapped register]]s available to represent moving objects. Only two of these registers are capable of representing more complex [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], so he used those for objects and creatures within the game. He used the register originally designated for the ball in games such as ''[[Pong]]'' to represent the player's [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]. Finally, he used the registers assigned for missiles, such as the bullets in ''[[Combat (video game)|Combat]]'', for additional walls in the playing field to be able to represent different rooms within the game with the same playfield.{{sfn|Bogost, Montfort|2009|p=52|ref=Beam}}<ref name="usgamer interview"/> Another hardware limitation forces the left and right sides of nearly every screen to be mirrored, which fostered the creation of the game's confusing mazes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gooddealgames.com/interviews/int_Warren_Robinett.html | title=Good Deal Games Warren Robinett Interview | publisher=Gooddealgames.com | year=2003 | access-date=December 12, 2012 | archive-date=May 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511090546/http://www.gooddealgames.com/interviews/int_Warren_Robinett.html | url-status=live }}</ref> The exceptions include two screens in the Black Castle catacombs and two in the main hallway beneath the Golden Castle. They are mirrored, but contain a vertical wall object in the room to make an asymmetrical screen, as well as provide a secret door for an Easter egg.{{sfn|Bogost, Montfort|2009|p=59|ref=Beam}} Robinett originally intended for all rooms to be bidirectionally connected, but programming bugs make a few such connections unidirectional, which are explained away as "bad magic" in the game's manual.{{sfn|Robinett|2006|p=709|ref=DesignReader}}

Robinett overcame these limitations to introduce concepts novel to video games. He constructed thirty different rooms in the games, whereas most games of the time present only a single screen.<ref name="wired"/> Furthermore, off-screen objects such as the bat continue to move according to their programming behavior.<ref name="wired"/>

In addition to the technical limitations, Robinett had struggled with Atari's management over the game. Around the time of ''Adventure''{{'}}s development, Atari, now owned by [[Warner Communications]], had hired [[Ray Kassar]] as general manager of their Consumer Division, and he was later promoted to president and CEO of Atari in December 1978. Kassar interacted with the programmers rarely and generally treated their contributions with indifference.<ref name="paste mar2016">{{Cite web | url = http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/easter-eggs-the-hidden-secrets-of-videogames.html | title = Easter Eggs: The Hidden Secrets of Videogames | first = Jack | last = Yarwood | work = [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] | date = March 27, 2016 | access-date = March 27, 2016 | archive-date = March 30, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160330033934/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/easter-eggs-the-hidden-secrets-of-videogames.html | url-status = live }}</ref> Robinett was initially discouraged from working on ''Adventure'' by his supervisor, George Simcock, who said the ambitious game could not be done on Atari 2600 based on knowing how much memory ''Colossal Cave Adventure'' uses.<ref name="usgamer interview"/><ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="GamaSutra">{{cite web |last = Wallis |first = Alistair |title = Playing Catch Up: Adventure's Warren Robinett |publisher = [[Gamasutra]] |url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13280 | date=March 29, 2007 |access-date = October 11, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071018072813/http://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13280| archive-date=October 18, 2007}}</ref> When Robinett developed a working prototype within one month, Atari's management team was impressed, encouraging him to continue the game.<ref name="usgamer interview"/><ref name="arstech gdc"/> The management later tried to convince Robinett to make it a tie-in work for the upcoming ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' movie, which was owned by Warner Communication, but Robinett remained committed to his initial idea.<ref name="wired"/> Instead, Atari developer John Dunn agreed to take Robinett's prototype source code to make the [[Superman (1979 video game)|1979 ''Superman'' game]].<ref name="usgamer interview"/><ref name="arstech gdc">{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/atari-devs-dissect-yars-revenge-adventure-ataris-woes/ | title = Atari devs dissect Yars' Revenge, Adventure, Atari's woes | first = Sam | last = Machkovech | date = March 14, 2015 | access-date = March 27, 2016 | work = [[Ars Technica]] | archive-date = March 29, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160329054005/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/atari-devs-dissect-yars-revenge-adventure-ataris-woes/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

A second prototype was completed near the end of 1978, with only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects. Robinett recognized that it demonstrated his design goals, but was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas, finishing it by June 1979.<ref name="usgamer interview"/><ref name="Halcyon"/> Two changes were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon and resetting the avatar, and the addition of the sword object with which to kill the dragon. Robinett found that the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same [[source code]] for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could irretrievably drop an object into a wall space.<ref name="usgamer interview"/>

To develop the plot for the game, Robinett worked with Steve Harding, the author for nearly all Atari 2600 game manuals at that time. Harding developed most of the plot after playing the game, with Robinett revising elements where he saw fit. Robinett states that he had come up with the names for the three dragons and offered a friend's suggestion for naming the bat "Knubberrub".<ref name="usgamer interview"/>

==Easter egg==

[[File:Atari Adventure Easter Egg on Atari (Jakks Pacific) Port.jpg|thumb|In the Atari Classics 10-in-1 TV Games by Jakks Pacific, the creator's name was removed and replaced with "TEXT?".]]

Generally defined as a "message, trick, or unusual behavior hidden inside a computer program by its creator", the Easter egg concept was popularized by ''Adventure'', influenced by the corporate culture at Atari. After Atari's acquisition by [[Warner Communications]] in 1976, there was a culture clash between the executives from New York, and the Californian programmers who were more laid back.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/technology/easter-eggs-tesla-google.html|title=The Secret History of 'Easter Eggs'|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 8, 2019|last=Pogue|first=David|access-date=August 8, 2019|archive-date=August 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808091108/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/technology/easter-eggs-tesla-google.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Atari removed the names of game developers from their products, as a means to prevent competitors from identifying and recruiting Atari's programmers.{{sfn|Bogost, Montfort|2009|p=60|ref=Beam}}<ref name="paste mar2016"/> This also was used as a means to deny the developers a bargaining chip in any negotiations they may have with management, according to Robinett.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fatsquatch|title=Of Dragons and Easter Eggs: A Chat With Warren Robinett|url=https://tjg.joeysit.com/of-dragons-and-easter-eggs-a-chat-with-warren-robinett/|website=The Jaded Gamer|access-date=February 3, 2021|date=May 13, 2003|archive-date=April 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417200945/https://tjg.joeysit.com/of-dragons-and-easter-eggs-a-chat-with-warren-robinett/|url-status=live}}</ref> These attitudes led to the departure of several programmers; notably, [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]], [[Larry Kaplan]], [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]], and [[Bob Whitehead]] all left Atari due to lack of recognition and [[royalty payment]]s, and formed [[Activision]] as a third-party 2600 developer, making many hit games in competition with Atari.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131956/a_history_of_gaming_platforms_.php | title = A History of Gaming Platforms: Atari 2600 Video Computer System/VCS | first1 = Matt | last1 = Barton | first2 = Bill | last2 = Loguidice | work = [[Gamasutra]] | date = February 28, 2008 | access-date = April 5, 2016 | archive-date = May 9, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120509091540/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131956/a_history_of_gaming_platforms_.php | url-status = live }}</ref>

Unknown to anyone else, Robinett embedded his name in his game in the form of a hidden and virtually inaccessible room displaying the text "Created by Warren Robinett",<ref name="GamaSutra" /> inspired by popular rumors that [[the Beatles]] had [[Hidden message|hidden messages]] in songs.<ref name="paste mar2016"/> In 2015, Robinett recalled the message as a means of self-promotion, noting that Atari had paid him only around US$22,000 per year without any royalties, while Atari would sell one million units of a game at US$25 apiece.<ref name="wired"/> This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.<ref name="autogenerated2001">{{cite book | last=Kent | first=Steven L. |authorlink= Steven L. Kent | title=[[The Ultimate History of Video Games]] | year=2001 | publisher=Three Rivers Press | isbn=0-7615-3643-4}}</ref>

Robinett kept the secret for more than one year, even from all Atari employees.<ref name="paste mar2016"/> He was unsure of whether it would be discovered by other Atari personnel prior to publishing. It is not mentioned in the game's manual, as the manual's author was unaware.  After the game was released, Adam Clayton, a fifteen-year-old from [[Salt Lake City]], discovered it and sent a letter of explanation to Atari.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter to Atari from Adam Clayton |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/game_library/easter_eggs/vcs/adventure_letter.pdf |website=Atari Compendium |access-date=29 April 2019 |archive-date=19 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819062530/http://www.ataricompendium.com/game_library/easter_eggs/vcs/adventure_letter.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="paste mar2016"/> Robinett had already quit the company by this point, so Atari tasked designers with finding the responsible code. The employee who found it said that if he were to fix it, he would change the message in the game to say "Fixed by Brad Stewart". Furthermore, the cost of creating a new [[read-only memory]] (ROM) [[mask ROM|mask]], or memory [[integrated circuit|chip]], was around {{US$|10000|1980}} at the time of the game's release, making this change a costly endeavor.{{sfn|Bogost, Montfort|2009|p=61|ref=Beam}}<ref name="wired"/> Steve Wright, the director of software development of the Atari Consumer Division, argued for retaining the message, believing it gave players additional incentive to find it and play their games more, and suggested these were like [[Easter egg]]s for players to find.<ref name="paste mar2016"/> Atari eventually decided to leave the access mechanism in-game, and dubbed such hidden features "Easter eggs",{{sfn|Robinett|2006|p=713|ref=DesignReader}} saying they would be adding more such secrets to later games.<ref>{{cite journal | editor=Frank Laney Jr. | title=Electronic Games Hotline | journal=[[Electronic Games]] | page=14 | volume=1 | issue=1|date=December 1981 }}</ref> Wright made it an official policy at Atari that all future games should include Easter eggs, often limited to being the initials of the game developer.<ref name="paste mar2016"/>

The Easter egg is accessed by setting difficulty levels 2 or 3 and first retrieving the Gray Dot from the Black Castle catacombs.<ref name="Halcyon">{{cite web |last = Hague |first = James |title = Halcyon Days: Warren Robinett |url = http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/ROBINETT.HTM |access-date = October 11, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005831/http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/ROBINETT.HTM| archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> The dot is a single pixel object which is invisibly embedded in the south wall of a sealed chamber accessible only with the bridge, and the player must bounce the avatar along the bottom wall to pick it up. The dot can be seen when in a catacombs passage or when held over a normal wall, and becomes again invisible when carried or dropped in most rooms. The dot is not attracted to the magnet, unlike all other inanimate objects. The player must bring the dot along with two or more other objects to the east end of the corridor below the Golden Castle. This causes the barrier on the right side of the screen to blink rapidly, and the player avatar is then able to push through the wall into a new room displaying the words "Created by Warren Robinett" in text which continuously changes color.{{sfn|Bogost, Montfort|2009|p=60|ref=Beam}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Petty |first1=Jared |title=Gaming's First Easter Egg - Adventure Let's Play with Creator Warren Robinett |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/05/gamings-first-easter-egg-adventure-lets-play-with-creator-warren-robinett |website=IGN |access-date=July 24, 2018 |date=March 5, 2015 |archive-date=July 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724154515/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/05/gamings-first-easter-egg-adventure-lets-play-with-creator-warren-robinett |url-status=live }}</ref>

''Adventure'' received mostly positive reviews in the years immediately after its release and has generally been viewed positively since then.

[[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]] and Frank Laney in the January 1981 issue of ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' called ''Adventure'' a "major design breakthrough" and that it "shatters several video-game conventions" such as scoring and time limits.

Jeremy Parish of ''[[1UP.com]]'' wrote in 2010 that ''Adventure'' is "a work of interpretive brilliance" that "cleverly extracted the basic elements of exploration, combat and treasure hunting from the text games and converted them into icons", but also conceded that it "seems almost unplayably basic these days".<ref name="1up">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-adventure |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524035145/http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-adventure |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 24, 2011 |title=The Essential 50 Part 4 – Adventure |publisher=1UP.com |year=2010 |first=Jeremy |last=Parish |access-date=December 17, 2012 }}</ref>
