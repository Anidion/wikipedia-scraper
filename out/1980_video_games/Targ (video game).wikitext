==Gameplay==

The locale, described by the game cabinet as "The Crystal City", is a 10x10 grid of roads demarcated by square buildings. The player, piloting the ''Wummel'', which looks like a small green car, maneuvers through the maze trying to shoot enemies and avoid collisions with them. Most of the enemies consist of angry-looking red wedges known as ''Targs''. Occasionally, a small cyan-colored Spectar Smuggler appears; shooting it scores a significant bonus.  None of the enemies shoot back; their sole means of destroying the Wummel is ramming into it.

When all enemies are destroyed, a bonus is awarded and a new round starts. If the player takes too long to clear the board, the Targs' speed increases until they are traveling faster than the Wummel.

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Games]]'' stated in 1983 that ''Targ'' had "one of the most unique approaches to the maze-chase contest".<ref name="pearl198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n79/mode/2up | title=Closet Classics | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=6 January 2015 | author=Pearl, Rick | pages=82}}</ref> In his 1981 video game guide ''How to Master the Video Games'' Tom Hirschfeld observed that "TARG is one game in which strategy must become almost reflex as the action quickens".<ref name="hirschfeld_book">{{cite book | last=Hirschfeld | first=Tom | date=1981 | title=How to Master the Video Games | location=Toronto, New York, London, Sydney | publisher=Bantam Books | page=118-120 | isbn=0553201646 | quote=TARG is one game in which strategy must become almost reflex as the action quickens. | quote-page=120}}</ref>
