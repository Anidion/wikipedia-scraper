==Technology==
The game is housed in a custom cabinet that includes a [[light gun]]. The game [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] is composed of discrete technology, with game sprites stored in [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. Playfield graphics are provided by a screen overlay representing an Old West town street.<ref name="klov" />

==Gameplay==
Players select one of two characters: Half-fast Pete or Billy-The-Kid. Pete is more accurate while Billy can draw faster. An outlaw appears somewhere in the town, the object being to fast draw a gun as soon as he draws his. Shooting him scores points, with points counting toward end-of-game ratings such as "Dude", "Greenhorn", and "Top Gun".<ref name="klov" />
