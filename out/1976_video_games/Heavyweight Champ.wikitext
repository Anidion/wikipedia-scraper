{{nihongo foot|'''''Heavyweight Champ'''''|ヘビーウェイトチャンプ|Hebīweito Chanpu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a series of boxing video games from [[Sega]]. The original [[arcade video game]] was released in 1976. The game uses black-and-white graphics and critics have since identified it as the first [[Fighting game|video game to feature hand-to-hand fighting]].<ref name="tao">Spencer, Spanner, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-tao-of-beat-em-ups-article?page=1 The Tao of Beat-'em-ups], ''EuroGamer'', Feb 6 2008, Accessed Feb 23, 2009</ref><ref name="ashcraft">Ashcraft, Brian, (2008) ''Arcade Mania!

Sega released a [[video game remake|remake]] to arcades in 1987, changing the side perspective of the original game to a third-person viewpoint from behind the [[Boxer (boxing)|boxer]]. Both games feature unique [[Game controller|controls]] that [[Motion controller|simulate]] throwing actual punches.<ref name="tao"/> The 1987 remake was Japan's fifth highest-grossing [[1988 in video games|arcade video game of 1988]] and received positive reviews from critics.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Heavyweight Champ screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The 1976 game has monochrome graphics and side-view perspective.]]
The 1976 original featured gameplay viewed from a side-view perspective. It employed two [[boxing glove]] controllers, one for each player, which moved up and down for high and low punches, with an inward movement for striking.<ref name="tao"/> It used large [[monochrome]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] visuals for the graphics.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZnpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|title=Vintage Game Consoles: An Inside Look at Apple, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and the Greatest Gaming Platforms of All Time|first1=Bill|last1=Loguidice|first2=Matt|last2=Barton|date=24 February 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781135006518|accessdate=8 October 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>

The 1987 game changed the perspective to behind the player's boxer. In addition, the player is given two punch controllers, one for each hand. Only a single-player mode was made available, in which the player faces a series of opponents in one-round, three-minute bouts. Players can swivel the [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]] to move their boxer from side to side.<ref name=KLOV1987>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8098|title=Heavyweight Champ (1987)|publisher=International Arcade Museum|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref>

==Reception==
The original 1976 game was a commercial success in Japan. On the first annual ''[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]'' arcade chart, ''Heavyweight Champ'' was the third highest-grossing [[1976 in video games|arcade video game of 1976]] in Japan, just below [[Taito]]'s ''Ball Park'' and ''[[Speed Race|Speed Race DX]]''.<ref name="GM65">{{cite magazine|title=本紙アンケー 〜 ト調査の結果|trans-title=Paper Questionnaire: Results of the Survey |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=65|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 February 1977|page=2|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19770201p.pdf#page=2}}</ref>

The 1987 remake was also a commercial success. In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed the 1987 version on their November 15 issue as being the fourth most-successful upright arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=320|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 November 1987|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref> It went on to become Japan's fifth highest-grossing dedicated [[1988 in video games|arcade game of 1988]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '88 ''/ "Game of the Year '88" By Game Machine'' |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=348 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=15 January 1989 |pages=10–1, 26 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19890115p.pdf#page=6}}</ref>

The 1987 remake was also critically well-received. ''[[Advanced Computer Entertainment]]'' and ''[[Commodore User]]'' praised the game's unique controls but raised concerns that they might decrease the lifespan of the cabinets.<ref name=ACE>"[http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/10/175/heavyweight_champ_review.html Heavyweight Champ"].

''Commodore User''. December 1987. p. 144</ref> ''Commodore User'' also had positive impressions of the game's graphics and gave the game a 9 out of 10 overall.<ref name=CU2>Kelly, Nick.

==Legacy==
Sega reused the ''Heavyweight Champ'' name when they released the Sega Master System version of ''James "Buster" Douglas Knockout Boxing'' outside of North America. The game features a side perspective and is otherwise unrelated to the arcade games. It was not received well.<ref name=MM>[http://www.smspower.org/Scans/MeanMachines-Magazine-Issue07?gallerypage=58 Heavyweight Championship Boxing]. Mean Machines.

CVG's Complete Guide to Sega. pp. 95-96.</ref>

The 1991 Sega arcade game ''Title Fight'' also featured controls for left and right punches and a similar behind-the-boxer perspective as the 1987 game, along with two-player gameplay through use of a dual-monitor cabinet.<ref name=KLOV2>[http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10129 Title Fight].
