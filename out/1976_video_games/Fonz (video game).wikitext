The game was based on the character [[Fonzie]] (portrayed by [[Henry Winkler]]) from the 1970s TV show ''[[Happy Days]]'', with the slogan being "TV's hottest name, Your hottest game". Sega licensed ''Fonz'' because at the time it was owned by [[Charles Bluhdorn]]'s [[Gulf+Western|Gulf+Western Company]] and it was a [[Paramount Television]] intellectual property.

A [[two-player]] version of ''Man T.T.'' called {{nihongo foot|'''''Twin Course T.T.'''''|ツインコースT.T.|Tsuin Kōsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released in January 1977.<ref name="Famitsu1977">{{cite book |chapter=1977-78 |title=Sega Arcade History |date=2002 |series=[[Famitsu DC]] |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |pages=33–6 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/segaarcadehistoryfamitsudc/page/n34 |language=ja}}</ref>

==Overview==
[[File:Fonz 1976 sega arcade.PNG|150px|thumb|left|Arcade cabinet]]
''Moto-Cross'' / ''Fonz'' is an early black-and-white [[motorbike]] racing game, most notable for introducing an early [[2.5D|three-dimensional]] [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective. Both versions of the game display a constantly changing forward-[[scrolling]] road and the player's bike in a third-person perspective where objects nearer to the player are larger than those nearer to the horizon, and the aim was to steer the vehicle across the road, racing against the clock, while avoiding any on-coming motorcycles or driving off the road.<ref name=Moto-Cross>{{KLOV game|12812|Moto-Cross}}</ref> The game also introduced the use of [[haptic technology|haptic feedback]], which caused the [[motorcycle handlebar]]s to vibrate during a [[collision detection|collision]] with another vehicle.<ref>Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), ''The video game explosion: a history from PONG to PlayStation and beyond'', p. 39, [[ABC-CLIO]], {{ISBN|0-313-33868-X}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The general premise has the player controlling [[Fonzie]] on a [[motorcycle]] with handlebars on the cabinet.

The player has to go as fast as possible without skidding off the road or colliding with other racing bikes on the screen. Turn the handlebars, and the bike will corner and bank. Twist the handle throttle open, and it will accelerate. When a collision with another bike occurs, the handlebars vibrate and the screen flashes a reverse image. To increase the challenge, the size of the bike can be regulated by the operator.

Game time is adjustable from 45 to 100 seconds.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Road Race'' was among the top twenty highest-grossing [[1976 in video games|arcade video games of 1976]], according to the first annual ''[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]'' chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=本紙アンケー 〜 ト調査の結果|trans-title=Paper Questionnaire: Results of the Survey |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=65|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 February 1977|page=2|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19770201p.pdf#page=2}}</ref> In North America, ''Road Race'' was reported to be doing strong business upon release.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=California Clippings |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=July 31, 1976 |page=48 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1976/Cash-Box-1976-07-31.pdf#page=48}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Eastern Flashes |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=August 7, 1976 |page=47 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1976/Cash-Box-1976-08-07.pdf#page=47}}</ref> ''Man T.T.'' was among the top ten highest-grossing [[1977 in video games|arcade video games of 1977]] in Japan.<ref name="GM90">{{cite magazine|title=結果ベスト3|trans-title=Best 3 Results |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=90|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 February 1978|page=2|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19780215p.pdf#page=2}}</ref>

''Fonz'' was introduced at [[Chicago]]'s Music Operators Association (MOA) show in November 1976. It was the first time that a television character was licensed for a video game, with Sega co-founder [[David Rosen (businessman)|David M. Rosen]] predicting the start of a new coalition between the [[show business]] and [[amusement arcade]] industries. Sega also advertised the game for having both the road and bikes seen in "true perspective on the game screen, while the player operates realistically functioning handle-bars to simulate high-speed competition riding complete with authentic motor sounds". Sega said the response to the game at the MOA show was "unanimous and enthusiastic" and that test location results were very positive. At the start of December 1976, [[Sega of America]] reported that it had manufactured several hundred ''Fonz'' arcade cabinets.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Sega Races With 'Fonz' Game |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=December 4, 1976 |page=41 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1976/Cash-Box-1976-12-04.pdf#page=42}}</ref>
