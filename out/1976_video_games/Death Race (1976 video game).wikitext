'''''Death Race''''' is an [[arcade game|arcade]] [[driving video game]] developed and released by [[Exidy]] in the [[United States]], first shipping to arcade distributors in April 1976.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=http://allincolorforaquarter.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-ultimate-so-far-history-of-exidy_24.html |title=The Golden Age Arcade Historian: The Ultimate (So Far) History of Exidy - Part 2 |last=Smith |first=Keith |date=2013-05-24 |website=The Golden Age Arcade Historian |access-date=2017-11-06}}</ref> The game was a modification of Exidy's 1975 game ''[[Destruction Derby (1975 video game)|Destruction Derby]]'' in which players crashed into cars to accrue points. In ''Death Race'', the objective became to run into "gremlins" to gain score. The game could be played with one or two players controlling different cars. The original working title for the game which appeared on some early advertisements was '''''Death Race 98'''''.<ref name=":1" />

The game attracted a great deal of [[Video game controversies|controversy]] over the content of the game which was centered around killing humanoid figures. In July 1976, newspapers and civic organizations began to attack the game for facilitating violence in virtual form.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/288123577 |title='Death Race': Cartoon or Morbid? |last=New York Times News Service |date=December 28, 1976 |work=The Post-Crescent |access-date=2017-08-30 |page=A-1 |language=en |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19761229&id=eiFOAAAAIBAJ&pg=6835,5559430 |title=Local Safety Authorities Denounce Game |last=Young |first=Larry |date=December 29, 1976 |work=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |location=Spokane |page=10}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcuniversalarchives.com/nbcuni/clip/5112448529_s01.do |title=Weekend: That's Nice, Don't Fight (Death Race) Archival Footage |work=[[NBCUniversal]] |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Musée Mécanique 221.JPG|thumb|216x216px|An upright cabinet]]
In the game, one or two players control an on-screen car with a steering wheel and an acceleration pedal. The object is to run down "gremlins" who are fleeing the vehicle. As the player hits them, they scream or squeal and are replaced on-screen by tombstones. This increases the challenge of the game as the screen clutters up and the player has to avoid the tombstones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/08/23/death-race |title=Death Race |last=Buchanan |first=Levi |work=[[IGN]] |date=August 23, 2008 |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}</ref>

The cabinet is black-with-white graphics of a muscle car racing through a cemetery with a vulture in a tree looking on. The marquee and monitor bezel are colored. A limited number had white sides with the artwork in black, instead of the reverse. It was in an upright standard racing-style cabinet.

== History ==
In 1975, Exidy licensed its game ''[[Destruction Derby (1975 video game)|Destruction Derby]]'' to arcade game company [[Chicago Coin]] to manufacture. However, the following year Chicago Coin entered financial difficulties which would eventually lead to the dissolution of the company, and as Exidy had sold exclusive manufacturing rights they could no longer profit from ''Destruction Derby''.<ref name=":1" />

Needing an interim product to introduce to distributors, they decided to modify the ''Destruction Derby'' game so that it would be saleable by their organization. Newly-arrived engineer [[Howell Ivy]] from [[Ramtek (company)|Ramtek]] made several modifications to ''Destruction Derby'' in order to create this new product.<ref name=":5">{{Cite magazine |last=Drury |first=Paul |year=2014 |title=Interview with Howell Ivy |journal=Retro Gamer |issue=125}}</ref> He added curbs to the left and right of the screen that the enemies could hide behind, but players would be stalled if they attempted to cross over. On the top and bottom of the screen, players could wrap around to the opposite side in a manner similar to Atari's [[Space Race (video game)|''Space Race'']] (1973).<ref name=":1" />

The enemy opponents were changed to animated figures which walked around the screen instead of vehicles. These 'gremlins' would wander the playspace until one of the players collided with them, at which point they would let out a 'screech' and leave behind a cross representing a tombstone. Though a number of sources have reported that the game was a licensed adaptation of the 1975 film ''[[Death Race 2000]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Carmaggedon{{sic}} |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=25  |date=January 1997 |page=125}}</ref> Exidy has denied that this was the case.<ref name=":1" /> The name "Death Race" was chosen as a reflection of the undead monsters depicted in the cabinet art and marketing, both devised by artist Michael Cooper-Hart.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |last=Cognevich |first=Valarie |title=Coinman: Paul Jacobs |journal=Milwaukee Coin Machine}}</ref>

Exidy only intended ''Death Race'' as an interim product until their subsequent game ''Car Polo'' (1977) was completed. Viewed from an aerial perspective, the gremlins look very similar to humans and this got the attention of national news programs such as ''[[60 Minutes]]''.<ref>Wardyga, B. J. (2019). The video games textbook: History, Business, Technology. CRC Press.</ref> In July 1976, [[Associated Press]] reporter Wendy Walker reached out to Exidy based on her viewing of the game at a [[Seattle]] arcade. Concerned about the game's violent content and its potential effect on those playing it, she wrote a widely disseminated article which pointed out the game's content unfavorably.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Walker |first=Wendy |date=July 2, 1976 |title=It Offers That Run-Down Feeling |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/191227818/ |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> 

Following this article, many news organizations through 1976 and 1977 reported on ''Death Race'', including national newspapers like ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> Many at Exidy attribute a large jump in sales for the company to this increase in national profile for ''Death Race'', even though most of the coverage was negative. By the end of 1977 the game no longer graced headlines.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":4" />

==Reception==
In the United States, it was the eighth highest-grossing [[1976 in video games|arcade game of 1976]] according to ''RePlay'' magazine.<ref name="RePlay">{{cite magazine |title=Profit Chart |magazine=RePlay |date=October 1976}}</ref> It was later the seventh highest-grossing [[1977 in video games|arcade game of 1977]], according to ''[[Play Meter]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Top Arcade Games |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=November 1977}}</ref>

In 2016 Binary Star Software released a dual title cartridge called "Nox / Death Chase".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.binarystarsoftware.com/?p=345 |title=NEWS, RELEASES NOX/DEATH CHASE AND GALAXY WARS/SPACE LAUNCHER |publisher=Binary Star Software |date=2016-07-31 |accessdate=2016-10-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008233629/http://www.binarystarsoftware.com/?p=345 |archive-date=2016-10-08}}</ref> The release of "Death Chase" recreates the look, feel, and play of the 1970s ''Death Race'' on the 1980s [[Vectrex]] vector graphics home video game system.
