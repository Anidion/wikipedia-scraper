==Gameplay==
''LeMans'' is a single-player [[racing video game]] in which the player drives along a race track shown in top-down view. The player controls the car using a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a four-position [[gear stick]]. The objective is to drive against a [[time limit]] around a series of race tracks, while avoiding oil slicks and the walls. There are six tracks based on real world [[race track]]s ([[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]], [[Nürburgring]], [[Sebring International Raceway|Sebring]], [[WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]], [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] and [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]]) and four "mystery tracks", two of which will be chosen at random if the player manages to complete the first six tracks within the time limit.<ref name="ArchMus" />

In the United States, it was listed by ''[[Play Meter]]'' as the fourth highest-grossing [[1977 in video games|arcade game of 1977]],<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Top Arcade Games |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=November 1977}}</ref> and by ''RePlay'' as one of the year's top 35 arcade games.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Profit Chart |magazine=RePlay |date=November 1977}}</ref> It was later among America's top 30 highest-grossing [[1979 in video games|arcade video games of 1979]], according to ''[[Play Meter]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Winners of '79 |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |year=1979}}</ref>
