'''''F-1''''' is a 1976 [[Electro-mechanical games|electro-mechanical]] arcade [[racing game]] developed and published by [[Namco|Nakamura Manufacturing Company]] (Namco), and distributed in North America by [[Atari, Inc.]] The player uses a steering wheel to control a [[Formula One]] racer, which must avoid collision with other vehicles. The game uses a miniature diorama with small, plastic cars to represent the player's car and opponents on a physical, rotating track, while also featuring a projector system and lighting tricks to create the illusion of racing.

The game was designed by company engineer Sho Osugi, who worked on many of the company's earlier driving-themed electro-mechanical games, and was made to be a smaller version of his earlier game ''Formula-X'' that could easily be placed into smaller stores and entertainment centers. The 1968 electro-mechanical driving game ''Indy 500'' by Kansai Seiki Seisakusho (Kasco) is also believed to be a source of inspiration for the game, likely due to Namco's strong business relationship with Kansai prior to development.

''F-1'' was widely successful upon release, being praised for its sense of thrill, responsive controls and attractive cabinet design. It is cited as the first [[Formula One video games|game based on Formula One racing]] and one of Namco's first major arcade hits. It was the highest-grossing arcade game in Japan for two years in a row, [[1976 in video games|in 1976]] and [[1977 in video games|1977]], and the highest-grossing electro-mechanical arcade game of 1977 in the United States. It was followed by a sequel, '''''F-1 Mach''''' (1977). A cabinet appears in the film ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978). ''F-1'' later provided the basis for Namco's hit [[racing video game]] ''[[Pole Position]]'' (1982), which was co-designed by Sho Osugi.

The player sits in a cockpit-like [[arcade cabinet]], in front of a large projection screen. It projects realistic color visuals, including the front of the player's car, a roughly circular track, and two competing racing cars, and generates sound effects. When the player collides with another car, the game triggers a crash sequence, where an array of fire and smoke burst onto the screen.<ref name="PM1976"/>

==Development and release==
''F-1'' was designed by engineer Sho Osugi of the [[Namco|Nakamura Manufacturing Company]], who worked on many of the company's earlier driving-themed electro-mechanical arcade games.<ref name="Siliconera"/> The game is based on Osugi's previous racing games ''Racer'' (1973) and ''Formula-X'' (1975), the latter of which was only found in areas such as bowling alleys due to its massive cabinet size — this led to him producing a smaller version that could be fitted more easily into smaller stores and other entertainment centers.<ref name="Siliconera">{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Alistar |title=Chasing Down Memories Of Making Arcade Racers With Namco Veteran Sho Osugi |url=https://www.siliconera.com/2019/03/11/chasing-down-memories-of-making-arcade-racers-with-namco-veteran-sho-osugi/ |website=[[Siliconera]] |access-date=13 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827174922/https://www.siliconera.com/2019/03/11/chasing-down-memories-of-making-arcade-racers-with-namco-veteran-sho-osugi/ |archive-date=27 August 2019 |date=11 March 2019}}</ref> This smaller version was also made to be a drastic improvement over the original, featuring more realistic lighting effects and a more effective projector system.<ref name="Siliconera"/> The 1968 driving game ''Indy 500'' by Kansai Seiki Seisakusho (Kasco) is also believed to have been a possible source of inspiration for the game, due to Nakamura Manufacturing's strong business relationship with them.<ref name="Iwatani">{{cite book|last=Iwatani |first=Toru |title=Introduction to Pac-Man's Game Science |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |date=September 2005 |page=33}}</ref> ''F-1'' was released by Nakamura Manufacturing in October 1976 in Japan under the Namco branding.
