== Gameplay ==
The game's arcade cabinet contains a steering wheel, shifter, pedals, and other controls in the form of buttons.<ref name=":0" /> The player drives along a twisting roadway bordered by white guardrails.<ref name=":0" /> The lower portion of the screen shows the speedometer, mileage, and other indicators.<ref name=":0" /> The game counts crashes and punishes them with a time penalty.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://weltenschule.de/vgames/Nuerburg/Nuerburgring.html|title=Reiner Foerst's Nürburgring - The world first 3D arcade car race game, made in Germany!|last=(c)2000..2007|first=CYBERYOGI Christian Oliver(=CO=) Windler|website=weltenschule.de|access-date=2017-07-29}}</ref> It ends after 90 seconds or after driving across the finish line.<ref name=":1" />

== Development ==
The game was created by Dr. Foerst not out of a desire to develop a video game, but in order to make a working driving simulation.<ref name=":0" /> Unable to find a way to cheaply scale down the earliest driving simulators by [[Volkswagen]] and BP, he decided to build one based on the technology he found inside a ''[[Pong]]'' video game machine.<ref name=":0" /> The resulting arcade game has no CPU and contains 28 separate circuit boards.<ref name=":0" />

== Legacy ==
Dave Shepperd, a programmer at [[Atari, Inc.]], saw a picture of the arcade cabinet in a flyer that had a small portion of the screen visible, which inspired him to create ''[[Night Driver (video game)|Night Driver]]''.<ref name=":0" /> Atari was able to miniaturize the game to a single board and ultimately capitalized on ''Nürburgring 1'' while that game remained largely unknown.<ref name=":0" />

Several other versions of ''Nürburgring 1'' were created.<ref name=":0" /> The second installment in the series has motorcycle handlebars, while the third is in full color with selectable backgrounds.<ref name=":0" /> Other versions of the third game in the series have cabinets that swivel back and forth on a turntable, as well as bank back and forth.<ref name=":0" />
