The game is housed in a large custom square cabinet with two steering wheels and four pedals on each side. The monitor sits in the top of the cabinet. The game uses a full-color RGB display and does not use color overlays.

The cabinet also features overhead mirrors to allow spectators to watch the game while it's being played.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay is a simulation of an [[Indianapolis 500]] style of race, in which players compete by racing each other with simulated [[Indy Racing League|IndyCar]] race cars. The player cars' colors are light blue, green, red, and dark blue.
