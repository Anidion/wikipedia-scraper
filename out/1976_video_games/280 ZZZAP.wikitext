'''''280 ZZZAP''''' is a [[racing game|racing]] arcade video game designed by [[Jamie Fenton]] for [[Dave Nutting Associates]].

==Gameplay==
Players can drive up to {{convert|200|mph|km/h}} while navigating a tricky [[road course]] at night. Players must watch out for treacherous turns, nasty competitors, and the ever-present time limit.

==Release==
Midway demonstrated the game under the name ''Midnight Racer'' at the AMOA show in November 1976. It drew comparisons to ''[[Night Driver (video game)|Night Driver]]'', demonstrated at the same show by [[Atari, Inc.]]. Both games are derived from the earlier German night driving video game ''[[Nürburgring 1]]'' demonstrated at the German IMA show in Spring 1976.<ref name="PM1976">{{cite magazine |title=Sexton Star of MOA Seminar: Video |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=December 1976 |volume=2 |issue=14 |pages=20-26 (23-6) |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-2-number-14-december-1976-600DPI/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%202%2C%20Number%2014%20-%20December%201976/page/n20}}</ref> Before release in February 1977, the game was re-branded ''280 ZZZAP'' after the US advertising campaign for [[Nissan]]'s [[Datsun 280Z]].
