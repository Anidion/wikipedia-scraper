==Reception==
David Long reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Easy to learn and fast to play, ''GG'' is a great starter game for "arcaders" who've never tried a "wargame" before. But, much like chess, it will take a long time to really feel like you've mastered this game (I sure haven't!) and the possibilities are endless."<ref name="CGW6">{{cite magazine |last=Long |first=David |title=Galactic Gladiators: Individual Combat in the 28th Century |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September–October 1982 |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=20, 45}}</ref>

Chris Smith reviewed SSI's ''RapidFire Line'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 59, and commented that "The game has two very strong points: secret movement and freshness."<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last= Smith |first= Chris |date=January 1983 |title=SSI's RapidFire Line: Featured Review|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=59|pages=14–15}}</ref>
