'''''Pimania''''' is a text-and-graphics [[adventure game]] written by [[Mel Croucher]] and released by [[Automata UK]] in 1982 for  the [[BBC Micro]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Dragon 32]], and [[Sinclair ZX81]]. It was the first real-life video game [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure hunt]] to be released.<ref>{{cite book |date=2008|title=''Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008''|url= |location=Guinness World Records Ltd |publisher= |page=73 |isbn=978-1-904994-20-6|last1=Limited|first1=Guinness World Records}}</ref> It was inspired by the 1979 [[Kit Williams]] book ''[[Masquerade (book)|Masquerade]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_013_1982-11_EMAP_Publishing_GB/page/n83/mode/2up|title = Computer & Video Games - Issue 013 (1982-11)(EMAP Publishing)(GB)|date = November 1982}}</ref> Automata gave a prize of a golden sundial worth £6,000 ({{Inflation|UK|6000|1982|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=£}}) for the first person to solve the various cryptic clues to its location that were hidden within ''Pimania''. 

== Gameplay ==

[[File:Pimania screenshot (ZX81).png|thumb|left|ZX81 intro screen]]
The player negotiates a surreal landscape with the aid of the mysterious Pi-Man, Automata's mascot.<ref>[http://theconversation.com/how-punk-and-thatcherism-came-together-in-the-surreal-zx-spectrum-pimania-craze-74866 The Conversation: How punk and Thatcherism came together in the surreal ZX Spectrum Pimania craze]</ref> The [[B-side]] of the game cassette features a bizarre Pimania song played on a [[Casio VL-Tone|VL-Tone]] and vocals. The Pi-Man also starred in his own long-running, surreal, comic-strip, soap opera in the company's adverts on the back page of ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' magazine and appeared in several subsequent games by the company of different kinds, such as ''[[Piromania]]'' and ''[[Piballed]]''.

The sundial was eventually won in 1985 by Sue Cooper and Lizi Newman, who correctly worked out that it could only be found on 22 July (because [[pi|π]] is sometimes rounded to 22/7) at the [[Litlington White Horse]] on Hindover Hill near [[Litlington, East Sussex]].<ref name="cvg-198510">{{Cite journal|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=October 1985 |title=PiMania – The sundial is revealed! |url=https://worldofspectrum.org/hardware/piwin.html |journal=Computer and Video Games |access-date=21 November 2020}}</ref>

In 2010 Feeding Tube Records, a small label in the United States, released "Pimania: The Music of Mel Croucher & Automata U.K., Ltd.", a deluxe vinyl [[LP album]] of the musical B-Sides to the Pimania games, as well as tracks from other Automata releases. The album came with extensive liner notes by Croucher and Caroline Bren, as well as a large poster featuring selections from the original Automata print campaigns and was issued in a one time edition of 500 copies.<ref>[http://www.feedingtuberecords.com "Pimania: The Music of Mel Croucher & Automata U.K., Ltd."] LP on feedingtuberecords.com</ref>
