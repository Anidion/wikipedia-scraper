{{nihongo|'''''Tutankham'''''|ツタンカーム|Tsutankāmu}} is a 1982 [[arcade video game]] developed and released by [[Konami]]<ref name="CVG"/><ref name="Retro"/> and released by [[Stern (game company)|Stern]] in North America.<ref name="GM194">{{cite magazine|title=Overseas Readers Column - Konami And Stern Pact On "Tutankham" Video|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=194|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 August 1982|page=26|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19820815p.pdf}}</ref> Named after the Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]],<ref name="Retro"/> the game combines a [[List of maze video games|maze]] [[shoot 'em up]] with light [[Puzzle video game|puzzle-solving]] elements.<ref name="CVG"/><ref name="Weiss"/><ref name="Video"/> It debuted at the European [[Amusement Trades Exhibition International|ATE]] and IMA amusement shows in [[1982 in video games|January 1982]],<ref name="GM194"/><ref name="CVG"/> before releasing worldwide in Summer 1982. The game was a critical and commercial success and was ported to home systems by [[Parker Brothers]].

Armed with a [[laser weapon]] that only fires horizontally, the player loots the maze-like Egyptian [[tomb of Tutankhamun]] while finding keys to locked chambers and fighting off creatures. ''Tutankham'' is one of six games in a group photograph published in the January 1983 issue ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'' along with the record holder for each.  The ''Tutankham'' champion in the photo is Mark Robichek of [[Mountain View, California]].

==Gameplay==
Taking on the role of an explorer [[grave robbing]] the maze-like [[Tomb of Tutankhamun|tomb]] of Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]],<ref name="phosphor">{{cite web |url=http://www.thelogbook.com/phosphor/1983/tutankham-o2/ |title=Tutankham |date= |website=www.thelogbook.com |access-date=2017-03-09 |archive-date=2017-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312033350/http://www.thelogbook.com/phosphor/1983/tutankham-o2/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> the player is chased by [[Asp (reptile)|asps]], [[vultures]], [[parrots]], [[bat]]s, [[dragons]], and [[curse]]s, all of which kill the explorer on contact. The explorer wields a laser weapon that only fires left and right—there is no vertical offense—as well as a single screen-clearing "flash bomb" per level or life. Warp zones teleport the player to another location in the level, which enemies cannot use.

To progress, the player collects keys to open locked doors throughout each level and well as optional treasures for bonus points. The player can only carry one key at a time, so the game requires backtracking through an area in order to acquire a second key.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Tutankham |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tutankham/ |access-date=20 May 2021 |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> When a timer reaches zero the explorer can no longer shoot. Passing through the large exit door ends the level, and any remaining time is converted to bonus points.

Extra life is given at 30,000, and none more thereafter. The hero dies upon touching any enemy or spark. Play continues to the last hero dead, which ends the game.

==Ports==
''Tutankham'' was ported to home systems by [[Parker Brothers]], who advertised the game extensively in North America,<ref name="HG101"/><ref name="eg_16">{{cite magazine|title=Tutankham: The Home Video Game You've Waited 3000 Years For|magazine=[[Electronic Games]]|date=June 1983|volume=4|issue=16|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_16_1983-06_Reese_Communications_US/page/n10|page=11}}</ref> where it released in June 1983.<ref name="eg_16"/> It was ported to the [[Atari 2600]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Intellivision]], [[VIC-20]], [[PV-1000]], and [[PC-6001]].

Two tabletop versions of ''Tutankham'' were released: an [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] game in Japan and Europe from [[Bandai]] resembling an [[Arcade cabinet#Cocktail or table cabinets|cocktail arcade cabinet]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Bandai Tutankham (LCD) |url=https://www.handheldmuseum.com/Bandai/TutankhamLCD.htm |website=Handheld Museum}}</ref> and a [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] game from Bandai in Japan and Konami in North America.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bandai Tutankham (VFD) |url=https://handheldmuseum.com/Bandai/Tutankham.htm |website=Handheld Museum}}</ref>

The game received positive reviews from critics. ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine reviewed the arcade game in March 1982, following its debut at European amusement shows, giving it generally positive coverage.<ref name="CVG6">{{cite magazine |title=Explore This Oh-So Lengthy Tomb |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 March 1982 |issue=6 (April 1982) |page=27 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/163/445}}</ref> ''Joystik'' magazine also gave it a positive review, calling it a "beauty" in 1982.<ref name="Joystik">{{cite magazine |last1=Philips |first1=Scott |title=Video Debut: Report On The Amusement Operator's Exposition |url=https://archive.org/details/joystik_magazine-1982-09/page/n31/mode/2up |accessdate=18 February 2020 |magazine=Joystik |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=September 1982 |pages=30–31}}</ref> ''Computer and Video Games'' later praised the arcade game in November 1983, calling it the first game that effectively combined the elements of an adventure game with "frenetic" shoot 'em up gameplay. They gave the [[VIC-20]] port a positive review, calling it "a superb piece of software" amidst "the plethora of mediocre and poor quality titles being touted for this machine", but they criticized the VIC-20 cartridge's high UK price of {{£|29.95|long=no|1983|round=0}}. They rated the VIC-20 version (out of 10) 9 for getting started, 9 for graphics, 5 for value, and 9 for playability, for a total score of 32 out of 40.<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|title=Fine Time in Tombs of Tut!

Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz reviewed the Atari 2600 port in the Arcade Alley column of ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine in 1983, calling it "a superb translation" of the "coin-op oddity—an adventure game" for the 2600. They said "the play-action is fascinating" and invites "frequent replays" while praising the "wonderful blend of puzzle-solving and hand-eye challenge" as well as the "lush colors" and "Arabian-style score marker". They concluded that "''Tutankham'' is video game royalty".<ref name="Video">{{cite magazine |last1=Kunkel |first1=Bill |author-link1=Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2=Katz |first2=Arnie |author-link2=Arnie Katz|date=December 1983 |title=Arcade Alley: Super Gifts for Gamers |magazine=[[Video (magazine)|Video]] |publisher=Reese Communications |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=28–9 |issn=0147-8907|url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/articles/arcade_alley/arcade_alley_dec83.pdf}}</ref> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' magazine reviewed the ColecoVision port in 2014.

==Legacy==
''Tutankham'' is included in ''[[Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] (renamed to '''''Horror Maze''''').

According to ''Hardcore Gaming 101'', Konami's ''[[King's Valley]]'' (1985) is considered a spiritual successor to ''Tutankham'' in Japan. It keeps the theme of treasuring hunting in Egyptian tombs and has identical end-of-level music.<ref name="HG101"/>

===Influence===
''[[Time Bandit]]'' (1983), best known for its 1985 [[Atari ST]] version, was heavily inspired by ''Tutankham'' and had a working title of ''Pharaoh''. Both games also have similarities to the 1985 arcade hit ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'' by [[Atari Games]]. According to ''Time Bandit'' designer Harry Lafnear, both ''Time Bandit'' and ''Gauntlet'' have roots in earlier "maze shoot 'em up" games such as ''Tutankham''.<ref name="legend">{{cite web |title=Harry Lafnear Interview |url=https://www.atarilegend.com/interviews/interviews_detail.php?selected_interview_id=4 |website=Atari Legend |date=September 5, 2003}}</ref> Jack Palevich, designer of ''Gauntlet''{{'}}s main inspiration, ''[[Dandy (video game)|Dandy]]'' (1983), also mentioned being influenced by "half-forgotten" maze-exploration arcade games which contributed the idea of using keys to unlock doors.<ref name="Palevich">{{cite web |last=Palevich |first=Jack |url=https://jacks-hacks.appspot.com/dandy/history.html |title=A History of Dandy Dungeon |accessdate=2013-11-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104190048/http://jacks-hacks.appspot.com/dandy/history.html |archivedate=2013-11-04}}</ref> In 2008, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' magazine called ''Tutankham'' "an early ''Gauntlet''".<ref>{{cite magazine|date=August 2008|title=Developer Lookback: Konami Part I|url=https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_053#page/n27/mode/2up|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=53|page=29}}</ref>
