''Armor Assault'' is a tactical simulation of [[tank]] warfare in hypothetical World War III between [[NATO]] and the [[Soviet Union]], in a variety of scenarios from the Rhine to Afghanistan. Each side controls six tanks, armed with guided missiles and mines. The player can select from 12 scenarios and variety of terrain: jungle, desert, river, city and mountain ranges. Each turn player maneuvers his tanks, mines and guided missiles, destroying his foe's forces with opportunity and direct fire. Movement is affected by terrain and type of fire implemented.
