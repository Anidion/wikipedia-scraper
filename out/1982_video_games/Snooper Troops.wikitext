'''''Snooper Troops''''' is a series of two 1982 adventure/educational video games developed by [[Spinnaker Software]] and published by [[Computer Learning Connection]]. They were released for the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[MS-DOS]]. The first case was entitled '''''Snooper Troops: Case #1: The Granite Point Ghost''''' and the second case entitled '''''Snooper Troops: Case #2 - The Case of the Disappearing Dolphin''''' was released later that year.

==Plot==
In the first case, players have to solve the mystery of "The Granite Point Ghost", which has been scaring the Kim family out of their house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wCiNAUEuAMC&q=%22Snooper+Troops+%22&pg=PA14|title=PC Mag|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|date=February–April 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vy3cBZkjbZgC&q=%22Snooper+Troops+%22&pg=RA2-PA14|title=PC Mag|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|date=November 1982}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
In this "mystery simulation",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amFQAAAAYAAJ&q=%22Snooper+Troops+%22|title=Teaching and Computers|year=1983}}</ref> players use the SnoopNet computer to search for clues along the streets, and search in people's houses while they're not at home. If you are caught snooping too many times, the game is over. After gaining enough information, they can convict the criminal.

''[[InfoWorld]]'' described the game as an electronic version of the board game ''[[Cluedo|Clue]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ui8EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Snooper+Troops+%22&pg=PA57|title=InfoWorld|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|date=1983-08-15}}</ref>

''Snooper Troops'' was developed by Computer Learning Connection (later renamed Spinnaker Software), at that point a two-year-old company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vy3cBZkjbZgC&q=Cambridge%2C+Massachusetts+snooper+troops&pg=RA3-PA14|title=PC Mag|first=Ziff Davis|last=Inc|date=1 November 1982|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|via=Google Books}}</ref> The company was based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
