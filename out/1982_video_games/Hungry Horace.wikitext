'''''Hungry Horace''''' is a [[video game]] developed by Psion Software Ltd. and published by [[Sinclair Research]] in 1982 for [[Commodore 64]], [[Dragon 32/64]], [[Timex Sinclair 2068]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and later for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. It is the first game in the ''[[Horace (video game series)|Horace]]'' series. The gameplay is noted to be very similar to ''[[Pac-Man]],'' involving the collection of food pellets in a maze while avoiding enemies. Despite this, critical reception of the game was generally positive upon release.

The original Horace game, ''Hungry Horace'' was written as a simple ''[[Pac-Man]]'' clone,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/06/runit.htm |title=CRASH 6 – Run It Again |publisher=Crashonline.org.uk |date= |access-date=2011-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Escape! |url=https://archive.org/stream/popular-computing-weekly-1983-01-06/PopularComputing_Weekly_Issue_1983-01-06#page/n11/mode/2up |work=Popular Computing Weekly |issue=1983–01–06}}</ref> published in 1982. In it, Horace must gather food from around a park and move onto the next section while avoiding park guards. It is possible for him to collect a bell to panic the guards and render them vulnerable, like the power pills in ''Pac-Man''. This title was available on the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Dragon 32]]. The ZX Spectrum original was marketed and distributed by Sinclair themselves, the Commodore 64 and Dragon 32 versions by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]].

The Commodore 64 version also included a level editor which allowed the game owner to create, edit and save to cassette tape their own levels of the game. These could be shared with other owners of the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

A DOS-hosted level editor was written for the ZX Spectrum version in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://groups.google.co.uk/group/comp.sys.sinclair/browse_thread/thread/92c2e9c14c2db7ca/42c7c925379aece9 |title=HHEDIT release announcement on Usenet |date= |access-date=2011-02-06 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Reception==
Dick Olney for ''[[Personal Computer World]]'' said "The graphics are excellent, and there are some interesting, if rather limited, sound effects."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerWorld1983-01/page/112/mode/2up|title=Personal Computer World (1983-01)|date=January 10, 1983|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said "Horace is one of the stars of computer games. like Miner Willy, Cuthbert, and the Pi-Man, his latest games are looked forward to in the same way as the next instalment of the ''Star Wars'' or ''Rocky'' sagas."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_0033a/page/44/mode/2up|title=Computer and Video Games Issue 0033a|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

David Brudenall for ''[[Your Computer (Australian magazine)|Your Computer]]'' said "all things considered, it's a marvellous little game, especially for the graphics, and would be especially good for young children."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/yc_1984_09/page/150/mode/2up|title=Your Computer (Australian) 1984 September|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
