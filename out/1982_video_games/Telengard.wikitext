'''''Telengard''''' is a 1982 [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[dungeon crawler]] video game developed by Daniel Lawrence and published by [[Avalon Hill]]. The player explores a dungeon, fights monsters with magic, and avoids traps in [[Real-time simulation|real-time]] without any set mission other than surviving. Lawrence first wrote the game as ''[[DND (video game)|DND]]'', a 1976 version of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' for the [[DECsystem-10]] [[mainframe computer]]. He continued to develop ''DND'' at [[Purdue University]] as a hobby, rewrote the game for the [[Commodore PET 2001]] after 1978, and [[Porting of video games|ported]] it to [[Apple II+]], [[TRS-80]], and [[Atari 800]] before Avalon Hill found the game at a convention and licensed it for distribution. Its [[Commodore 64]] release was the most popular. Reviewers noted ''Telengard''{{'}}s similarity to ''Dungeons and Dragons''. RPG historian Shannon Appelcline noted the game as one of the first professionally produced computer role-playing games, and ''[[Gamasutra]]''{{'}}s Barton considered ''Telengard'' consequential in what he deemed "The Silver Age" of computer role-playing games preceding the [[golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of the late 1980s. Some of the game's dungeon features, such as altars, fountains, teleportation cubes, and thrones, were adopted by later games such as ''[[Tunnels of Doom]]'' (1982).

== Gameplay ==
[[File:800px-Telengard Screen Shot2.jpg|thumb|225px|left|A player navigates the dungeon in the IBM version.]]

In ''Telengard'', the player travels alone through a dungeon fraught with monsters, traps, and treasures in a manner similar to the original ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.<ref name=AllGame/> The game has 50 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] with two million rooms, 20 monster types, and 36 spells.{{efn|The game's program allows an exception to go below level 50, with a gamer in 2021 reaching level 9,949 before being defeated by a level 27940 Ogre.<ref name=Igor/>}} It has no missions or quests, and its only objective is to survive and improve the [[player character]].<ref name="Gamasutra HCRPG"/> The game is set in [[Real-time simulation|real-time]] and cannot be paused,<ref name="Gamasutra HCRPG"/> so the player must visit an inn to save game progress. In the early releases such as [[Apple II]], the [[Virtual world|game world]] has no sound and is represented by [[ASCII]] characters, such as [[Slash (punctuation)#Computing|slashes]] for stairs and [[Dollar sign#Use in computer software|dollar signs]] for treasure.<ref name=AllGame/> Unless the player enters a special [[Cheating in video games|cheat code]], [[permadeath|progress is lost upon dying]].<ref name=AllGame/>

The single-player adventure begins by personalizing a player character. Each character has randomly generated values for their [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistical character attributes]]: charisma, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength, and wisdom.{{efn|Charisma changes how enemies respond to the player's presence. Constitution determines the degree of damage taken in battle. Dexterity is a measure of ability to evade when in battle. Intelligence affects magical spell ability. Strength affects combat ability. Wisdom lets the player use healing and undead spells.<ref name=Compute/>}} The algorithm never changes, but the player can randomize repeatedly for new character attribute distributions until satisfied. The player begins with a sword, armor, shield, and no money, and can only see the immediate surroundings, rather than the whole level.<ref name="CGW p35"/>

Monsters spawn randomly, and players have three options in battle: fight, use magic, or evade. Magic includes combative missiles, fireballs, lightning bolts, [[Undead#Games|turning the undead]], [[Health (gaming)#Recharging health|health regeneration]], and trap navigation. The effects of the game's most complex spells are not outlined in the instruction manual and must be learned by trial and error. Like the game, the battle events are carried out in real-time instead of in turns.<ref name="CGW p43"/> Enemies increase in difficulty as the player progresses through the dungeon.<ref name=AllGame/> They include both living and undead monsters such as elves, dragons, mummies, and wraiths. Defeating enemies awards [[experience points]], which accrete to raise the player's experience level and increase player stats.<ref name=Compute/> The player is rewarded with treasures that include magical weapons, armor items, and potions. Players can code their own features into the game.<ref name="CGW p43"/>

== Development ==
While a [[computer science]] student at [[Purdue University]], Daniel Lawrence wrote several games for the university's [[PDP-11]] [[RSTS/E]] [[mainframe computer]], and one grew into ''Telengard''.<ref name="Lawrence: About"/> In his 1976/77 college summer breaks at home, he worked at [[Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (New York)|BOCES]] in [[Spencerport, New York]], where he wrote a [[dungeon crawl]] game called ''[[DND (video game)|DND]]'' (postdating the similar but unrelated ''[[Dnd (1974 video game)|dnd]]'') in the [[BASIC]] programming language for the [[DECsystem-10]]'s [[TOPS-10]] operating system.<ref name="Lawrence: Telengard"/><ref name="designers">{{Cite book | author=Shannon Appelcline | title=Designers & Dragons | publisher=Mongoose Publishing | year=2011 | isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7 | pages=20,176}}</ref> He had been influenced by the [[Pen-and-paper role-playing game|pen and paper]] role-playing game ''Dungeons & Dragons''.<ref name=Armchair/> At college, he [[Porting of video games|ported]] the game to Purdue's PDP-11 RSTS/E.<ref name="Lawrence: Telengard"/>{{efn|He was later asked by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] to port ''DND'' to [[DECsystem-20]].<ref name="Lawrence: Telengard"/>}} The game's mechanics grew from conversations at the Purdue engineering building. Part of its [[Real-time simulation|real-time]] nature descended from the need to not have players monopolize the few shared computer terminals.<ref name=Armchair/>

In 1978, Lawrence purchased the [[Commodore PET 2001|PET 2001]] and no longer needed the university's computer, though the microcomputer's lack of memory was his primary design obstacle.<ref name=Armchair/> He rewrote ''DND'' as ''Telengard'' within eight kilobytes of memory<ref name="Lawrence: Telengard"/> and designed the dungeon to be [[procedurally generated]] based on the player-character's position so the [[Level (video gaming)|maps]] would not have to be stored in memory. The final version almost completely used 32 kilobytes of memory. It was easily ported to the [[Apple II+]] and [[TRS-80]] platforms due to their similar usage of the 8K BASIC programming language. The port to [[Atari 8-bit computers]] required more complicated handling of [[string (computer science)|string variables]].<ref name="Lawrence: Telengard"/> Movement is by [[WASD keys]], perhaps the first video game to use them.<ref name="harbron20201029">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLGkqpPZ60c |title=Time Machine? Or VIC-20 24KB RAM 7 Cartridge Expander? |date=2020-10-29 |last=Harbron |first=Robin |type=YouTube |publisher=8-Bit Show and Tell}}</ref>

The three ports were finished before [[Avalon Hill]] saw the game at a gaming convention and licensed it in 1982 as one of its first computer games.<ref name=Armchair/> The IBM PC port required a rewrite into the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]]; the [[source code]] for this version was later lost.<ref name="Lawrence: Telengard"/> The [[Zenith Data Systems|Heath/Zenith]] [[CP/M]] version requires [[MBASIC]].<ref name="loguidice20120725">{{cite web | url=http://www.armchairarcade.com/neo/node/4827 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119142009/http://www.armchairarcade.com/neo/node/4827 | archive-date=2016-11-19 | title=Avalon Hill's Telengard for Z-90 or H/Z-100 with CP/M-85 and MBASIC: A casual tale of making it work in photos and videos | publisher=Armchair Arcade | date=2012-07-25 | access-date=22 July 2015 | author=Loguidice, Bill}}</ref> The [[VIC-20]] version requires 24K memory expansion.{{r|harbron20201029}} The [[Commodore 64]] port was the most popular.<ref name="Gamasutra HCRPG"/>

Matt Barton of ''[[Gamasutra]]'' reported that Lawrence's ''DND'' (and consequently, his ''Telengard'') was directly inspired by Whisenhunt and Wood's ''[[dnd (video game)|dnd]]'' for [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]], with its randomized dungeons and minimalist graphics,<ref name="Gamasutra HCRPG"/> though Lawrence recalled in an interview that he had not seen or known of their game.<ref name=Armchair/> ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] wrote that ''Telengard'' was based on the earlier, [[public domain software]] ''Castle Telengard''.<ref name="CGW 38"/>

The game's [[BASIC]] [[source code]] was available, so ports and [[Video game remake|remasters]] were made by the fan community.<ref>[http://atarihq.com/danb/Telengard.shtml Telengard] on atarihq.com</ref><ref>[http://atarihq.com/danb/files/TelengardListing.pdf TelengardListing.pdf] commented listing on atarihq.com</ref><ref>[http://csdb.dk/release/?id=145661 Telengard Remaster 1.1] on the C-64 scene database (2016)</ref>

== Reception and legacy ==
Norman Banduch provided an early review for ''Telengard'' in the December 1982 issue of ''[[The Space Gamer]]'',<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Banduch |first=Norman |date=December 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=58|pages=46, 48}}</ref> saying that "''Telengard'' could have been a good game, but is marred by poor programming and lack of polish. If you don't want to rewrite it yourself, wait for the second edition".<ref name="SG"/>

RPG historian Shannon Appelcline identifies ''Telengard'' as one of the first professionally produced [[computer role-playing games]].<ref name="designers"/> ''Gamasutra''{{'}}s Barton described the game as a "pure dungeon crawler" for its lack of diversions, and noted its expansive dungeons as a "key selling point".<ref name="Gamasutra HCRPG"/> [[AllGame]]'s Earl Green remarked that the game's mechanics were very similar in practice to ''Dungeons & Dragons'',<ref name=AllGame/> ''The Commodore 64 Home Companion'' described it to have ''Dungeons-and-Dragons'' style,<ref name=C64HC>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/The_Commodore_64_Home_Companion#page/n167/mode/2up|title=Avalon Hill Game Company|work=The Commodore 64 Home Companion|year=1984|access-date=August 19, 2016|page=166}}</ref> ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s Dick McGrath also said the game "borrowed heavily" from the original such that he expected its creators to be thanked in the [[end credits]],<ref name="CGW p35"/> and Scorpia cited four specific similarities with ''Dungeons & Dragons''.{{r|scorpia199310}}

Green described the game as "exceedingly simple ... yet very addictive" and rated it four of five stars.<ref name=AllGame/> McGrath wrote that he wanted to have more control over his money, and added that a store for purchasing upgrades would have been useful. He thought that games such as ''[[Dunjonquest]]'' and ''Maces and Magic'' handled this aspect better. McGrath suggested that the player draw their own map in the absence of an overview mapping system.<ref name="CGW p35"/> He said that his appreciation for the game grew with time and that it had the necessary hook to make him continually return and play again.<ref name="CGW p43"/> Tony Roberts of ''[[Compute!]]'' considered the Commodore 64 version of the game best for its enhanced graphics.<ref name=Compute/> ''The Commodore 64 Home Companion'' agreed, stating that it "has some fine sprite graphics and sound effects not found in other versions of the game".{{r|C64HC}} Scorpia in 1993 stated that while ''Telengard'' was "interesting for its time, the game would be pretty dated today" compared to the [[Gold Box]] games; "back then, however, it was hot stuff, and a fun way of passing the time".{{r|scorpia199310}}

Barton of ''Gamasutra'' placed ''Telengard'' alongside ''[[Wizardry]]'' and the [[Ultima (series)#The Age of Darkness: Ultima I–III|early ''Ultima'' series]] in what he deemed "The Silver Age" of computer role-playing games that preceded the [[golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of the late 1980s.<ref name="Gamasutra HCRPG"/> Yet in 1992, ''Computer Gaming World''{{'s}} Gerald Graef wrote that ''Telengard'' and ''[[Temple of Apshai]]'' were "quickly overshadowed" by the ''Wizardry'' and ''Ultima'' series.<ref name="CGW 92"/>{{efn|''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s Roy Wagner wrote that ''Telengard'' and ''Temple of Apshai'' were "very similar".<ref name="CGW 4.3"/>}} Some of the game's dungeon features, such as altars, fountains, teleportation cubes, and thrones, were adopted by later games such as ''[[Tunnels of Doom]]'' (1982), and ''[[Sword of Fargoal]]'' (1982) has similar features. Barton wrote in 2007 that ''Telengard'' "still enjoys considerable appreciation today" and questioned whether the [[Diablo (series)|''Diablo'' series]] was "but an updated ''Telengard''".<ref name="Gamasutra HCRPG"/>
