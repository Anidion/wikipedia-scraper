'''''Ladder''''' is a [[platform game]] similar to Nintendo's ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' written for the [[CP/M|CP/M operating system]] and made to be operated on the early [[Kaypro]] line of luggable computers. ''Ladder'' was written by [[Yahoo Software]] of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=BAM Publications|year=1985|volume=2|series=MicroTimes|pages=48â€“49}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=InfoWorld|date=October 1983|volume=5|issue=44|pages=109|title=Review: Kaypro 10|url={{Google books|id=2y8EAAAAMBAJ|page=109|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref> Along with ''[[Star Trek (1971 video game)|Star Trek]]'', ''[[CatChum]]'' and ''[[Aliens (1982 video game)|Aliens]]'', ''Ladder'' was one of the games that came with the software bundle of the early [[Kaypro]] computers.

==Gameplay==
Since the Kaypro only has a text mode, the game uses letters, numbers, and symbols lined up to create walls and platforms, pits/traps, characters, trampolines and goals. The floors in ''Ladder'' are made of equal signs, and the ladders themselves are made of capital "H"s stacked on top of each other. The "lad" controlled by the player starts out as the letter "P" (lowercase "q" on left), the treasure is the dollar sign "[[$]]" and the ampersand "[[&]]", and barrels ("der rocks") are represented by "o"s.

The catchphrase of the game reminded the acolyte player that there are more ways than one to skin a cat. This referred to the fact that the minimized traverse of almost all levels could be enhanced by inventive utilisation of the game features, and the highest levels absolutely required it. These could entail (at the apex of the game) for instance jumping on a trampoline at precisely the right speed and point of impact to fall into one of the pit/traps, at the right timing that there would be no barrels passing for a sufficient interval.
