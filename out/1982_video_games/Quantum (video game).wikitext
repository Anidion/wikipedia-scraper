'''''Quantum''''' is a color [[Vector game|vector]] arcade video game developed at [[General Computer Corporation]] for [[Atari, Inc.]] and released in November 1982.<ref name="Atari24">{{cite book |title=Product: Total Build |url=http://www.atarigames.com/atarinumbers90s.pdf |publisher=[[Atari Games]] |year=1999 |access-date=March 2, 2021 |url-status=dead |archivedate=May 10, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510143012/www.atarigames.com/atarinumbers90s.pdf}}</ref> It was designed by Betty Ryan ({{nee|Tylko}}) who was the first female developer at GCC.<ref name=aw>{{cite web |title=Betty Ryan |url=http://www.atariwomen.org/stories/betty-ryan-tylko/ |website=Atari Women|date=13 May 2019 }}</ref> The premise of the game is related loosely to quantum physics; the player directs a probe with a [[trackball]] to encircle atomic "particles" for points, without touching various other particles. Once the particles are  surrounded by the probe's tail they are destroyed.

To enter initials for a high score, the player uses the trackball to circle letters in the same fashion used during gameplay. If the player achieves the highest score on the table, the initials screen is preceded by another on which adept players can use the trackball to draw their initials.
