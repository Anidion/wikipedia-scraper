'''''Wabbit''''' is a 1982 video game by [[Games by Apollo|Apollo]] for the [[Atari 2600]]. The game is reported to be the "first console game with a named playable female character who isn't off-screen".<ref name="Polygon">{{Cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|date=2021-02-11|title=In the '80s, she was a video game pioneer.

==Gameplay==

Wabbit is a farming simulation game with elements of the shoot 'em up genre in which the player controls a female character named "Billie Sue".<ref name="Polygon" /> Rabbits have descended upon Sue's farm and are quickly devouring her crop of carrots. In order to ward off the rabbits, the player must throw rotten eggs at them before they are able to carry away Sue's carrots.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Wabbit for Atari 2600 - GameFAQs|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/atari2600/585254-wabbit|access-date=2021-02-13|website=gamefaqs.gamespot.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Santulli|first=Joe|date=November 1992|title=Psychopedia - Part A|work=Digital Press|url=https://www.digitpress.com/library/newsletters/digitalpress/dp8.pdf|access-date=February 12, 2021}}</ref> The player scores points by hitting rabbits, and the rabbits score points by carrying carrots off-screen.

==Development==
In the early 1980s, Apollo received a number of letters from fans suggesting potential games they could develop.<ref name= "Oliver">{{Cite web|last=Oliver|first=Dan|date=May 24, 2013|title=Is Laser Gates really Inner Space?|url=https://atariage.com/forums/topic/169826-is-laser-gates-really-inner-space/page/7/?tab=comments#comment-2760433|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 12, 2021|website=AtariAge}}</ref> Coincidentally, two such letters simultaneously proposed the idea of having a farmer defend a farm from rabbits. Apollo had recently hired Van Mai (then Van Tran), a programmer originally from Vietnam who had done work with computer graphics for the Dallas Independent School District but was new to the video games industry. While the letters had the player assume the role of a male protagonist, she proposed creating a game aimed at girls featuring a female character instead, named Billie Sue. The proposal was accepted, and Tran designed and created the game as the sole developer on the project. Development took four to six months. It was showcased at the Texas State Fair in October 1982 around the time of release.<ref name="VanTranInterview"/>

==Reception==
Video game historian Kevin Bunch describes ''Wabbit'' as "colorful" and "probably one of the best games [Apollo] put out."<ref name="Polygon" /> One modern critic likewise praised the game's graphics as "refreshing" for its time, though criticizing the gameplay as frustrating, particularly as the speed of the rabbits increased.<ref name="Videogame critic" />

==Legacy==
The game is reported to be the "first console game with a named playable female character who isn't off-screen".

For decades, efforts have been made to contact the programmer, whose name was reported by former coworkers as "Ban Tran". Her actual name was discovered in 2022, and she was interviewed by the Video Game History Foundation in the following May.<ref name="VanTranInterview">{{Cite web |last1=Bunch |first1=Kevin |last2=Willaert |first2=Kate |date=May 13, 2022 |title=Pioneer Rediscovered: The Woman Who Brought Female Representation To Games: The year-long search for Van Mai comes to a happy conclusion. |url=https://gamehistory.org/wabbit |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=May 13, 2022 |website=GameHistory}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/23070918/van-tran-mai-video-game-history-atari-2600-wabbit  | title = A female video game pioneer was lost to history â€” until now | first = Nicole | last = Carpenter | date = May 13, 2022 | accessdate = May 13, 2022 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> ''Wabbit'' was the only game Tran developed for Apollo, as the company declared bankruptcy in November 1982; she later worked on a port of ''[[Solar Fox]]'' for the Atari 5200 for MicroGraphic Image, before leaving the video game industry.<ref name="VanTranInterview"/>
