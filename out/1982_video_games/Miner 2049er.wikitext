'''''Miner 2049er''''' is a [[platform game]] developed for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] by Bill Hogue and released by his company, [[Big Five Software]], in 1982. The player controls Bounty Bob through multiple levels of a mine, with the goal of traversing all of the platforms while avoiding or defeating enemy mutants. At a time when "climbing games" such as ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' had four screens, ''Miner 2049er'' had ten.

The game was Hogue's first for the Atari 8-bit line, and his first in color, following a string of games for the black-and-white [[TRS-80]]. It shipped on a custom 16 [[kilobyte]] [[ROM cartridge]] compared to the standard 8 kilobyte Atari computer cartridges. The game was ported to the [[TI-99/4A]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[VIC-20]] computers as well the [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[ColecoVision]], and [[Super Cassette Vision]] consoles. The Atari 2600 version was split into two separate releases, each containing three levels.

''Miner 2049er'' received positive press throughout 1983, appearing on best-of lists, with critics complimenting its colors, game design, and originality. The game influenced other [[platform game]]s of the 1980s, such as ''[[Manic Miner]]''. ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine's editors commented on the game's popularity in January 1984, declaring it "the most widely played home electronic game of all time" and that "no home-arcade title has had the impact" that ''Miner 2049er'' had.{{sfn|Kunkel|Katz|1984}} While the game received positive reviews in retrospectives from [[IGN]] and [[AllGame]], Richard Stanton, in his book ''A Brief History of Video Games'' (2015), stated that ''Miner 2049er'' ended up mostly forgotten in the wake of  ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985).

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Miner2049er-Atari800-gameplay.gif|thumb|left|The first level. Each piece of the floor changes as Bob walks over it.]]

''Miner 2049er'' features Bounty Bob, who has chased an evil miner into a series of uranium mines. To complete a stage, Bob must survey the mine by moving left and right across every part of the floor of each level. The levels are full of hazards, including gaps in platforms, slides, radioactive waste, and mutants. The mutants can kill Bob by touching him, but they can be defeated if Bob collects prospecting gear, such as candles and drills, and then touches the mutants.{{sfn|Buchanan|2007}} Other game elements include lifts, cannons, and transporters, which can rapidly move Bob to different parts of the screen.{{sfn|Big Five Software||ref=manual}}

The original and Atari 5200 versions of the game have ten levels, but this varies in the ports. The Atari 2600 version has three (and there is a ''Volume II'' cartridge with three more), ColecoVision has eleven, and the TI-99/4A has eight.<ref name="Atr481200" /><ref name="TI-rev">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update includes Computer Entertainer]]|volume=2|issue=10|date=January 1984|title=Critically Speaking..Apple-Compatible|page=155}}</ref><ref name="atr5200" />

==Development==
''Miner 2049er'' was programmed by Bill Hogue of Big Five Software of Van Nuys, California.{{sfn|Boaz|1983|p=20}}<ref name="Atari50-1">{{cite video game |title=Atari 50 |developer=[[Digital Eclipse]] |publisher=[[Atari SA|Atari]] |date=November 11, 2022 |platform=Nintendo Switch |quote='''The Dawn of PCs: Miner 2049er''': Another breakout hit for the 400/800 computers, Miner 2049er was a platform game created by Bill Hogue, which he published through his company Big Five Software.

He recollected that "I was never very good at ''Pac-Man'', so I'm not sure why I borrowed any elements from the game."{{sfn|Grannell|2007|p=37}} The gameplay was developed first, followed later by the mining theme and narrative.{{sfn|Grannell|2007|p=37}}  Some versions of the game feature the song "[[Oh My Darling, Clementine|Clementine]]" while others do not.<ref name="Atr481200" /><ref name="atr5200" />

Mike Livesay designed the adaptations of the game for the Apple II computer and for [[Colecovision]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update includes Computer Entertainer]]|volume=2|issue=11|date=February 1984|title=Update on Scraper Caper|page=172}}</ref> Livesay initially approached Micro Fun about adapting the game for Colecovision but was turned down by the company, which stated that they did not want third-party games. Despite this, Livesay reverse-engineered the Colecovision and developed his own kit for it based on the [[Apple II]]. Livesay eventually got Micro Fun to agree to do the Colecovision version of the game, allowing him time to make more levels for it. He later recalled that "six months later I was making $15,000 a month in royalties, which was a huge amount for a single, 24-year-old kid in the early '80s."{{sfn|Weiss|2014|p=139}}

[[Tom Hudson (programmer)|Tom Hudson]] in ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' had trouble believing that the game fit on a 16K cartridge and said that it was "one of those rare games which looks as if it were designed, not just thrown together." He noted that the mine and Bob weren't "just one-color graphics, but detailed multicolor objects" and that "the game itself was not abandoned in favor of graphics".{{sfn|Hudson|1982|p=14}} Boaz declared the game to be a "gourmet's delight that offers many, many levels of challenge" and applied "skillful use of colors" with its randomly generated palettes that broke up the monotony.{{sfn|Boaz|1983|p=20}} A reviewer credited as "MTY" in the magazine ''[[Softalk|Softline]]'' found that despite being similar to ''Donkey Kong'', ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and ''[[Apple Panic]]'', the game was original and that "unlike many arcade games, ''Miner'' doesn't require you to get faster as the pace picks up in order to attain the next level. It requires you to develop the different skills needed to survive."{{sfn|MTY|1983|p=36}}

''Computer Entertainer'' declared Bill Hogue the designer of the year in their 1983 awards listing.<ref name="1983Awards" /> ''Miner 2049er'' was awarded "1984 Electronic [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]]" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]].{{sfn|Kunkel|Katz|1984}} Scott Mace listed it as the "best arcade-type computer game" of 1983. ''InfoWorld'' praised its unique gameplay elements, action, and humor, saying that "you won't find anything like Miner in the arcades. That in itself is cause for celebration."  It noted that in a year of "endless adaptation of arcade games, some good, most bad", that the game {{"'}}out-donkey-kongs' ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''".{{sfn|Mace|1983|p=55}} 

Reviewing the [[VIC-20]] version, [[Computer Entertainer|''The Video Game Update'']] found the game "addictive" with graphics that were "less than outstanding", but said that "there are enough challenges in this game to keep the player busy for many, many hours of frustration and triumph."<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Video Game Update|volume=2|issue=2|date=May 1983|title=Critically Speaking. . . VIC 20}}</ref> The magazine also reviewed the Atari 2600 version, noting that the limitations of the Atari 2600 system meant that the graphics were "sacrificed somewhat" and the game was "considerably slower and less fluid than in the original computer game, but this version is still a very good game in its own right."<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Video Game Update|volume=2|issue=2|date=June 1983|title=Critically Speaking..Atari 2600-Compatible|page=34}}</ref> The publisher declared the Intellivision version to be the "best climbing game yet" for the system.<ref name="Atr481200" />

In retrospective reviews, ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the Colecovision version an 82% rating in 1989, recommending it for fans of traditional platform games as one of the best on the system.<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |title=Complete Games Guide |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=October 16, 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |page=61 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf|accessdate=June 10, 2023|location=United Kingdom}}</ref> Brett Alan Weiss reviewed the Atari 5200 version, declaring it "one of the best games of the early 1980s", noting that it was fast-paced, intricately designed, and a very long and diverse game. He said that unlike those in ''Donkey Kong'', pathways were not immediately obvious, and this made the game fun and more challenging.{{sfn|Weiss}} Levi Buchanan of [[IGN]] declared the mobile version to be "a pixel-perfect recreation of the original", finding the controls responsive for a mobile game.{{sfn|Buchanan|2007}} He found that the game was fun in 1984 and was also fun in 2007, and that the game merited a new audience. He recommended it for fans of games like ''Donkey Kong'' and ''[[BurgerTime]]''.{{sfn|Buchanan|2007}} The mobile version was later released for [[iOS]].{{sfn|Patterson|2011}}
