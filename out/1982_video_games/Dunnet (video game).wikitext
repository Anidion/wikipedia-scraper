Dead end
You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
from each other.
There is a shovel here.

The game has been recommended to writers considering writing [[interactive fiction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getmewriting.com/interactive-fiction/intro-to-interactive-fiction/|title=Interactive Fiction â€“ An introduction (updated)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823022821/http://www.getmewriting.com/interactive-fiction/intro-to-interactive-fiction/|archive-date=2015-08-23}}</ref>

==Plot==
The game starts out with the player standing at the end of a dirt road, but it turns to the surreal when players realize that they are actually walking around inside a [[Unix]] system, and [[telnet|teleporting]] themselves around the [[Arpanet]]. There are many subtle jokes in this game, and there are multiple ways of ending the game. Throughout the game the player moves through different areas and rooms trying to collect treasure to earn points.

==Legacy==
Dunnet is playable on any operating system with the Emacs editor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ig3zbeoqfv4v1xl8|title=Dunnet|quote=A text adventure that is built into almost every copy of the Emacs text editor.}}</ref> Emacs comes with most [[Unices]], including [[macOS]] (prior to  version 10.15 [[MacOS Catalina|Catalina]])<ref>{{Cite web|title=EmacsForMacOS|url=https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS#h5o-1|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-16|website=EmacsWiki|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022140441/http://www.emacswiki.org:80/emacs/EmacsForMacOS |archive-date=2008-10-22 }}</ref> and distributions of [[Linux]]. Several articles targeted to Mac OS X owners have recommended it as an [[easter egg]] as a game that can be run in [[Terminal.app]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1047210/oldschooladventure.html|title=Play an 'old-school' adventure game}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5994581/discover-the-text-based-adventure-game-built-into-your-macs-terminal|title=Discover the Text-Based Adventure Game Built Into Your Mac's Terminal|date=14 April 2013 }}</ref> It can be run by running <code>emacs -batch -l dunnet</code> in a [[shell (computing)|shell]] or the key sequence <code>M-x dunnet</code> within Emacs, the former being the preferred and official way to run it.<ref>Dunnet help command: "NOTE: This game *should* be run in batch mode!"</ref> Dunnet was used as a [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] in the effort to port [[Emacs Lisp]] to [[GNU Guile|Guile]], progressing from running standalone games<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.slashdot.org/story/12/04/02/197221/guile-scheme-emacs-lisp-compatibility-matures|title=Guile Scheme Emacs-Lisp Compatibility Matures|date=2 April 2012 }}</ref> to running the entire Emacs system in less than a person-year of work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/615353/|title=Re: Emacs Lisp's future }}</ref>
