'''''Great Britain Ltd''''' (also known as '''''GBLtd''''') is a British [[nation-simulation game]] originally released in 1982 for the [[BBC Micro]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. The game was written and published by Simon W Hessel.

The game provides a simple [[government simulation]], allowing the player to manage the British economy and compete in [[election]]s every 5 years.  The player takes on the role of leader of one of the major parties, managing variables such as tax rates and welfare payments, which each year results in changes to key [[economic]] indicators such as [[inflation]] and [[unemployment]].

These changes also impact the player's popularity, making it easier or harder to win subsequent elections.  After winning an election, the player is allowed another 5 years to manage the economy before another election is held.
