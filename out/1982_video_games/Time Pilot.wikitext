Home ports for the [[Atari 2600]], [[MSX]], and [[ColecoVision]] were released in 1983.

A top-down sequel, ''[[Time Pilot '84]]'', was released in arcades in 1984. It drops the time travel motif and instead takes place over a futuristic landscape.

==Gameplay==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Players assume the role of a [[aircraft pilot|pilot]] of a futuristic [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] [[jet aircraft|jet]] trying to rescue fellow pilots trapped in different time eras. In each level, players battle enemy aircraft and then a stronger aircraft. Players' fighter jet is in the center of the screen at all times. Players eventually battle a mothership of the time period they are in; once the mothership is defeated, they move onto the next time period. Parachuting pilots will occasionally appear and award players points if collected.

There are five levels: 1910, 1940, 1970, 1982/1983{{efn|As this level represents what was then the present day, all releases of ''Time Pilot'' produced after 1982 contain an updated version of the game that changes the year to 1983.}} and 2001. After the fifth level is finished, the game repeats thereafter.

Extra lives are given at 10,000 points, and per 50,000 scored up to 960,000; thereafter, the game goes to "survival of the fittest" mode.

Fighters are destroyed if they collide into bullets, enemy ships, or missiles. Game ends if the last fighter is destroyed.

==Development==
According to his account, Yoshiki Okamoto's proposal for ''Time Pilot'' was initially rejected by his boss at Konami, who assigned Okamoto to work on a driving game instead. Okamoto secretly gave instructions to his programmer to work on his idea, while pretending to be working on a driving game in front of his boss.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videogames.com/features/universal/okamoto/oktime.html |title=VideoGameSpot's Interview with Yoshiki Okamoto|last=Kent|first=Steven |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981207033331/http://www.videogames.com/features/universal/okamoto/oktime.html |archive-date=December 7, 1998}}</ref>
