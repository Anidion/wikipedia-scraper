'''''Phaser Patrol''''', written by Dennis Caswell,<ref name="giantlist"/> is the first numbered release by Arcadia for the [[Atari 2600]] and the [[pack-in game]] for the Atari 2600 Supercharger accessory in 1982. The company changed its name to [[Starpath]] after launch, and the hardware was rebranded the [[Starpath Supercharger]].

The game simulates space combat in which the player pilots a ship to destroy Dracon invaders. It is largely a clone of ''[[Star Raiders]]'' for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]].
