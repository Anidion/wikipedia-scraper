{{Nihongo foot|'''''Popeye'''''|ポパイ|Popai|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1982 [[platform game]] developed and released by [[Nintendo]] as an [[arcade video game]]. It is based on the [[Popeye (comic strip)|comic strip of the same name]] created by [[E. C. Segar]] and licensed from [[King Features Syndicate]]. Some sources claim that [[Ikegami Tsushinki]] did programming work on the game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Company:Ikegami Tsushinki - GDRI :: Game Developer Research Institute |url=http://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Company:Ikegami_Tsushinki |website=gdri.smspower.org}}</ref><ref>[http://d.hatena.ne.jp/bn2islander/20080817/1218980061 ドンキーコング裁判についてちょこっと考えてみる] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312191324/http://d.hatena.ne.jp/bn2islander/20080817/1218980061|date=March 12, 2010}} Thinking a bit about Donkey Kong, accessed February 1, 2009</ref><ref>{{Nihongo|It started from Pong|それは『ポン』から始まった : アーケードTVゲームの成り立ち|sore wa pon kara hajimatta: ākēdo terebi gēmu no naritachi}}, {{Nihongo|Masumi Akagi|赤木真澄|Akagi Masumi}}, {{Nihongo|Amusement Tsūshinsha|アミューズメント通信社|Amyūzumento Tsūshinsha}}, 2005, {{ISBN|4-9902512-0-2}}.</ref> As Popeye, the player must collect hearts thrown by Olive Oyl from the top of the screen while being chased by Bluto. Popeye can punch bottles thrown at him, but can only hurt Bluto after eating the one can of spinach present in each level. Unlike Nintendo's earlier ''Donkey Kong'' games, there is no jump button. There are three screens.

The game was licensed by [[Atari, Inc.]] for exclusive release in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in an Atari-designed cabinet. Nintendo ported the game to the [[Famicom]], and [[Parker Brothers]] published versions for other home systems. ''[[Popeye no Eigo Asobi]]'' is an English [[Educational video game|teaching]] spin-off released for the Famicom on November 22, 1983.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Popeye screenshots.png|left|thumb|The title screen and first level are in the top row; level 2 and 3 are below, from the arcade version.]]
The object of the game is for [[Popeye the Sailor]] to collect a certain number of items dropped by [[Olive Oyl]], depending on the level—24 hearts, 16 musical notes, or 24 letters in the word "HELP"—while avoiding the [[Sea Hag]], [[Bluto|Brutus]], and other dangers. The player can make Popeye walk back and forth and up and down stairs and ladders with a 4-way joystick. There is a punch button, but unlike similar games of the period, no jump button.

Brutus chases Popeye and can jump down a level, reach down to the next lower level, and jump up to hit Popeye if he is directly above. Popeye can attack Brutus after eating the can of spinach found in each level. Spinach makes Popeye invincible for a short period, during which Brutus runs away and can be temporarily knocked out simply by running into him.

Popeye punches to destroy harmful items such as bottles, vultures, and skulls. He loses a life when hit by Brutus or any flying object, or if he fails to collect a dropped item within a certain time after it reaches the bottom of the screen. On the first screen of each cycle, Popeye can hit a punching bag to knock a bucket off a hook; if it falls on Brutus's head, he becomes stunned for several seconds and the player earns a score bonus.

Other licensed ''Popeye'' characters in the game are Olive Oyl, [[Swee'Pea]], and [[J. Wellington Wimpy|Wimpy]].

== Development ==
''Popeye'' was designed by [[Genyo Takeda]] and [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Previously, Nintendo had originally intended to make a video game based on the ''Popeye'' characters, but was denied a license, so the characters of [[Mario]], [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], and [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Pauline]] were developed for ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web |last=East |first=Tom |date=November 25, 2009 |title=Donkey Kong Was Originally A Popeye Game |url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/13484/donkey-kong-was-originally-a-popeye-game/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110045437/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/13484/donkey-kong-was-originally-a-popeye-game/ |archive-date=November 10, 2014 |access-date=November 6, 2014 |work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] |quote=Miyamoto says Nintendo's main monkey might not have existed.}}</ref> Nintendo managed to acquire the license to the ''Popeye'' characters after the success of ''Donkey Kong'', allowing them to develop a game based on them.

==Ports==
[[Parker Brothers]] ported the game to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[Intellivision]], [[Commodore 64]], [[TI-99/4A]], and [[ColecoVision]]. It is one of the few games ported to the [[Magnavox Odyssey²]].

On July 15, 1983, ''Popeye'' became one of the three [[launch game]]s for the [[Famicom]], along with ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Marley|first=Scott |date=December 2016 |title=SG-1000 |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=163|pages=56–61|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Reception==
In the United States, ''Popeye'' topped the ''[[Play Meter]]'' arcade chart for street locations in April 1983.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Play Meter's Equipment Poll: Top Videos |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=May 1, 1983 |volume=9 |issue=8 |page=16 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-9-number-8-may-1st-1983-600dpi/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%209%2C%20Number%208%20-%20May%201st%2C%201983%20%28Compressed%29/page/16/mode/1up}}</ref>

''[[Electronic Games]]'' wrote in 1983 that the arcade version of ''Popeye'' at first appeared to be "yet another variation of a theme that's become all too familiar since ''Donkey Kong'' [...] But there are some nuances, not the least of which are the graphics and sound effects, that tend to allow the game the benefit of the doubt in execution. [...] ''Popeye'' does offer some interesting play that is more than complemented by the cosmetics."<ref name="sharpe198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n89/mode/2up | title=Insert Coin Here | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | access-date=January 6, 2015 | last=Sharpe | first=Roger C. | pages=92}}</ref> The ''Arcade Express'' newsletter scored it 7 out of 10 in January 1983, calling it "the closest thing to a videogame cartoon seen yet in an arcade", but also that "game play, unfortunately, doesn't come up to visual standards."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/newsletters/arcadeexpress/arcade_express_v1n11.pdf#page=6 |title=The Hotseat: Popeye |date=January 2, 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |magazine=The Arcade Express}}</ref> Michael Pugliese writing for ''The Coin Slot'' described ''Popeye'' as "a visually stimulating and exciting game that will go well in any location [...] it contains all the challenges and character appeal to make it a solid earner for a long time."<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Pugliese | first = Michael | date = April 1983 | title = Games in Review: The Arcade Parade | url = http://coinslot.arcade-museum.com/CoinSlot--83-04--V8N8/14/  | magazine = The Coin Slot | page = 14 | access-date = October 17, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine gave the arcade game a generally favorable review.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action: Packing a Punch!

==Legacy==
''[[Popeye no Eigo Asobi]]'' is an English teaching spin-off for [[Famicom]], released on November 22, 1983. A board game based on the video game was released by [[Parker Brothers]] in 1983.

In 2008, [[Namco Networks]] released an [[Video game remake|enhanced remake]] for mobile phones. The gameplay is largely the same, plus an enhanced mode with a bonus stage and an extra level that pays homage to the short ''A Dream Walking'' where Popeye must save Olive from sleepwalking. Tokens are earned to buy old comic strips.<ref>{{IGN|type=wireless|id=892/892996|name=Popeye}}</ref>

On November 4, 2021, ''Popeye'' was released for [[Nintendo Switch]] as a 3D [[remake|reimagining]] of the arcade game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/popeye-switch/|title=Popeye |work=Nintendo.com|publisher=Sabec LTD|date=November 2021}}</ref> It was met with poor [[Metacritic]] scores.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}
