'''''Space Duel''''' is an [[arcade game]] released in 1982 by [[Atari, Inc.]] It is a direct descendant of the original ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'', with asteroids replaced by colorful geometric shapes like cubes, diamonds, and spinning pinwheels. ''Space Duel'' is the first and only multiplayer [[vector game]] by Atari. When ''[[Asteroids Deluxe]]'' did not sell well, this game was taken off the shelf and released to moderate success.
