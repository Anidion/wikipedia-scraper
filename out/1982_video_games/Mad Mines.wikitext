==Reception==
Dick McGrath reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The originality is pretty low here, so ''Mad Mines'' [...] gets a 4 [out of 10]."<ref name="CGW8">{{cite magazine |last=McGrath |first=Dick |title=Route 80: The Road to TRS-80 Gaming |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jan–Feb 1983 |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=38–39}}</ref> In a review of six TRS-80 games for ''[[Creative Computing]]'', Owen Linzmayer was more impressed: {{Quote|''Mad Mines'' is one of the most professional arcade games available. It is constantly challenging because it requires both dexterity and strategy. I have a special bunch of games that I keep on-hand to show off to friends–''Mad Mines'' has earned its place in that limited group.<ref name=pick6/>}}
Linzmayer described ''Mad Mines'' as a combination of the Apple II games ''[[Space Eggs]]'' and ''[[Ceiling Zero (video game)|Ceiling Zero]]''.<ref name=pick6/>
