'''''Hazard Run''''' is a 1982 [[Racing video game|racing]] video game developed by Dennis R. Zander and published by [[Artworx]] for [[Atari 8-bit computers]].<ref name=AC>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/analog-computing-magazine-06/Analog_Computing_06_1982-05_Maniac_Pirating#page/n23/mode/1up/|title=Artworx.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Hazard_Run_Atari_8-bit_screenshot.png|thumb|left|The Gee Lee beginning a river jump]]

''Hazard Run'' is played from an overhead perspective, with vertically scrolling gameplay.<ref name=Soft/><ref name=EG/><ref name=Page6/> The player, driving the ''Gee Lee'',<ref name=AC/> must escape a crooked sheriff while avoiding hazards such as ducks, fences, rocks, rivers, and trees. The player is given five cars, which act as lives. The player loses a car if an obstacle is hit. The car can be [[Ski (driving stunt)|driven on two tires]] to maneuver through tight areas. There are five courses, known as ''runs'', with each one longer than the previous.<ref name=Soft/><ref name=EG/> The player is required to save up extra gasoline in later levels by driving over gas cans.

The perspective switches to a side view when the Gee Lee approaches a jump over a river. Upon clearing the final river, the pursuing police vehicle lands in the water. [[Bar (music)|Bars]] from the song "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]" play after each river jump, regardless of the outcome.<ref name=Soft/><ref name=EG/>

==Reception==
Derrick Bang, writing for ''Softline'' magazine, wrote that the game's "major problem" was its joystick control scheme. Bang also criticized the "Dixie" music played in each of the game's river sections: "it would be nicer (and preferable psychologically) to hear something different as a reward for making the jump." Bang concluded that the game "is just a bit too primitive for today's market and will be of interest mostly to neophytes and young children."<ref name=Soft>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/softline_2.1.pdf|title=Hazard Run|last=Bang|first=Derrick|date=September 1982|work=Softline|accessdate=August 14, 2016|page=25}}</ref>

Ted Salamone of ''[[Electronic Games]]'' called the game "well conceived" but "poorly executed." Salamone criticized the game's "sloppy play action" and wrote that the graphics "finish in first and last place. Some (the overhead view of a car and trees) are done well, while others (the auto's side view when jumping water) look like a sixth grader's first art project."<ref name=EG>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1985-01/Electronic_Games_Issue_35_Vol_03_11_1985_Jan#page/n39/mode/2up/|title=Hazard Run|last=Salamone|first=Ted|date=January 1985|work=[[Electronic Games]]|accessdate=August 14, 2016|pages=40{{ndash}}41}}</ref> In 1991, ''[[Page 6|New Atari User]]'' gave the game a "mediocre" score of two stars out of four, calling it "Pretty shallow" while also noting its rarity.<ref name=Page6>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/page6-magazine-52/Page6_52_Oct_1991#page/n26/mode/1up/|title=The A-Z of Golden (and Not So Golden) Oldies: Hazzard Run|date=October 1991|work=[[Page 6|New Atari User]]|accessdate=August 14, 2016|page=27}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1984, Artworx considered licensing the title of the television series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' in order to re-publish ''Hazard Run'' as a [[tie-in]]. Artworx later rejected the idea considering the aftermath of the [[North American video game crash of 1983|1983 video game crash]], which involved many licensed games receiving a negative reputation for their simple concepts and gameplay. The cost to purchase the license was also deemed too high, considering the small size of the software market at the time. ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' was the only title Artworx ever seriously considered licensing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/06-commodore-magazine/Commodore_Magazine_Vol-08-N06_1987_Jun#page/n79/mode/1up/|title=Artworx Rejects Dukes of Hazzard|last=Jermaine|first=John|date=June 1987|work=[[Commodore Power/Play|Commodore Magazine]]|accessdate=August 14, 2016|page=78}}</ref>
