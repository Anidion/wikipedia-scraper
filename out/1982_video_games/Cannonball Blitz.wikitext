'''''Cannonball Blitz''''' is a game programmed by Olaf Lubeck for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line|On-Line Systems]] in 1982. It was ported to the [[VIC-20]] and [[TI-99/4A]] computers. An historic military spin on ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', rolling cannonballs replace barrels, a soldier stands in for the large ape, and the objective of the first level is a flag rather than a kidnapped girl.

==Gameplay==
There are three different screens, the third of which is particularly challenging. After completing the third level, the player views a small celebration scene and then restarts at the first level. Repeated levels only differ from those of the first round in the harsher timing patterns of the game.

==Development==
''Cannonball Blitz'' achieved some notoriety in the Apple hacking community as being difficult to crack. Track 17, sector D of the game contains the message "YOU'LL NEVER CRACK IT".<ref>[http://www.textfiles.com/100/krckwczt.app Krakowicz's Kracking Korner: The Basics of Kracking, Part II]</ref>

==Reception==
Ron Brinkmann reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "In the final analysis, ''Cannonball Blitz'' is a game every bit as challenging and fun as the arcade original. It will give you hours (days, months, years) of enjoyment."<ref name="CGW6">{{cite magazine |last=Gittleman |first=Barry |title=Micro - Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September–October 1982 |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=42}}</ref>

''[[Ahoy!]]'' wrote that "''Cannonball Blitz'' [for the VIC-20], make no mistake about it, is ''Donkey Kong'' in dress blues. Not a bloody thing new here. However, you're going to find it a barrel of fun". The magazine favorably reviewed the animation and the "''unbelievable''" sound effects, and concluded that it was "a very good version of a fine game".<ref name="meade198401">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_01_1984-01_Ion_International_US#page/n55/mode/2up | title=Cannonball Blitz | work=Ahoy! | date=January 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Meade, E.
