{{nihongo foot|'''''Xevious'''''|ゼビウス|Zebiusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Namco]] in 1982. It was released in Japan by Namco and in North America by [[Atari, Inc.]] Controlling the Solvalou starship, the player attacks Xevious forces before they destroy all of mankind. The Solvalou has two weapons at its disposal: a ''zapper'' to destroy flying craft, and a ''blaster'' to bomb ground installations and enemies. It runs on the [[Namco Galaga]] arcade system.

The game was designed by [[Masanobu Endō]] and a small team. Created to rival the success of ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'', it was originally themed around the [[Vietnam War]] and titled ''Cheyenne''. Endō wanted the game to have a detailed, integral storyline and a comprehensive world, and to be welcoming for newer players. Several enemies and characters were made to pay homage to other popular science fiction works, including ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[UFO (British TV series)|UFO]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''.

''Xevious'' was praised for its detailed graphics, challenge, and originality. It became an unprecedented success for Namco in Japan, with record-breaking sales figures making it the biggest game since ''[[Space Invaders]]''. The North American release paled in comparison, despite still selling 5,295 arcade units by the end of 1983. It has been listed among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]] and one of the most influential games in the [[shoot 'em up]] genre, establishing the template for vertically scrolling shooters and inspiring games such as ''[[TwinBee]]'' and ''[[RayForce]]''. It was ported to home systems, followed by several sequels and spin-offs,  and is included in many [[List of Bandai Namco video game compilations|Namco compilations]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Xevious Start2.png|thumb|Approaching a group of flying enemies and two ground targets]]

''Xevious'' is a vertically scrolling shooter. The player controls a flying attack craft, the Solvalou, to destroy the Xevious forces plotting to take over Earth.<ref name="Guidebook"/> The Solvalou has two weapons:  a ''zapper'' that fires projectiles at flying enemies<ref name="FC manual">{{cite book |title=Xevious instruction manual (FC) |date=1984 |publisher=Namco |pages=9 |url=http://www.videogameden.com/fc/extra/xev.pdf}}</ref> and a ''blaster'' for bombing ground installations and vehicles.<ref name="FC manual"/> A reticle in front of the ship shows where bombs will land.<ref name="FC manual"/>

The game has a total of 16 connected areas, which loop back to the first after completing them all.<ref name="Guidebook"/> Dying about 70% through starts the player at the beginning of the next.<ref name="hardcore">{{cite news |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/xevious/xevious.htm |title=Xevious |author=Savorelli, Carlo |work=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=2010-02-02 |archive-date=2017-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612094653/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/xevious/xevious.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Areas are geographically distinct, with features such as forests, roads, rivers, and mechanical structures. Certain areas have [[Nazca lines]] placed on the ground, some in the "condor" design.<ref name="hardcore"/>

The game becomes progressively more difficult as the player becomes more skilled. Once the player does well at destroying a certain enemy type, a more advanced enemy type replaces it.<ref name="hardcore"/> Destroying flashing-red "Zolback" radars found on the ground will cause the game to switch back to easier enemies.<ref name="hardcore"/><ref name="Guidebook"/>

Certain points in the game have a fight against the Andor Genesis mothership, which launch an endless stream of projectiles and explosive black spheres known as "Zakatos".<ref name="FC manual"/> The player can either destroy all four blaster receptacles or the core in the center to defeat it.<ref name="FC manual"/> Some parts of the game have hidden towers ("Sol Citadels"), which can be found by bombing specific parts of an area.<ref name="Guidebook"/> The Solvalou's bomb reticle flashes red when over one.<ref name="Guidebook">{{cite book |title=Xevious guidebook |date=1984 |publisher=Wasa |pages=40}}</ref> Yellow "Special Flags" from Namco's own ''[[Rally-X]]'' are found in a semi-random section of the area.

==Development==
''Xevious'' was designed by [[Masanobu Endō]], who joined [[Namco]] in April 1981 as a planner.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> He and a small team were assigned by Namco's marketing department to create a two-button scrolling shooter that could rival the success of [[Konami]]'s arcade game ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' (1981).<ref name="Interview Collection"/> Early versions of the game were named ''Cheyenne'' and took place during the [[Vietnam War]], with the player controlling a helicopter to shoot down enemies.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> (The original name may refer to the Vietnam-era [[Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne]] advanced [[attack helicopter]] project.) After the development team was reshuffled and the project planner quit altogether, Endō became the head designer for the game.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> He learned programming on the job during production.<ref name="Interview Collection">{{cite web |title=Xevious - Developer Interview Collection |url=http://shmuplations.com/xevious/ |website=Shmuplations |access-date=9 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505214857/http://shmuplations.com/xevious/ |archive-date=5 May 2019 |year=2015}}</ref>

Endō wanted the game to have a consistent, detailed world with a story that didn't feel like a "tacked-on extra", instead being an integral part of the game.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> The goal of the project was for the game to be inviting for newer players, and to become gradually more difficult as they became better at the game.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> Influenced by ray-tracing, Endō wanted the game's sprites to be high-quality and detailed, while also making sure they fit the limitations of the arcade board it ran on.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> The team used a method that involved giving each sprite different shades of gray, allowing sprites to display additional colors.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> Many of the sprites were designed by Endō himself, although some were done by [[Hiroshi Ono (artist)|Hiroshi "Mr. Dotman" Ono]], including the player and the background designs.

Many of the game's characters and structures were designed and refined by Shigeki Toyama, who previously worked on many of Namco's robotics for their amusement centers in the early 1980s.<ref name="Toyama">{{cite web |title=Shigeki Toyama and Namco Arcade Machines |url=http://shmuplations.com/shigekitoyama/ |website=Shmuplations |access-date=9 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914183308/http://shmuplations.com/shigekitoyama/ |archive-date=14 September 2019 |year=2016}}</ref> The player's ship, the Solvalou, is based on the ''Nostromo'' space tug from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', while several of the enemies are homages to starships from popular science fiction works, including ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[UFO (British TV series)|UFO]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''.<ref name="Toyama"/>

Concept art for the Andor Genesis mothership depicted it with a more circular design, nicknamed "Gofuru" due to it bearing resemblance to gofuru cookies.{{efn|''Gaufre'' means "waffle" in French, and the Japanese [[Romanization of Japanese|''rōmaji'']] of ''gaufre'' is ''gofuru'' according to [[Hepburn romanization]].}}<ref name="Toyama"/> The design was changed to instead be the shape of an octagon as the hardware had difficulty displaying round objects, while still keeping much of its key features such as the central core and blaster receptacles.<ref name="Toyama"/> Endō created a fictional language during development called "Xevian" that he used to name each of the enemies.<ref name="Interview Collection"/>

The blaster target for the Solvalou, which flashes red when over an enemy to signal the player to fire a bomb at it, was added to make it easier to destroy ground targets.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> While programming it, Endō thought it would be interesting to have the blaster target flash over a blank space where an enemy wasn't present, leading to the addition of the Sol citadels.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> Namco executives expressed displeasure towards the idea, with Endō instead claiming they were simply a bug in the program and leaving them in the code.<ref name="Interview Collection"/>

The Special Flag icons from ''[[Rally-X]]'' were added due to Endō being a fan of the game.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> The game was originally named ''Zevious'', the "X" being added to make it sound more exotic and mysterious, with the metallic logo paying homage to the pinball table ''Xenon''.<ref name="Interview Collection"/> Location testing for ''Xevious'' was conducted in December 1982, and the game was released in Japan in January 1983.<ref>{{cite book |last=Akagi |first=Masumi |url=https://archive.org/stream/ArcadeGameList1971-2005#page/n54/mode/1up |title=ナムコ Namco; Namco America; X |work=アーケードTVゲームリスト 国内•海外編 (1971-2005) |edition=1st |publisher=Amusement News Agency |date=13 October 2006 |pages=53, 126, 166 |isbn=978-4990251215 |language=ja}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=『ナムコミュージアム VOL.2』は、この6タイトル |url=https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/cs/list/nm/vol2.php |publisher=[[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] |access-date=24 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903061537/https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/cs/list/nm/vol2.php |archive-date=3 September 2019 |language=ja |date=February 1996}}</ref> In the months following, [[Atari, Inc.]] acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute it in North America, advertising it as "the Atari game you can't play at home".<ref name="hardcore"/>
