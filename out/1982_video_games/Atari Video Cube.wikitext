==Gameplay==

The game implements a [[Pocket Cube]], [[Rubik's Cube]] and [[Rubik's Revenge]]. The player takes control of "Hubie the Cube Master" as he tries to solve a scrambled "Video Cube". Hubie's method for solving the cube is to pick up the colored segments one-by-one and place them in their correct spaces. Picking up a square, however, limits Hubie's movements; he cannot move onto a square that matches the color of the one he is carrying.

The game manual encourages players to try and solve the cube in as few moves as possible, with their total number of moves being counted at the bottom of the screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareID=834|title=AtariAge - Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Atari Video Cube (Atari)}}</ref> ''Atari Video Cube'' has several game modes that alter the difficulty of the game, such as square count and color range.
