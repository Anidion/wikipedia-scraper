'''''Pac-Man''''' is a 1982 [[maze video game]] developed and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] under official license by [[Namco]], and an adaptation of the [[Pac-Man|1980 arcade game ''Pac-Man'']]. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the title character]], who attempts to consume all of the wafers in a maze while avoiding [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|four ghosts]] that pursue him. Eating flashing wafers at the corners of the screen causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue and flee, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points. Once eaten, a ghost is reduced to a pair of eyes, which return to the center of the maze to be restored.

Programmed by [[Tod Frye]], ''Pac-Man'' took six months to complete. Expecting high sales, Atari produced over a million copies of the highly anticipated game and held a "National Pac-Man Day" on April 3, 1982 to promote its release.<ref name="pacday">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ruYNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lG0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4164,6921922&dq=atari+pac-man |title=Only Four More Days Until Atari National Pac-Man Day |date=March 30, 1982 |access-date=2009-07-23}}</ref>

It remains the [[List of best-selling Atari 2600 video games|best-selling Atari 2600 game]] of all time, selling over {{nowrap|8 million}} copies, and was the all time [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video game]] for several years. Despite its commercial success, ''Pac-Man'' was panned by critics for poor graphics  and sound, and for bearing little resemblance to the original game. It has been considered one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games ever made]] and one of the worst arcade game ports released on the system.

==Gameplay==

The player uses a joystick to control [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], navigating him through a maze of consumable dashes called video wafers, opposed by a quartet of multi-colored ghosts.<ref name="AtariMan-2">{{cite book|title=Pac-Man Atari Game Program Instructions|year=1981|publisher=Atari|id=C016943-46 REV 1|page=2}}</ref><ref name="AtariMan-34">{{cite book|title=Pac-Man Atari Game Program Instructions|year=1981|publisher=Atari|id=C016943-46 REV 1|pages=3–4}}</ref> The goal of the game is to earn a high score by having Pac-Man eat video wafers, power pills, vitamins and ghosts.

Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing consumables known as Power Pills that turn the ghosts into a blue transparent colour Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn points.<ref name="AtariMan-2" /> When a ghost is eaten, its disembodied eyes return to the big square chamber in the center of the maze to respawn.<ref name="AtariMan-34" /> The blue ghosts turn pink during the last moments of a Power Pill's effect, signaling that they are about to become dangerous again.<ref name="AtariMan-2" /> The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest an award the player with further points.<ref name="AtariMan-2" />

The game has eight variations, offering two different starting speeds for Pac-Man and four speeds for the ghosts.<ref name="AtariMan-8">{{cite book|title=Pac-Man Atari Game Program Instructions|year=1981|publisher=Atari|id=C016943-46 REV 1|page=8}}</ref> Setting the console's A–B difficulty switches can also handicap one or both players.

''Pac-Man'' for the Atari 2600 has various changes from the original game.<ref name="Weiss" /> Visual changes include the ghosts not having unique colors, and not looking in the direction they are moving in.

The game has a different maze than the arcade game.<ref name="Weiss" />
There are fewer video wafers, and are displayed as thin rectangles instead of dots like in the arcade version.<ref>{{cite book|title= Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System|last1=Montfort|first1=Nick|last2=Bogost|first2=Ian|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01257-7|chapter=Pac-Man|title-link=Racing the Beam|page=69}}</ref> The maze in this version of the game is simplified in structure and appearance, lacking the rounded edges lacking the more intricate passages of the arcade and changes the escape passages from the sides to the top and bottom of the screen.<ref name="AtariMan-34" /><ref name="Allgame">{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=8518|title=Pac-Man - Overview|last=Miller|first=Skyler|website=[[AllGame]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214104425/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=8518|archive-date=February 14, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=July 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title= Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System|last1=Montfort|first1=Nick|last2=Bogost|first2=Ian|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01257-7|chapter=Pac-Man|title-link=Racing the Beam|page=68}}</ref>

==Development==

After ''Pac-Man'' proved to be a success in the United States, Atari decided to license the game and produce it for its [[Atari 2600]] console.<ref name="NG-40">{{cite magazine|author=Staff|date=April 1998|title=What the hell happened?|url=https://archive.org/details/NextGeneration40Apr1998/page/n39|magazine=[[Next Generation Magazine]]|publisher=[[Future plc|Imagine Media]]|issue=40|page=41}}</ref><ref name="Racing">{{cite book|title= Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System|last1=Montfort|first1=Nick|last2=Bogost|first2=Ian|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01257-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/racingbeamatariv00mont_656/page/n78 66]–79|chapter=Pac-Man|title-link=Racing the Beam}}</ref>

Programming was assigned to Tod Frye, who was not provided with any arcade design specifications to work from and had to figure out how the game worked by playing it. He spent 80-hour weeks over six months developing it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lapetino|first=Tim|date=2018|title=The Story of PAC-MAN on Atari 2600|journal=Retro Gamer Magazine|volume=179|pages=18–23}}</ref> The finished game uses a 4&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] [[ROM cartridge]], chosen for its lower manufacturing costs compared to 8&nbsp;KB bank-switched cartridges which had recently become available.<ref name="NG-40"/><ref name="Racing"/> As with any contemporary arcade port, the simple Atari 2600 hardware was a considerable limitation. The arcade PAC-MAN [[Motherboard|system board]] contained 2&nbsp;KB of main RAM ([[random-access memory]]) in which to run the program, 2&nbsp;KB of video RAM to store the screen state, and 16&nbsp;KB of ROM ([[read-only memory]]) to store the game code, whereas the Atari 2600 featured only 128 [[byte]]s of RAM memory and none dedicated to video: effectively 32 times less RAM.<ref name="Racing"/> The [[Zilog Z80]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] [[microprocessor]] used by the [[Namco Pac-Man]] arcade system is clocked at three times the speed of the [[MOS Technology 6507|MOS 6507]] CPU in the Atari 2600 - though the Z80 typically does less work per clock cycle.<ref name="Montfort-67">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqePfdz_x6gC&pg=PA67|title=Racing the beam: the Atari Video computer system|last1=Montfort|first1=Nick|last2=Bogost|first2=Ian|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01257-7|page=67|access-date=May 7, 2011}}</ref>

To deal with these limitations, Frye simplified the maze's intricate pattern of corridors to a more repetitive pattern. The small tan pellets in the arcade original were changed to rectangular "wafers" that shared the wall color on 2600; a change necessitated because both the pellets and walls were drawn with the 2600's Playfield graphics, which have a fixed width. To achieve the visual effect of wafers disappearing as Pac-Man eats them, the actual map of the maze was updated as the data was written into the Playfield registers, excluding those pellets that had been eaten. The 2600's Player-Missile graphics system ([[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]) was used for the remaining objects; the one-bit-wide Missiles were used to render the flashing power pills and the center of the vitamin. Pac-Man and ghost characters were implemented using the 2600's two Player objects, with one being used for Pac-Man and the other being used for all four ghosts, with the result that each ghost only appears once out of every four frames, which creates a flickering effect. This effect takes advantage of the slow [[Phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] fade of [[CRT monitors]] and the concept of [[persistence of vision]], resulting in the image appearing to linger on screen longer,<ref name="Racing"/> but the flickering remains noticeable, and makes each individual ghost's color nearly impossible to discern.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System|url=https://archive.org/details/racingbeamatariv00mont_656|url-access=limited|last1=Bogost|first1=Ian|last2=Montfort|first2=Nick|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01257-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/racingbeamatariv00mont_656/page/n86 74]–75}}</ref> Frye chose to abandon plans for a flicker-management system to minimize the flashing in part because Atari didn't seem to care about that issue in its zeal to have the game released. According to Frye, his game also did not conform to the arcade game's color scheme in order to comply with Atari's official home product policy that only space-type games should feature black backgrounds. Another quality impact was his decision that two-player gameplay was important, which meant that the 23 bytes required to store the current difficulty, state of the dots on the current maze, remaining lives, and the score had to be doubled for a second player,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://atariage.com/forums/topic/270699-in-defense-of-pac-man/page-6#entry3864608|title=In defense of Pac-Man... - Page 6 - Atari 2600|work=AtariAge Forums|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en}}</ref> consuming 46 of the 2600's meager 128-byte memory, which precluded its use for additional game data and features.<ref>{{Cite video|last=Reutter|first=Hans|title=PRGE 2016 - Tod Frye - Portland Retro Gaming Expo|date=October 27, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuTJpZ99P0c&t=9m25s |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/cuTJpZ99P0c |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|access-date=May 12, 2017|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Oft-repeated stories claim that the company wanted to or did release a prototype in order to capitalize on the 1981 [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]];<ref name="Racing" /> however, the retail release was a final product. Frye states that there were no negative comments within Atari about these elements, but, after seeing the game, Coin Division marketing manager Frank Ballouz reportedly informed [[Ray Kassar]], Atari's president and CEO, that he felt enthusiasts would not want to play it. His opinion, however, was dismissed.<ref name="NG-40" /> The company ran newspaper ads and promoted the product in catalogs, describing it as differing "slightly from the original".<ref name="CCVAG">{{Cite magazine|last=Goodman|first=Danny|date=Spring 1983|title=Pac-Mania|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/pacmania.php|url-status=live|magazine=[[Creative Computing]] Video & Arcade Games|volume=1|issue=1|page=122|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181212180528/https://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/pacmania.php|archive-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref>

===Critical response===

The main character travels through the corridors of a brown maze to eat white wafers while avoiding four flickering ghosts.|Pac-Man must eat the wafers while avoiding the ghosts. The ghosts take turns appearing on the screen, creating a flicker effect that was widely criticized]]

At release, critics negatively compared the port to its original arcade form, panning the audio-visuals and gameplay. On May 11, 1982, [[Electronic Games magazine|''Electronic Games Magazine'']] published its first bad review ever for an Atari video game, saying, "Considering the anticipation and considerable time the Atari designers had to work on it, it’s astonishing to see a home version of a classic arcade contest so devoid of what gave the original its charm". [[Video (magazine)|''Video Magazine'']] admitted it was "challenging, and there are a few visual pluses", before lamenting, "Unfortunately those who cannot evaluate Pac-Man through lover's eyes are likely to be disappointed". The premiere issue of ''Video Games Player'' from Fall 1982 called Pac-Man "just awful".<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=September 1982|others=Illustrated by Kris Boyd|title=Fall 1982 Complete Home Video Games Buyer's Guide|url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Player_Vol_1_No_1_1982-09_Carnegie_Publications_US#page/n58/mode/1up|magazine=Video Games Player|publisher=Carnegie Publications|volume=1|issue=1|page=59|access-date=May 9, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Electronic Games]]'' gave the game a rating of four out of ten.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pac-Man: Atari VCS |journal=[[Electronic Games]] |date=1983 |issue=1983 Software Encyclopedia |page=28 |url=https://archive.org/details/1983_Software_Encyclopedia_Number_1_1983_Reese_Communications_US/page/n27}}</ref> ''Video Games Player'' magazine gave the graphics and sound its lowest rating of C, while giving the game an overall B− rating.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Software Report Card |magazine=Video Games Player |date=September 1982 |volume=1 |issue=1 |publisher=Carnegie Publications |location=United States |pages=62–3 |url=https://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Player_Vol_1_No_1_1982-09_Carnegie_Publications_US/page/n61/mode/2up}}</ref> ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]''

In 1983, ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]] Video & Arcade Games'' reviewer [[Danny Goodman]] commented that the game fails as a replica of its arcade form: "Atari stated clearly in its description of the cartridge that Atari's Pac-Man 'differs slightly from the original'. That, perhaps, was an understatement." Conversely, he stated that such criticism was unfair because the hardware could not properly emulate the arcade game. Goodman further said that the port is a challenging maze game in its own right, and it would have been a success if fans had not expected to play a game closer to the original.<ref name="CCVAG"/> That year Phil Wiswell of ''Video Games'' criticized the game's poor graphics, mockingly referring to it as "Flickerman",<ref name="wiswell198303">{{cite journal|last=Wiswell|first=Phil|date=March 1983|title=New Games From Well-Known Names|url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_06_1983-03_Pumpkin_Press_US#page/n67/mode/2up|journal=Video Games|volume=1|issue=6|page=71|access-date=May 26, 2014}}</ref> while ''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' questioned why Atari opposed ''Pac-Man'' clones when the 2600 version was less like the original "than any of the pack of imitators".<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=March 1983|title=Strange Games|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/softline_2.4.pdf#page=49|url-status=live|magazine=Softline|page=49|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703043430/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/softline_2.4.pdf|archive-date=July 3, 2018|access-date=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

The game has remained poorly rated.

Frye did not express regret over his part in ''Pac-Man''{{'}}s port and felt he made the best decisions he could at the time. However, Frye stated that he would have done things differently with a larger capacity ROM.<ref name="NG-40" /> Video game industry researchers [[Nick Montfort]] and [[Ian Bogost]] attribute the poor reception to the technical differences between the 1977 Atari 2600 console and the 1980 arcade hardware used in ''Pac-Man'' cabinets. They further stated that the conversion is a lesson in maintaining the social and cultural context of the original source. Montfort and Bogost commented that players were disappointed with the flickering visual effect, which made the ghosts difficult to track and tired the players' eyes. The two further said that the effect diminishes the ghosts' personalities present in the arcade version.<ref name="Racing" /> Chris Kohler of ''[[Wired (magazine)#Website|Wired]]'' commented that the game was poorly received upon its release and in contemporary times because of the poor quality. However, he further described the game as an impressive technical achievement given its console's limitations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/03/racing-the-beam/|title=Racing the Beam: How Atari 2600's Crazy Hardware Changed Game Design|last=Kohler|first=Chris|date=March 13, 2009|website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910053052/https://www.wired.com/2009/03/racing-the-beam/|archive-date=September 10, 2014|url-status=live|access-date=July 29, 2009}}</ref>

==Impact and legacy==

Initially, the excitement generated by ''Pac-Man''{{'}}s home release prompted retail stores to expand their inventory to sell video games. Drugstores began stocking video game cartridges, and toy retailers vied for new releases. [[Kmart (United States)|Kmart]] and J. C. Penney competed against Sears to become the largest vendor of video games.<ref name="Ultimate-1"/> The game's release also led to an increase in sales of the Atari 2600 console.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Hubner|first1=John|last2=Kistner|first2=William F.

In retrospect, however, critics often cite Atari's ''Pac-Man'' as a major factor in the drop of consumer confidence in the company, which contributed to the [[video game crash of 1983]]. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of [[Gamasutra]] stated that the game's poor quality damaged the company's reputation.<ref name="Gama-2600"/> Buchanan commented that it disappointed millions of fans and diminished confidence in Atari's games.<ref name="IGN-TopSelling"/><ref name="IGN-Turkey">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/26/top-10-videogame-turkeys|title=Top 10 Videogame Turkeys|last=Buchanan|first=Levi|date=November 26, 2008|website=[[IGN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322110317/https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/26/top-10-videogame-turkeys|archive-date=March 22, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> Former ''Next Generation'' editor-in-chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari's quality to the disappointment he had from buying the game as a child.<ref name="NG-40"/> Calling the game the top video game disaster, Buchanan credits ''Pac-Man'' as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the 1980s.<ref name="IGN-Turkey"/> Author [[Steven L.

On December 7, 1982, Atari owner [[Warner Communications]] announced that revenue forecasts for 1982 were cut from a 50% increase over 1981 to a 15% increase.<ref name="NG-40"/><ref name="GI-140">{{cite magazine|magazine= [[Game Informer]]| publisher = [[GameStop]]| title = This Month in Gaming History| page = 202| author = Staff| issue = 140|date=December 2004}}</ref> Immediately following the announcement, the company's stock value dropped by around 35%—from $54 to $35—amounting to a loss of $1.3&nbsp;billion in the company's [[Market-based valuation|market valuation]].<ref name="NG-40"/><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Taylor|first=Alexander L.|date=December 20, 1982|title=Pac-Man Finally Meets His Match|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923197,00.html|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|volume=120|issue=25|access-date=September 30, 2009|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Warner admitted that ''Pac-Man''{{'}}s good sales despite poor quality made Atari overconfident about ''E.T.'' and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (video game)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which did not sell well.<ref name="pollack19821219">{{Cite news |last=Pollack |first=Andrew |date=1982-12-19 |title=THE GAME TURNS SERIOUS AT ATARI (Published 1982) |language=en-US |page=Section 3, Page 1 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/19/business/the-game-turns-serious-at-atari.html |access-date=2021-02-18 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 1983, the company decreased its workforce by 30% and lost $356&nbsp;million.<ref name="Ultimate-2"/>

In late 1982, Atari ported ''Pac-Man'' to its new console, the [[Atari 5200]]. This version was a more accurate conversion of the original arcade game and was a [[Launch game|launch title]] for the console, along with eleven other games.<ref name="Ultimate-2" /><ref>{{cite book| title = The Ultimate History of Video Games| last = Kent| first = Steven| year = 2001| chapter = The Fall| publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]]| page = 229| isbn = 978-0-7615-3643-7}}</ref>

The port was followed by conversions of ''Pac-Man''{{'}}s arcade sequels, ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Jr. Pac-Man]]'', for the Atari 2600. These used 8&nbsp;KB ROM cartridges instead of ''Pac-Man'''s 4&nbsp;KB and dispensed with two-player games. They were better received than Atari's first ''Pac-Man'' title<ref name="Gama-2600"/> and addressed many critics' complaints of ''Pac-Man''.<ref name="Racing"/>
