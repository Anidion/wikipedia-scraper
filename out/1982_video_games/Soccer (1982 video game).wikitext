'''''Soccer''''' is a [[sports video game]] for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] published in 1982 by [[Gamma Software]].<ref name=mania/>

==Gameplay==
''Soccer'' is a sports game in which 2-4 players compete in an arcade-style game.<ref name="CGW7"/>

==Reception==
Allen Doum reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The graphics are of the kind that leave [[George Plimpton]] flat. For those who like the arcade style sports games, these games fall short of what the computer is capable of. However, as two-player sports games, they can be exciting."<ref name="CGW7">{{cite magazine |last=Doum |first=Allen |title=Four for the Atari |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Novâ€“Dec 1982 |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=20}}</ref> Bill Kunkel wrote a lukewarm review for ''[[Electronic Games]]'' which leads off with:

{{quote|text=Gamma's second entry into the otherwise empty computer sports simulations market, while not a total rave-up, at least shows considerable improvement over their debut program (the inept ''[[Hockey (1981 video game)|Hockey]]).''<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kunkel |first1=Bill |title=Computer Gaming: Soccer |magazine=Electronic Games |date=January 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |page=78 |url=https://archive.org/details/ElectronicGames/Electronic%20Games%20Issue%2011%20(January%201983)/page/n83/mode/2up}}</ref>}}
