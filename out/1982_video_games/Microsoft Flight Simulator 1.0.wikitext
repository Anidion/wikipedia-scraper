'''''Microsoft Flight Simulator''''', commonly known as '''''Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0''''', is a [[flight simulator]] [[video game]], released in November 1982 for the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]].<ref name="hockman198704">{{cite magazine | title=Bruce Artwick's Flight Simulator / You've Come A Long Way, Baby! / The History of an Epic Program | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=36 | date=April 1987 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1987&pub=2&id=36 | accessdate=23 April 2016 | last=Hockman | first=Daniel | pages=32–34}}</ref> It is the first release in the ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'' series.

Around the years of 1981–82, [[Microsoft]] contacted [[Bruce Artwick]] of [[Sublogic]], creator of ''[[FS1 Flight Simulator]]'', to develop a new flight simulator for IBM compatible PCs. This version was released in November 1982 as ''Microsoft Flight Simulator''.  It featured an improved graphics engine, variable weather and time of day, and a new coordinate system (used by all subsequent versions up to version 5).  It was later updated and ported to other home computers as ''[[Flight Simulator II (Sublogic)|Flight Simulator II]]'', published by Sublogic.

Advertisements claimed "If flying your IBM PC got any more realistic, you'd need a license", and promised "a full-color, out-the-window flight display".<ref name="pc198212">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vy3cBZkjbZgC&pg=PA405 | title=If flying your IBM PC got any more realistic, you'd need a license. | work=PC Magazine | date=December 1982 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Advertisement | pages=Inside front cover}}</ref> Early versions of ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' were used as a test for [[IBM PC compatible|PC compatibility]].

==Gameplay==
In ''Microsoft Flight Simulator (1.0)'', the player flies a [[Cessna 182]] in one of four US regions: [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], or [[Seattle]].  The starting airport was [[Meigs Field]] in Chicago, with a view of the city skyline to the left and [[Lake Michigan]] to the right.  It would remain the default airport in future versions of ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'', until the real airport was closed.

There was also a "Europe 1917" mode which was similar to the "British Ace" mode of ''FS1 Flight Simulator''.  This mode had the player flying a [[Sopwith Camel]] in a grid-divided area with mountains on two sides.  They could declare war and fire at enemy aircraft.
