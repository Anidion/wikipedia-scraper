'''''Artillery Duel''''' is an [[artillery game]] originally written for the [[Bally Astrocade]] by Perkins Engineering and published by Bally in 1982. John Perkins wrote the game first in [[Astro BASIC]], submitting it to ''The Arcadian'' [[fanzine]], from which it was adapted for the Astro BASIC manual.{{ref|AstroBASIC|p=95}} Perkins subsequently developed the Astrocade cartridge.

[[Xonox]] published ports for the [[Atari 2600]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[VIC-20]]. ''Artillery Duel'' was featured in several double-ended cartridges – with one game on each end – as well as in a single cartridge.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ArtilleryDuel-2600.png|thumb]]
The game consists of dueling [[cannon]]s on either side of a hill or mountain of varying height and shape. Each player has control of the incline and force behind the shell launched, the objective being to score a direct hit on the opposing target. Where many versions gave the player a few tries on the same course, ''Artillery Duel'' switches to a new mountain after each turn. When the player does manage to hit the opposing cannon, the reward is a brief animation of comically marching soldiers at the bottom of the screen.

==Reception==
[[Danny Goodman]] of ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]] Video & Arcade Games'' said after visiting the summer 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] that "the cleverest graphics award goes to ''Artillery Duel''" for the [[Bally Astrocade]], describing it as "really a graphics showpiece with a little bit of player interaction thrown in".<ref name="goodman1983spring">{{Cite magazine |last=Goodman |first=Danny |author-link=Danny Goodman |date=Spring 1983 |title=Home Video Games: Video Games Update |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/vgupdate.php |magazine=Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games |page=32}}</ref>
