'''''Flight Simulation''''' is a [[Flight simulation video game|flight simulation]] program written by [[Psion (computers)|Psion]] and marketed by [[Sinclair Research]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[ZX81]] home computers.

In the [[United States]], [[Timex Sinclair]] marketed the ZX81 version as '''''The Flight Simulator''''' for the American version of the ZX81, the [[Timex Sinclair 1000]].<ref name='stuff_timex'>{{cite web|url=http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/generated/tapeinfo/f/FlightSimulatorThe.html |title=ZX81 Cassette Tape Information for Flight Simulator, The |publisher=Zx81stuff.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> It was also marketed as '''''Flug-Simulation''''' in Germany<ref name='stuff_german'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/info.php?path=/zx81&sub=inlays&root=FlugSimulation&file=.Cover.jpg|title=ZX81 tape Flug-Simulation by Sinclair Research}}</ref> and '''''Simulador De Vuelo''''' in Spain.<ref name ='spectrumcomputing'>{{cite web|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=0001797|title=Flight Simulation|accessdate=2021-04-24}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The program simulated the essential aspects of "a highly-manoeuvrable light aircraft"<ref name='stuff_advert'>{{cite web|url=http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/showmag.php?mag=SinclairUser/Issue004/Pages/SinclairUser00400054.jpg |title=Magazine Page Scan from World of Spectrum |publisher=Zx81stuff.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> in flight.<ref name='stuff_general'>{{cite web|url=http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/generated/tapeinfo/f/FlightSimulation.html |title=ZX81 Cassette Tape Information for Flight Simulation |publisher=Zx81stuff.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> Despite the limitations of the ZX81, it offered a basic graphical view of the instrumentation and view through the front window, as well as navigational aids<ref name='stuff_advert' /> and a full-perspective moving view of the final runway approach.<ref name='stuff_frontcover'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/info.php?path=/zx81&sub=inlays&root=FlightSimulation&file=.Cover.jpg|title = ZX81 tape Flight Simulation by Sinclair Research}}</ref>

==Reception==
The ZX81 version received positive reviews. ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' said "No words can do justice to this most elegant of programs ... You will not see a better computer game till Psion produce one for the Spectrum".<ref name='wos_frontscan'>ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-inlays/f/FlightSimulation.jpg{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name='icemark_inlay'>{{Cite web |url=http://icemark.net/zx/SSD-III/servlet/ssd/title/exact/Flight%20Simulation/instructions |title=SSD: Flight Simulation (Instructions) |access-date=2012-06-13 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130221154228/http://icemark.net/zx/SSD-III/servlet/ssd/title/exact/Flight%20Simulation/instructions |archive-date=2013-02-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ZX Computing called the program "superb", stating that it made "very good use of the power and the graphics of the ZX81".<ref name='wos_zxc_2'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ZXComputing/Issue8210/Pages/ZXComputing821000074.jpg|title=ZX Computing}}</ref>

The ZX Spectrum version also received good reviews at the time of its release in early 1983. Tony Bridge of ''Popular Computing Weekly'' said the program "the best of its type" and that the Spectrum version was even more stunning than the original.<ref name='pcw3383'>{{cite magazine |title=Sinclair's Little Mascot|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly |volume=2|issue=9 |publisher=Sunshine Publications |date=3 March 1983|page=12|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2744&page=12|author=Tony Bridge|access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref> Malcolm Jay of ''ZX Computing'' said the program was superb but complained about the limited instructions, suggesting "would-be Spectrum pilots should obtain a book on flying from their local library".<ref name='wos_zxc_1'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ZXComputing/Issue8306/Pages/ZXComputing830600042.jpg|title=ZX Computing}}</ref> Eight years later [[Your Sinclair]] magazine considered that it had not dated well.<ref name='ys'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue58/Pages/YourSinclair5800029.jpg|title = Your Sinclair}}</ref>
