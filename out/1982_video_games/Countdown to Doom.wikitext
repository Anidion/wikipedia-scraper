'''''Countdown to Doom''''' is a [[text adventure]] game written by [[Peter Killworth]] for the [[BBC Micro]] and published by [[Acornsoft]] in 1982. It is set on the planet Doomawangara, which is coyly shortened to "Doom". An [[Acorn Electron]] version was released in 1984 but only as a [[ROM cartridge]] for the [[Acorn Electron#Acorn Plus 1|Plus 1]] expansion. This was the only game released exclusively as a ROM cart for the Electron.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} There are two sequels, both published by [[Topologika]]: ''Return to Doom'' and ''Last Days of Doom''.

Topologika rereleased ''Countdown to Doom'' in 1987, expanding the scope of the game by about 50%. It was published for the BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, [[ZX Spectrum]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Amstrad PCW]], [[Atari ST]], and [[RM Nimbus]]. A [[RISC OS]] version was published in a compilation with ''Return to Doom'' and ''Philosopher's Quest''.

==Plot==
The player's spaceship crash-lands on Doom's inhospitable surface and they emerge from the wreckage to realise that, unless they can locate the necessary spare parts, their ship will corrode away in a mere 400 time units.
