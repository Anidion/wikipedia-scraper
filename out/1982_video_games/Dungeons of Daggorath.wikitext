'''''Dungeons of Daggorath''''' is one of the first [[real-time game|real-time]], [[first person (video games)|first-person perspective]] [[role-playing video game]]s. It was produced by DynaMicro for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] in 1983. A sequel, '''''Castle of Tharoggad''''', was released in 1988.

==Gameplay==
''Dungeons of Daggorath'' was one of the first games that attempted to portray three-dimensional space in a real-time environment, using angled lines to give the illusion of depth. It followed the 1974 games ''[[Maze War]]'' and ''[[Spasim]]'', written for research computers, and the first 3D maze game for home computers, ''[[3D Monster Maze]]'', released in 1981. The game ''[[Phantom Slayer (computer game)|Phantom Slayer]]'', which was released in 1982 for the Color Computer, also featured monsters lurking in a maze. While ''Daggorath'' was visually similar to these games, it added several elements of strategy, such as different kinds of monsters, complex mazes, different levels of visibility, and the use of different objects and weapons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lcurtisboyle.com/nitros9/dungeonsofdaggorath.html|title=Dungeons of Daggorath|last=Boyle|first=L.

The white bar shows a leather shield in the left hand and a wooden sword in the right hand, and indicates the player's heartbeat. Note the sword on the floor, which can be picked up by the player or other creatures.]]

The player moves around a dungeon, issuing commands by means of typing – for example, typing "GET LEFT SHIELD" or "USE RIGHT" (or abbreviations such as "G L SH" and "U R"), gathering strength and ever more powerful weapons as the game progresses. Various creatures appear, and can often be heard when they are nearby, even when not visible. The object of the game is to defeat the second of two wizards, who is on the fifth and last level of the dungeon.

A unique feature of the game is a heartbeat which rises as the player moves, takes actions or takes damage within the virtual environment. The heartbeat is a direct predecessor of the "health" indicator in later games; the higher the heart rate, the more vulnerable the player is to attack. The player can faint from overexertion, in which case there is the risk of being attacked while defenseless. This heartbeat system was used instead of numerical [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] such as [[hit points]] or [[Health (gaming)|vitality]], and was inspired by [[arcade game]]s,<ref>{{Cite book|first=Matt|last=Barton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMXu61GbTqMC |title=Dungeons & Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games |publisher=[[A K Peters, Ltd.]] |year=2008 |access-date=2010-09-08 |isbn = 978-1-56881-411-7 | pages=80–1}}</ref> specifically 1978's ''[[Space Invaders]]'' where a heartbeat-like sound gradually increases pace as enemies advance towards the player.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_bFdsP9L7oC&pg=PA232|title=Vintage games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|author=Loguidice|first=Bill|last2=Barton|first2=Matt|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-240-81146-8|page=232|access-date=2011-05-01}}</ref>

==Development==
The game was developed by Douglas J. Morgan and Keith S. Kiyohara, with sounds by Phil Landmeier, in 1980–81 for the [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]] ([[RadioShack]]) [[TRS-80 Color Computer]]. Produced by DynaMicro, it was released in 1983 as an eight [[kilobyte]] ROMpak [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] for the Color Computer, which took several months of recoding to achieve. Despite this, the game features a multi-level [[maze]] and has what for the time were advanced sound effects that provide important clues to the locations of monsters.<ref name="Armchair">{{Cite web|url=http://www.armchairarcade.com/neo/node/900|title=A Review of DynaMicro's The Dungeons of Daggorath (1983)|last=Barton|first=Matt|date=13 October 2006|website=Armchair Arcade|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524001705/http://www.armchairarcade.com/neo/node/900|archive-date=24 May 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

Around 2001, Douglas J. Morgan noticed that the [[Exclusive rights|exclusive]] copyright had reverted to him from the publisher [[RadioShack]]. He released the game under a [[freeware]]-like license to the public, also offering the [[source code]] for a small fee.<ref name="Armchair" /><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100911232420/http://frodpod.tripod.com/lisence.html Grant of license to reproduce Dungeons of Daggorath] by Douglas J.

''Dungeons of Daggorath'' was featured in the book ''[[Ready Player One]]'', where the protagonist has to solve the game, emulated within a simulated universe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geekdad.com/2018/04/the-video-games-of-ready-player-one/|title=The Video Games of 'Ready Player One'|last=Owens|first=Skip|date=9 April 2018|website=Geek Dad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204164710/https://geekdad.com/2018/04/the-video-games-of-ready-player-one/|archive-date=4 February 2019|url-status=live|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> The plot point does not appear in [[Ready Player One (film)|its film adaptation]].

The game's artwork was used also for the [[Oneohtrix Point Never]] album ''[[Garden of Delete]]'', which is an edit from a screenshot of the game.
