==Reception==
William Edmunds reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The ''Pursuit of the Graf Spee'' is a good intermediate level war game. It combines a strategic game, its anguish of unsuccessful searching, with tactical battles which can produce the thrill of battle when you're finally closing in for the kill. This game characterizes many of the aspects of naval combat while being fast paced and easy to play."<ref name="CGW5">{{cite magazine |last=Edmunds |first=William |title=Pursuit of the Graf Spee: A Review |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=July–August 1982 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=18–19}}</ref>
