'''''Baja Buggies''''' is a desert-themed [[racing game|racing video game]] written by Dan Ugrin for [[Atari 8-bit computers]].<ref name=mania/> It uses a third-person, [[2.5D]] perspective. The game was originally developed and sold as '''''Night Rally''''' by Arcade Plus before the company folded, then it was revamped and became the first release from Gamestar.<ref name=kunkel/><ref name=analog/> Gamestar went on to publish a series of sports games for the Atari 8-bit and [[Commodore 64]] before becoming a label of [[Activision]].

==Gameplay==

''Baja Buggies'' is an [[off-road racing|off-road race]] through the desert against 80 opponents Most of the racers are anonymous. The top three have names that play on those of real drivers, such as "A. J. Cactus" (similar to [[A. J. Foyt]]). The game displays the player's current rank, and a radar shows relative position to the  race leaders. The goal is to finish in the top six. The joystick steers left and right and the button applies the brakes. Acceleration is automatic. The race ends when the last car of the leading group finishes–or if the player crashes too many times.

There are three courses: beginner, pro, and a random course that's also classified as pro-level.<ref name=manual/>

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' favorably compared ''Baja Buggies'' to Sega's ''[[Turbo (video game)|Turbo]]'', but found the audio to be simplistic and disliked the lack of support for [[Paddle (game controller)|paddle controllers]].<ref name=efun/> Marc Benioff, reviewing the game for ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'', wrote "It has some similarities to ''Turbo'' by Sega, but is not a copy."<ref name=benioff/> ''[[Page 6]]'' wrote, "What makes ''Baja Buggies'' special is the unique 3-D perspective as you drive toward the distant mountains. When you turn a corner, you really do turn–the mountains and sky scroll across and you feel as if you are really in the car."<ref name=page6/>

The reviewer for ''The Book of Atari Software 1983'' found the game became boring in long stretches without seeing another vehicle. They also didn't like the game immediately ending once the leading group crosses the finish line and would have preferred to finish the entire race.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Book of Atari Software 1983 |date=1983 |publisher=The Book Company |isbn=0-201-10286-2 |page=114 |url=https://archive.org/details/ataribooks-the-book-of-atari-software-1983/page/n115/mode/2up}}</ref>

''Antic'' concluded, "''Baja Buggies'' is an excellent product. Compared to driving games of the past, this is a programming masterpiece."<ref name= benioff/> In a review for ''[[Electronic Games]]'', Bill Kunkel wrote, "Put flat-out, this is the best racing contest, in terms of graphics and game play, ever designed for a computer system."<ref name=kunkel/> Several years after release ''Atari Explorer'' called it, "the first computer program to seriously court the favor of race car fans".<ref name=aexp/>
