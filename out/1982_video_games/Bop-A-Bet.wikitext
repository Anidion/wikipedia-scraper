This is a maze game where you steer a boxing glove using four keys. You bop letter in alphabetical order by pushing the space bar and if you bop them out of sequence nothing happens. The object is to bop as many as you can within a time limit. When you boot the disk, there are some questions that let you change the time limit, the speed of the bopper, the keys used, and choose upper or lower case. This part requires an older person who can read but once started, four or five year-olds will have no trouble.''</ref>

==Reception==
Bob Proctor reviewed four educational games for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "In terms of simplicity, three of these four games can be used by the age groups for which they were intended. ''Bop-A-Bet'' would also qualify except for those questions at the start which set up the game. However, you also have to ask yourself if your children (or students) can be entrusted with the only copy of a $30 to $40 disk."<ref name="CGW9">{{cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |title=The Learning Game |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Mar–Apr 1983 |volume=1 |issue=9 |pages=36–37}}</ref>
