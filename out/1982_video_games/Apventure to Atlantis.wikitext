'''''Apventure to Atlantis''''' is the sequel to ''[[Odyssey: The Compleat Apventure]]'' written by Bob Clardy and published by [[Synergistic Software]] in 1982.

==Gameplay==
This is a sequel to ''[[Odyssey: The Compleat Apventure]]'' whose story picks up with the player as ruler of this island and updates the format of the game to include internal areas displayed in the form of the then-current ''[[Mystery House]]'' game, and also incorporated a parser that allowed the use of  [[text adventure]]-style commands.

==Reception==
''[[Softalk]]'' said "''Atlantis'' is a worthy successor to its progenitor; preserving many of the original's noblest achievements and adding refinements that in turn promise even greater things in future Apventures."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Marketalk Reviews |magazine=Softalk |volume=2 |issue=10|url=https://archive.org/details/softalkv2n10jun1982/page/n119/mode/2up |publisher=Softalk Publishing |date=June 1982}}</ref>

''[[Creative Computing]]'' said "The game has sound, color, animation, excitement, and – for when you're really stuck – a hint sheet. If you find static adventures boring, try this one."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Stocking Stuffers |magazine=Creative Computing Magazine |volume=3 |issue=12 |url=https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1982-12/page/n69/mode/2up |date=December 1982}}</ref>

The 1984 Software Encyclopedia from ''[[Electronic Games]]'' rated the game an 8 out of 10 and said "Colorful, animated visuals decorate this entertaining cross between action adventures and arcade-style games."<ref>{{cite web |title=1984 Software Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/RetroGameMagazineOneShots/1984%20Software%20Encyclopedia%20%281983%29%20Over%20900%20Descriptions%20and%20Ratings/page/n7/mode/2up |language=English |date=1983}}</ref>
