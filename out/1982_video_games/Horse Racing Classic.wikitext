==Gameplay==

==Reception==
Barry Austin reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''HRC'' is a good horse racing simulation, a good teaching tool, and just a darn good party game. There have been several horse race games written for the Apple (most were little more than lo-res programming exercises), but ''HRC'' stands apart."<ref name="CGW5">{{cite magazine |last=Austin |first=Barry |title=Horseracing Classic: A Review |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Julyâ€“August 1982 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=23}}</ref>
