{{nihongo foot|'''''Zaxxon'''''|ザクソン|Zakuson|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[scrolling shooter]] developed and released by [[Sega]] as an [[arcade video game]] in 1982.<ref name=":0" /> The player pilots a ship through heavily defended space fortresses. Japanese electronics company [[Ikegami Tsushinki]] was also involved in the game's development.<ref name=":0">{{Nihongo|It started from Pong|それは『ポン』から始まった : アーケードTVゲームの成り立ち|sore wa pon kara hajimatta: ākēdo terebi gēmu no naritachi}}, {{Nihongo|Masumi Akagi|赤木真澄|Akagi Masumi}}, {{Nihongo|Amusement Tsūshinsha|アミューズメント通信社|Amyūzumento Tsūshinsha}}, 2005, {{ISBN|4-9902512-0-2}}.</ref><ref name="Akagi" />

''Zaxxon'' was the first [[Isometric graphics in video games|game to employ axonometric projection]], which lent its name to the game (''AXXON'' from ''AXON''ometric projection).

Sega released an arcade sequel, ''Super Zaxxon'', in 1982 and the ''Zaxxon''-like shooter ''Future Spy'' in 1984.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Zaxxon.png|thumb|left|The Zaxxon robot at the end of the second fortress]]

The objective of the game is to hit as many targets as possible without being shot down or running out of fuel—which can be replenished by blowing up fuel drums (300 points).<ref>[http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=12757 ''Zaxxon''] from the [[Killer List of Videogames]] (KLOV)</ref> There are two fortresses to fly through, with an outer space segment between them. At the end of the second fortress is a [[boss (video games)|boss]] in the form of the Zaxxon robot.

The player's ship casts a shadow to indicate its height.<ref name=Perron>Bernard Perron & Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), ''Video game theory reader two'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=oe0zNalKkTgC&pg=PA158 p. 158] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225100100/http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oe0zNalKkTgC&pg=PA158 |date=2015-02-25 }}, [[Taylor & Francis]], {{ISBN|0-415-96282-X}}</ref> An [[altimeter]] is also displayed; in space there is nothing for the ship to cast a shadow on.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Art of Video Games: From Pac-Man to Mass Effect|year=2012|publisher=Welcome Books|isbn=978-1-59962-110-4|pages=28–9|url=http://boingboing.net/2012/03/16/the-art-of-video-games-from-p.html/aovg_28_lr|author=Chris Melissinos|author2=Elizabeth Broun|access-date=17 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712151730/http://boingboing.net/2012/03/16/the-art-of-video-games-from-p.html/aovg_28_lr|archive-date=2012-07-12|url-status=live}}</ref> The walls at the entrance and exit of each fortress have openings that the ship must be at the right altitude to pass through. Within each fortress are additional walls that the ship's shadow and altimeter aid in flying over successfully.

The game is controlled by a four-directional joystick. On arcade cabinets this is an aircraft-type stick with a molded hand grip. Pushing forward makes the player's aircraft lower in altitude and pulling back makes it rise. The aircraft cannot move forward or backward; it flies at constant speed. As this sort of control and movement was not common in video games, the arcade cabinets have illustrations around the joystick to indicate the effect of each position on the aircraft.

Between 1982 and 1985, ''Zaxxon'' was ported to the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[MSX]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Dragon 32]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Intellivision]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[SG-1000]], [[TRS-80 Color Computer]], and [[TRS-80]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATAEAAAAMBAJ&q=zaxxon&pg=PA37 |title=InfoWorld Jan. 1983 |access-date=2017-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014083456/https://books.google.de/books?id=ATAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=zaxxon |archive-date=2017-10-14 |url-status=live |date=1983-01-31 }}</ref> The Atari 2600 and Intellivision ports use a third-person, behind-the-ship perspective instead of the isometric graphics of the other versions.

=== Commercial ===
The arcade game was a major commercial success in North America. ''Zaxxon'' reached the top of the monthly US ''RePlay'' arcade charts in June 1982.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=RePlay: The Players' Choice |magazine=RePlay |date=June 1982}}</ref> The Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) later listed it among the top six highest-grossing [[1982 in video games|arcade games of 1982]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=AMOA Announces Jukebox and Games Awards Winners |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=30 October 1982 |page=37 |url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox44unse_20/page/37 }}</ref>

The ColecoVision version was also commercially successful. ''Zaxxon'' was Coleco's best-selling non-bundled cartridge for the ColecoVision up until 1983.<ref name="VGP" />

The home computer ports were commercially successful in North America and Europe.

=== Reviews ===
The arcade game was well received upon release. David Cohen in his book ''Video Games'' praised the "incredible three-dimensional realism" in the graphics, which he considered the best in a video game to date, while describing the gameplay as "a mixture of driving and zap game."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Daniel |title=Video Games |date=1982 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |location=New York |isbn=0-671-45872-8 |page=43 |url=https://archive.org/details/book_video_games/page/n49}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' praised the game for being "at the frontier of a third dimension in arcade games" and for its "realistic" altitude-based gameplay for the time.<ref name="CVG10">{{cite magazine |title=The 3D space fortress: Zaxxon |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=July 1982 |issue=10 (August 1982) |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=UK |page=26 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/167/456}}</ref>

''Zaxxon'' is a bonus game in the ''[[Sega Genesis Collection]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]]. It is also an unlockable arcade game in ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]].

=== Sequels ===
''Zaxxon'' was followed by an arcade sequel in November 1982: ''Super Zaxxon''.<ref name="Akagi" /> It has a different color scheme, the player's ship flies faster (making the game more difficult), the space segment is replaced with a tunnel, and the enemy at the end of the second fortress is a dragon. It did not do as well as the original. ''Super Zaxxon'' topped the US ''RePlay'' arcade chart for software conversion kits in [[1983 in video games|July 1983]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=RePlay: The Players' Choice |magazine=RePlay |date=July 1983}}</ref> In 1984, Sega released ''Future Spy'' with a similar style.<ref>{{cite web |title=Future Spy |url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=future-spy&page=detail&id=890 |website=Arcade History}}</ref>

In 1987 ''[[Zaxxon 3-D]]'' was released for the [[Master System]]. This console variation makes use of the [[3-D glasses]] add-on. As with the Atari 2600 and Intellivision ports, it is forward-scrolling rather than isometric.

''[[Zaxxon's Motherbase 2000]]'' was released for the [[Sega 32X]] in 1995. It is the first ''Zaxxon'' game to incorporate [[polygon graphics]]. The game bore the ''Zaxxon'' brand only in the United States, as the Japanese version was named ''Parasquad'' and the European version was named ''Motherbase''. U.S. gaming critics generally remarked that the game was not similar enough to ''Zaxxon'' to justify the use of the brand.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Zaxxon's Motherbase 2000|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=82|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=July 1995|page=46}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Review Crew: Zaxxon's Motherbase 2000|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=71|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 1995|page=36}}</ref>

''Zaxxon Escape'' was released on October 4, 2012, for iOS and Android devices.
