==Reception==
Chris Smith reviewed ''Theseus and the Minotaur'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 57.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Smith |first=Chris |date=November 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=57|pages=32}}</ref> Smith commented that "Overall, this is a good game. The maze is different every time, though I can find no real difference between a complexity 1 and a complexity 100 game (they give you a choice at the beginning of each game). If the mental challenge of finding the secret doors and mapping out the labyrinth despite the halls of mirrors appeals to you, then I recommend this game."<ref name="SG"/>
