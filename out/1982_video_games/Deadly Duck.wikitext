==Gameplay==
[[File:Deadly_Duck_Screenshot.png|thumb|left|250px|Gameplay screenshot]]
Cranky crabs are attempting to get the ducks out of their ponds. The crabs fly in the air while throwing bricks and bombs at the ducks. To fight back, the ducks are armed with a bill that is also a gun barrel that shoots a limitless supply of bullets straight up.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deadly Duck|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/atari2600/584671-deadly-duck|website=GameFAQs|accessdate=5 October 2013}}</ref>

The player starts with four lives and a bonus life is awarded when all eight crabs in a level have been shot. If the player is hit by a brick, a life is lost. When bricks land at the bottom of the play area they impede player movement for a temporary period.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://atariage.com/manual_page.html?SystemID=2600&SoftwareLabelID=124&maxPages=6&currentPage=2 |title=Deadly Duck - Atari 2600 - 20th Century Fox |website=Atari Age |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525160106/http://www.atariage.com/manual_page.html?SystemID=2600&SoftwareLabelID=124&maxPages=6&currentPage=2 |archive-date=2005-05-25}} </ref>
