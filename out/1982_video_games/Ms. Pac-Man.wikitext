{{nihongo foot|'''''Ms. Pac-Man'''''|ミズ・パックマン|Mizu Pakku Man|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1982 [[maze video game|maze]] [[arcade video game]] developed by [[General Computer Corporation]] and published by [[Midway Games|Midway]]. It is a spin-off sequel to ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980) and the first entry in the series to not be made by [[Namco]]. Controlling the [[Ms. Pac-Man (character)|title character]], [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]]'s wife, the player is tasked with eating all of the pellets in an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|ghosts]]. Eating the larger "power pellets" lets the player eat the ghosts, who turn blue and flee.

General Computer made the game as a modification kit for the original ''Pac-Man'', titled ''Crazy Otto''. However, due to previous legal action with [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]], GCC was forced to present the project to Midway, the North American distributor of ''Pac-Man''. Midway purchased the project and enlisted GCC to use the game as a basis for the sequel to ''Pac-Man''. Multiple names were considered for the game, including ''Miss Pac-Man'' and ''Mrs. Pac-Man'', before the final name was chosen for being easier to pronounce. While development had started without Namco's consent, company president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] was brought in and provided feedback on the player character's design. The company ultimately collected the same royalties on each cabinet as they had with ''Pac-Man''.

''Ms. Pac-Man'' was acclaimed by critics for its improvements to the original gameplay and for having a female protagonist; some have described it as superior to ''Pac-Man''. It has been listed among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]] and as one of the most successful American arcade games ever made.<ref>{{cite news|last=Beamish|first=Graeme|title=Pellet-popping power: Pac-Man turns 30 today|url=http://www2.canada.com/nanaimodailynews/news/entertainment/story.html?id=41d195fe-ecbf-446f-bb2d-c629457e161f|access-date=5 March 2012|newspaper=Nanaimo Daily News|date=May 22, 2010|agency=[[Postmedia News|Canwest News Service]]|archive-date=14 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014183100/http://www2.canada.com/nanaimodailynews/news/entertainment/story.html?id=41d195fe-ecbf-446f-bb2d-c629457e161f|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's success inspired a variety of successful merchandise, several ports for numerous home consoles and handheld systems, a television cartoon that included Pac-Man, and numerous video game sequels and remakes that spawned a ''Ms. Pac-Man'' video game spin-off series. The rights to the game are owned by Namco's successor company, [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]]. However, the game and its title character have suffered various legal ownership issues between Namco and General Computer Corporation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ms-pac-man-is-being-replaced-and-its-likely-due-to-a-legal-dispute/1100-6502364/ | title=Ms. Pac-Man is Being Replaced, and It's Likely Due to a Legal Dispute }}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Mspacman.png|thumb|left |Start of the game]]

The gameplay is very similar to that of ''Pac-Man''. The player earns points by eating pellets and avoiding ghosts (contact with one causes [[Ms. Pac-Man (character)|Ms. Pac-Man]] to lose a life). Eating an energizer (or "power pellet") causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be eaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds increase, the speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the duration of the ghosts' vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether.

===Differences from ''Pac-Man''===
* The game has four mazes that appear in different color schemes and alternate after each of the game's intermissions are seen. The pink maze appears in levels one and two; the light blue maze appears in levels three, four, and five; the brown maze appears in levels six to nine; and the dark blue maze appears in levels 10 to 14. After level 14, the maze configurations alternate every fourth level.
* The first, second, and fourth mazes have two sets of [[Wraparound (video games)|warp tunnels]], as opposed to only one in the original maze.
* The walls have a solid color rather than an outline, which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are.
* The orange ghost is called Sue, rather than Clyde; her color was later changed to purple in ''[[Pac-Land]]'' to differentiate her.
* The ghosts' behavioral patterns are different, and include semi-random movement, which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round. Blinky (red) and Pinky (pink) move randomly in the first several seconds of each level, until the first reversal. Inky (cyan) and Sue (orange) still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners, again until the first reversal.
* Instead of appearing in the center of the maze, the fruits bounce around the maze, entering and (if not eaten) leaving through the warp tunnels. Once all fruit has been encountered, they appear in random sequence for the rest of the game, starting on the eighth round; a 5000-point banana can be followed by a 100-point pair of cherries.
* When Ms. Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost and dies, she spins around, or as the back of the flier says, "she dramatically swoons and falls"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ms. Pac-Man |url=http://psx-scene.com/forums/attachments/f346/51939d1399004633-retroxmb-art-collection-icon1-pam-snd0-at3-icon0-png-pic1-png-more-mspacman.zip.png |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420122027/http://psx-scene.com/forums/attachments/f346/51939d1399004633-retroxmb-art-collection-icon1-pam-snd0-at3-icon0-png-pic1-png-more-mspacman.zip.png |archive-date=2015-04-20 |access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref> rather than folding in on herself as the original Pac-Man did.
* The three intermissions follow the developing relationship between the original [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]] and Ms. Pac-Man (from when they first meet to having a [[stork]] drop off their baby). The latter served as the basis for ''[[Baby Pac-Man]]'' and is referenced in ''[[Jr. Pac-Man]]''.
* The slowdown applied to the ghosts in the warp tunnels only applies for the first three rounds in this game.
* The sound effects and music are all new.

==Development==
''Ms. Pac-Man'' was originally conceived as an enhancement kit for ''Pac-Man'' called ''Crazy Otto'', created by programmers employed at the [[General Computer Corporation]] (GCC).<ref name="klov2">{{Cite web |url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8782 |title=Ms. Pac-Man Videogame by Midway (1981) - The International Arcade Museum and the KLOV |access-date=2007-10-11 |archive-date=2007-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225928/http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8782 |url-status=live }}</ref> While ''Crazy Otto'' was under development, GCC settled a lawsuit with [[Atari, Inc.]] over their ''[[Missile Command]]'' conversion kit ''Super Missile Attack''. Part of the settlement terms barred GCC from selling future conversion kits without consent from the original game manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhM8NAMW_VQ |title=Game Developers' Conference Post-Mortem by original developer Steve Golson |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2017-01-14 |archive-date=2017-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325180403/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhM8NAMW_VQ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Rather than scrapping ''Crazy Otto'' entirely, the programmers chose to present the completed game to Midway, [[Namco]]'s American distributor of ''Pac-Man''. Midway was enthusiastic that such a game had come to their attention, as they were hoping to capitalize on the success of ''Pac-Man'' with a sequel. They bought the rights to ''Crazy Otto'' and worked with GCC and Namco to prepare the game for release. In final development, the game's name and characters experienced multiple changes. [[Sprite (computer graphics)|Sprites]], text and minor game elements were altered to better reflect the ''Pac-Man'' series.

The game was initially titled ''Super Pac-Man'', containing [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]] as the lead character. Inspired by the cutscenes of ''Crazy Otto'', featuring Crazy Otto's female counterpart, the lead character was made female and the game was renamed ''Pac-Woman''. That name was dropped in favor of ''Miss Pac-Man'', but the developers then realized that, given the third intermission showing a stork delivering a baby to Pac-Man and the player's character, confusion could arise about their relationship. In light of this, the name was changed to ''Mrs. Pac-Man'', and then finally to ''Ms. Pac-Man'', which rolled off the tongue more easily. Programmer Steve Golson said: "In the span of just two weeks, it went from ''Crazy Otto'' to ''Super Pac-Man'' to ''Miss Pac-Man''."<ref name="35th">{{cite news |last1=Edwards |first1=Benj |title=The MIT Dropouts Who Created Ms. Pac-Man: A 35th-Anniversary Oral History |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3067296/the-mit-dropouts-who-created-ms-pac-man-a-35th-anniversary-oral-history |access-date=8 February 2021 |work=Fast Company |agency=Fast Company, Inc. |publisher=Mansueto Ventures |date=February 3, 2017 |archive-date=15 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615004912/https://www.fastcompany.com/3067296/the-mit-dropouts-who-created-ms-pac-man-a-35th-anniversary-oral-history |url-status=live }}</ref> These later changes (''Miss'', ''Mrs.'', and ''Ms.'') all occurred within 72 hours of actual production.<ref>[[The Ultimate History of Video Games]] by [[Steven L. Kent]], pp. 171-172</ref>

Shortly before release, Stan Jarocki of Midway stated that ''Ms. Pac-Man'' was conceived in part as a response to the original ''Pac-Man'' being "the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players," and that it was "our way of thanking all those lady arcaders who have played and enjoyed ''Pac-Man''."<ref name="worley198205">{{Cite magazine |last=Worley |first=Joyce |date=May 1982 |title=Women Join the Arcade Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_03_1982-05_Reese_Communications_US/page/n29 |magazine=Electronic Games |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=30–33 [33] |access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> According to one 1982 estimate, a majority of ''Pac-Man'' players were women.<ref name="howtowin">{{Cite book |title=How to Win Video Games |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1982 |isbn=0-671-45841-8 |page=87 | url=https://archive.org/stream/book_how_to_win_video_games#page/n87/mode/2up}}</ref> This is corroborated by marketing chief Michael Leone of the Castle Park Entertainment Center, who noted that his company "noticed a recent trend in our game pavilions that indicates a tremendous female acceptance of the ''Pac-Man'' game", further noting that it "was only natural for Midway...to introduce a Ms. Pac-Man."<ref name= "Goldstein">{{cite news |last1=Goldstein |first1=Patrick |title=Why is Pac-Man Grinning?

GCC co-founder Doug Macrae noted that [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]], Namco's president at the time, gave him direct feedback on the Ms. Pac-Man character.<ref name="macrae">{{Cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/15532555 |title=Doug Macrae from GCC speaks at California Extreme 2010 |access-date=2010-11-07 |archive-date=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806124147/http://vimeo.com/15532555 |url-status=live }}</ref> In an interview, Macrae said: "We sent out ROMs to Midway, and they sent them over to Japan for the President of Namco, Masaya Nakamura, to look at. He said: 'Love the concept, get rid of the hair.'" He added: "There was a little bit of embarrassment [at Namco] of the fact that the sequel was being done somewhere other than in their own laboratories. ...The arrangement that Namco had with Midway was that Namco would still get their royalty on ''Ms. Pac-Man''...and Midway could choose to do whatever they wanted in paying us a royalty in addition to Namco."<ref name="macrae" />

[[Toru Iwatani]], the creator of ''Pac-Man'', is not known to have publicly commented on ''Ms. Pac-Man'', despite questions from reporters.<ref name="35th" />

==Ownership==
The GCC group agreed on October 29, 1981, to give the rights to ''Ms. Pac-Man'' to Midway in exchange for royalty payments for the game's sale. At the time, Midway held the license from Namco for distribution of ''Pac-Man'' games, advertising, and merchandise in North America. After the game became wildly successful, Midway and GCC undertook a legal battle concerning merchandise royalties before ultimately reaching a settlement in 1983. This settlement stated that GCC members would be paid royalties by Midway for usage of Ms. Pac-Man in commercial contexts.<ref name="pal">{{cite news |last1=Parish |first1=Jeremy |title=Remembering Pac & Pal, Pac-Man's Strangest Arcade Adventure |url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/weekly-classic-pacpal |access-date=8 February 2021 |work=US Gamer |agency=Gamer Network Limited |publisher=ReedPOP |date=July 23, 2013 |archive-date=23 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123175821/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/weekly-classic-pacpal |url-status=live }}</ref>

Namco (now [[Bandai Namco]]) made an additional agreement with the GCC stakeholders in 2008. While Bandai Namco does control the Ms. Pac-Man copyright and intellectual property, some royalty rights and obligations are unresolved.<ref name="Polygon">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/26/20886032/ms-pac-man-lawsuit-bandai-namco-atgames-rights-royalties | title = AtGames, sued by Ms. Pac-Man's owner, buys up royalty rights to the icon | first = Owen S. | last = Good | date = September 26, 2019 | access-date = September 26, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-date = September 27, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190927003419/https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/26/20886032/ms-pac-man-lawsuit-bandai-namco-atgames-rights-royalties | url-status = live }}</ref>

===AtGames dispute===
In August 2019, [[AtGames]], a company that specializes in [[microconsole]]s featuring older arcade games, acquired the royalties owed to GCC.<ref name="Polygon"/> AtGames had initially approached the GCC group members about licensing ''Ms. Pac-Man'' for potential products. Bandai Namco, on learning that AtGames had been seeking these rights for a possible mini-arcade game, filed a lawsuit against AtGames alleging that AtGames misrepresented itself as licensed to make ''Ms. Pac-Man'' products, and created ''Ms. Pac-Man'' mini-cabinets under those claims. It also alleged false advertising, unfair competition, and copyright infringement.<ref name="Polygon"/>

The case was ultimately [[Voluntary dismissal|dismissed with prejudice]] on October 27, 2020, following a request by Bandai Namco. Presiding Judge [[Vince Chhabria]] stated that "all involved parties [had] resolved the case of their own accord."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jennings |first1=Collier |title=Bandai Namco's Arcade Blast!

Beginning with the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' release of ''[[Pac-Land]]'' in 2022, the Ms. Pac-Man character has been removed from games which previously featured her. In her place is a new character known as Pac-Mom, who also replaces her in the ''[[Pac-Man Museum+]]'' versions of ''Pac-Land'', ''[[Pac-In-Time]]'' and ''[[Pac-Attack]]'', and in ''[[Pac-Man World#Remake|Pac-Man World Re-Pac]]'', a remake of ''[[Pac-Man World]]''. Bandai Namco has not given an official reason for the change, but news outlets have assumed that it was done to avoid legal problems with AtGames.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-27 |title=Pac-Man's Family All Have VERY Different Names In Pac-Man Museum+ |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/pac-mans-family-all-have-very-different-names-in-pac-man-museumplus |access-date=2022-05-28 |website=Nintendo Life |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-07 |title=Random: Where's Ms. Pac-Man In Pac-Land? |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/04/random-wheres-ms-pac-man-in-pac-land |access-date=2022-05-28 |website=Nintendo Life |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |author1=Rich Stanton |date=2022-04-08 |title=Ms. Pac-Man is being written-out of Pac-Man history |language=en |work=PC Gamer |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/ms-pac-man-is-being-written-out-of-pac-man-history/ |access-date=2022-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Good |first=Owen S. |date=2022-04-07 |title=Pac-Man has a new wife, thanks to Ms. Pac-Man drama |url=https://www.polygon.com/23015420/ms-pac-man-pac-land-bandai-namco-atgames-lawsuit |access-date=2022-06-05 |website=Polygon |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Release==
Reporter Patrick Goldstein of the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that the game made its public debut on February 3, 1982 "in typical showbusiness style at a press conference at the Castle Park Entertainment Center in Sherman Oaks." He noted that "[t]he game is expected to appear in many video arcades during the next few weeks."

[[Atari, Inc.]] released versions for the [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[Atari 7800]] and [[Atari 8-bit computers]]. There were also versions for the [[VIC-20]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[TI-99/4A]] released under the [[Atarisoft]] label. Unlike ''Pac-Man'', most home versions of ''Ms. Pac-Man'' include all three intermission screens from the arcade game. The Atari 2600 rendition of ''Pac-Man'' was infamous for its flashing ghosts, while the 2600 port of ''Ms. Pac-Man'' had minimal flicker.

A tabletop version of ''Ms. Pac-Man'' was released in 1983 by [[Coleco]]. The unit was shaped like a miniature arcade cabinet, was controlled with a small built-in joystick, and used a multicolor [[vacuum fluorescent display]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Coleco/MsPacMan.htm |title=Coleco Ms. Pac-Man<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-12-07 |archive-date=2007-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203190453/http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Coleco/MsPacMan.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> It was a runner-up for [[List of Game of the Year awards|Stand-Alone Game of the Year]] at the 1983 [[Electronic Games|Arcade Awards]] held in January 1984.<ref name="eg_archive"/> In 1991, [[Atari Corporation]] released a version for the [[Atari Lynx|Lynx]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Atari Lynx Ms. Pac-Man |url=http://atariage.com/software_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=1902 |website=AtariAge |access-date=2019-01-02 |archive-date=2017-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318052940/https://atariage.com/software_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=1902 |url-status=live }}</ref> introducing new mazes, a fourth intermission and a power-up that gives the player a temporary speed boost.

[[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] released an unlicensed port of the game in 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Namco released their own NES port of ''Ms. Pac-Man'' in North America in November 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/nes_games.pdf#page=9|publisher=Nintendo of America|access-date=November 11, 2023|title=NES Games|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611225644/http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/nes_games.pdf#page=9|archive-date=June 11, 2014}}</ref> The [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], [[Master System]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] versions, by [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]], and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] version, by [[WMS Industries|Williams Entertainment]], took a few liberties. They featured four different sets of mazes: the original arcade mazes, bigger mazes, smaller mazes and "strange" mazes. There was also a Pac-Booster option that let players make Ms. Pac-Man move much faster, which was only available in the original arcade game from a maintenance menu. These versions also allowed two people to play simultaneously, with player 2 as Pac-Man. The game ends at level 32, with an intermission where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man say good-bye. It was released for the [[Game Boy Color]] with two new mazes and a bonus game (''[[Super Pac-Man]]'').

In 2001, Namco released an arcade board with both ''Ms. Pac-Man'' and ''[[Galaga]]'' in honor of the 20th anniversary of both games with the subtitle "20 Year Reunion / Class of 1981". It also features ''[[Pac-Man]]'' as a hidden bonus game. The later 25th Anniversary Edition allows all three games to be selected at the main menu.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/arcade/567437-namco-20-year-reunion-ms-pac-man-galaga-class-of-1981/cheats|title=Namco 20 Year Reunion: Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga - Class of 1981 Cheats, Codes, and Secrets for Arcade Games - GameFAQs|website=gamefaqs.gamespot.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14|archive-date=2018-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614121440/https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/arcade/567437-namco-20-year-reunion-ms-pac-man-galaga-class-of-1981/cheats|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Ms. Pac-Man'' is included in the [[CD-i]] ''[[Arcade Classics (CD-i game)|Arcade Classics]]'' collection (released in [[Europe]], but not in [[North America]]).
