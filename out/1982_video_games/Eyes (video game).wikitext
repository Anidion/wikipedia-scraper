'''''Eyes''''' is a maze shooter [[arcade game]] created by Miami-based developer Digitrex Techstar and published in 1982 by [[Rock-Ola]].<ref name=klov/> It was licensed for the European market by Zaccaria with different cabinet art.<ref name=zacflyer/>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Eyesarcade.png|thumb|right]]

The player controls an eyeball in a maze. As in ''[[Pac-Man]]'' the goal is to collect all of the dots to advance to next level, but in ''Eyes'' the player shoots the dots rather than eating them. Computer-controlled [[eye]]s chase and shoot at the player. Shooting a computer eye gives points and removes it from the level, but it will reappear a short time later. Being shot by a computer eye is fatal.

As the game progresses, more computer eyes are added to levels and they take less time to shoot at the player. They also move faster. There are eight different mazes.<ref name=allin/>
