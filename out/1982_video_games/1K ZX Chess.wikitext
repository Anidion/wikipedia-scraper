'''''1K ZX Chess''''' is a 1982 chess program for the unexpanded [[Sinclair ZX81]].

==Description==
''1K ZX Chess'''s code takes up only 672 bytes in memory,<ref name="horne198302">{{Cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/YourComputer_198302/YourComputer8302#page/n99/mode/2up |title=Full ZX-81 Chess in 1K |last=Horne |first=David |date=February 1983 |work=Your Computer |access-date=5 March 2018 |pages=100–102}}</ref> but implements [[chess]] rules except for [[castling]], [[promotion (chess)|promotion]], and [[en passant]], including a computer opponent.{{r|gilbert198303}} It was the smallest implementation of chess on any computer at the time.
Developer David Horne discussed ''1K ZX Chess'' and published the full [[source code]] as a [[type-in program]] in a series of articles in ''[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]'' in 1982 and 1983.<ref name="horne198212">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/your-computer-magazine-1982-12/YourComputer_1982_12#page/n67/mode/2up | title=Chess in 1K | work=Your Computer | date=December 1982 | accessdate=21 January 2015 | author=Horne, David | pages=68–69}}</ref><ref name="horne198301">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/your-computer-magazine-1983-01/YourComputer_1983_01#page/n79/mode/2up | title=1K Chess | work=Your Computer | date=January 1983 | accessdate=21 January 2015 | author=Horne, David | pages=81, 83}}</ref>{{r|horne198302}}

==Reception==
''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' in 1982 called ''1K ZX Chess'' "one of the most interesting ZX tapes to pass through our office in recent weeks". It approved of the computer displaying moves while considering them and noted "the skills which went into writing a chess program in 1K of machine code. Is there anyone reading this who could even contemplate doing the same?" The magazine concluded, "Despite the limitations this is one cassette, at £3, which I would recommend."<ref name="scot19820715">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/popular-computing-weekly-1982-07-15/PopularComputing_Weekly_Issue_1982-07-15#page/n11/mode/2up | title=1K ZX Chess | work=Popular Computing Weekly | date=1982-07-15 | accessdate=1 February 2015 | author=Scot, Duncan | pages=12}}</ref> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' in 1983 stated that "it takes some technical wizardry to squeeze this kind of game into the unexpanded ZX81". The magazine praised the game's quick loading speed, and found that it "makes its moves very fast for the amount of memory available for it".<ref name="gilbert198303">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-012/SinclairUser_012_Mar_1983#page/n61/mode/2up | title=Sinclair acts to improve the standard of its named software | work=Sinclair User | date=March 1983 | accessdate=28 January 2015 | author=Gilbert, John | pages=62–63}}</ref> ''Home Computing Weekly'' gave the game three out of five stars, criticizing the confusing user interface but stating that "it still produces play which needs some thought to beat".<ref name="elder19830308">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/home-computing-weekly-001/Home_Computing_Weekly_001#page/n21/mode/2up | title=Which ZX81 programs are best? | work=Home Computing Weekly | date=1983-03-08 | accessdate=1 February 2015 | author=Elder, Ray | pages=21–22}}</ref> [[Tim Harding (chess player)|Tim Harding]] wrote in a 1985 book on computer chess that "the man who did it must be some sort of genius".

''1K ZX Chess'' came in second place for best software in a poll of ZX81 users. ''Retrogaming Times Monthly'' described it as "history's greatest game programming feat";<ref name="sabbatini200901">{{cite news | url=http://my.stratos.net/~hewston95/RTM56/RTM56.html#ZX81 | title=The Thrill of Defeat: Catching the 1k Bug | work=Retrogames Times Monthly | date=January 2009 | accessdate=21 January 2015 | author=Sabbatini, Mark}}</ref> [[Kuro5hin]] agreed, calling ''1K ZX Chess'' "the greatest program ever written". ''BootChess'' author Olivier Poudade praised ''1K ZX Chess''{{'}}s code, stating that at first writing a smaller chess program "seemed impossible ... Horne had nailed it so much already". Poudade acknowledged replicating some of Horne's methods as he could not improve them.{{r|stokelwalker20150920}}
