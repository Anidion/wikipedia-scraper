'''''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''''' is a 1982 [[adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] for the [[Atari 2600]] and based on [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|the film of the same name.]] The game's objective is to guide the eponymous character through various screens to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone that will allow him to contact his home planet.

The game was designed by [[Howard Scott Warshaw]], who intended it to be an innovative [[Adaptation (arts)|adaptation]], but Atari held unrealistic expectations for sales based on the international box-office success of the film. Negotiations for the game rights ended in late July 1982, giving Warshaw just over five weeks to develop the game in time to meet the production schedule for the 1982 [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas season]].<ref name="hswinterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_howard_scott_warshaw.html |last=Scott |first=Stilphen |title=DP Interviews |publisher=Digitpress.com |access-date=March 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831054249/http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_howard_scott_warshaw.html |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The final release received negative reviews. The game is often cited as one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst of all time]] and one of the [[list of commercial failures in video games|biggest commercial failures in video game history]]. It is cited as a major contributing factor to the [[video game crash of 1983]], and has been frequently referenced and mocked in [[popular culture]] as a [[cautionary tale]] about the dangers of rushed game development and studio interference.

In what was once deemed only an [[urban legend]], reports from 1983 stated that as a result of overproduction and returns, unsold [[Atari video game burial|cartridges were secretly buried]] in a landfill in [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]], and covered with a layer of concrete. In April 2014, diggers hired to investigate the claim confirmed that the landfill contained several ''E.T.'' cartridges, among other games.<ref name="Fuel Industries access">{{cite web|last=Goldsmith |first=Alex |title=Alamogordo approves Atari excavation |url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/southeast/alamogordo-approves-atari-excavation |access-date=May 31, 2013 |publisher=[[KRQE]] |location=ALAMOGORDO, N.M. |date=May 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719024233/http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/southeast/alamogordo-approves-atari-excavation |archive-date=July 19, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/e-t-found-in-new-mexico-landfill-1568100161|title=E.T.

== Gameplay ==

Two characters stand in the middle of the field.|E.T. meets Elliott in a field of wells. [[Reese's Pieces]] are scattered throughout the world and are represented by black dots.]]

''E.T.'' is an [[adventure game]] in which players control the alien [[E.T. (character)|E.T.]] from a [[top-down perspective]]. The objective is to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). There is no overall time limit.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harris |first1=John |title=Review Roundup: Was E.T.

To prevent this, E.T. can collect [[Reese's Pieces]], which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call [[Elliott Taylor|Elliott]] to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. Once the call is made, a clock appears at the top right of the screen; E.T. has to arrive at the landing zone before it reaches zero.<ref name="manual">{{cite web |title=E.T.* THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL manual |url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=157 |website=atariage.com |publisher=Atari |access-date=16 July 2020 |archive-date=March 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210313171423/https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=157 |url-status=live }}</ref> Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on-screen and take him back to his home planet.

E.T. can get a fourth life if the player finds a geranium in one of the wells.

The game is divided into six environments, each representing a different setting from the film. To accomplish the objective, the player must guide E.T. into the wells. Once all items found in a well are collected, the player must levitate E.T. out of them.<ref name="abctv-rev">{{cite episode|series=Good Game|series-link=Good Game (TV program)|number=25|series-no=4|title=Good Game Shocks the 80s|time=3:58|url=https://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/video/default.htm?year=2008|transcript=Good Game Stories - Game Review: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|transcript-url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2380512.htm|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=6 October 2008|access-date = September 21, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008041052/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2380512.htm|archive-date = October 8, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> An icon at the top of each screen represents the current area, each area enabling the player to perform different actions.

== Development ==
Following the commercial success of ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' in June 1982, [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]], CEO of Atari's parent company [[Warner Communications]], began negotiations with the film's director [[Steven Spielberg]] and its distributor [[Universal Pictures]] to acquire a license to produce a video game based on the film. Later that month, Warner announced its exclusive worldwide rights to market coin-operated and console games based on ''E.T.''<ref name="announce">{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/19/business/atari-gets-et-rights.html|title=Atari Gets 'E.T.'

Warshaw used those days to design the structure and segmented the concept into four ideas: world, objective, the path to achieve the objective, and obstacles. He envisioned a six-sided world that players could "float" around as the setting, and adapted part of the film's plot, E.T. phoning home, as the goal.<ref name="DP" /> The player would need to gather parts for a phone to call his ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal.<ref name="NPR">{{cite web |last1=Brumfiel |first1=Geoff |title=Total Failure: The World's Worst Video Game |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/05/31/530235165/total-failure-the-worlds-worst-video-game |publisher=NPR |access-date=9 May 2020 |date=31 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200514194329/https://www.npr.org/2017/05/31/530235165/total-failure-the-worlds-worst-video-game |archive-date=May 14, 2020}}</ref> Warshaw considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game, and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console. Inspired by the film, adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien. Pits were devised as an element to hide the pieces of the phone as well as expand the game world.<ref name="DP" />

Warshaw and other Atari executives presented this design to Spielberg, who was not enthusiastic.<ref name="GS-2600Keynote"/> According to Warshaw, Spielberg asked him: "Couldn't you do something more like ''[[Pac-Man]]''?"<ref name="BBC">{{cite news |last1=Hooper |first1=Richard |title=The man who made 'the worst video game in history' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35560458 |access-date=17 July 2020 |work=BBC |date=22 February 2016 |archive-date=August 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804083251/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35560458 |url-status=live }}</ref> Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design, Warshaw proceeded with his concept, which he believed would capture the sentimentality he saw in the original film.<ref name="AVinterview"/><ref name="GS-2600Keynote"/> (Warshaw later stated that, in retrospect, Spielberg's idea might have had merit.)<ref name="GS-2600Keynote"/> He spent the remaining time programming.

=== Critical response ===
While reviews of the [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|film]] were acclaimed, the game was largely received negatively  by critics, with common complaints focused on the gameplay and visuals. In contemporary reviews, [[New York (magazine)|''New York'']]'s [[Nicholas Pileggi]] described it as a loser when compared to other games Atari could have released during the time period, such as ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and ''[[Frogger]]'', <ref name="NY-Pileggi"/> and ''Video Games'' called it "really for kids (the littler ones)".<ref name="wiswell198303">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_06_1983-03_Pumpkin_Press_US#page/n67/mode/2up | title=New Games From Well-Known Names | work=Video Games | date=March 1983 | access-date=May 26, 2014 | last=Wiswell | first=Phil | pages=69 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705010619/https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_06_1983-03_Pumpkin_Press_US#page/n67/mode/2up | archive-date=July 5, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> In 1984, ''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' readers named the game the second-worst Atari program of 1983, after ''[[Congo Bongo]]''.<ref name="stgame19840304">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&pub=6&id=16 | title=The Best and the Rest | magazine=St.Game ([[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]) | date=Mar–Apr 1984 | volume=3 | number=3 | issn=0745-4988 | access-date=July 28, 2014 | pages=49 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729222422/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&pub=6&id=16 | archive-date=July 29, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>
