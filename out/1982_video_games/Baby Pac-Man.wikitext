'''''Baby Pac-Man''''' is a hybrid [[List of maze video games|maze]] and [[pinball]] game released in arcades by [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]] on October 11, 1982, nine months after the release of ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''.<ref name="joystik">{{Cite magazine |date=April 1983 |title=Miss Conception Baby Pac-Man Bally/Midway |url=https://archive.org/details/joystik_magazine-1983-04/page/n11/mode/2up |magazine=Joystik Magazine |page=11 |access-date=December 18, 2022}}</ref> The cabinet consists of a 13-inch video screen seated above a shortened, horizontal pinball table. The combination fits into roughly the same size space as an upright arcade machine. 7,000 units were produced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baby Pac-Man|url=http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=125|work=The Internet Pinball Database Presents Baby Pac-Man|accessdate=July 2, 2010|archive-date=June 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617015005/http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=125|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
Play begins on the video screen, where the player controls Baby Pac-Man through a maze.<ref name="campbell">{{Cite magazine |last=Campbell |first=Stuart |date=May 2002 |title=Emulation Zone |url=https://archive.org/details/PC_Zone_115_May_2002/page/20/mode/2up |magazine=[[PC Zone]] |issue=115 |page=21 |access-date=December 18, 2022}}</ref> Play mechanics are similar to ''[[Pac-Man]]'' in that the object is to navigate the maze while gobbling dots and avoiding ghosts. In contrast to earlier games in the series, ''Baby Pac-Man'''s maze starts with no energizers, which allow Baby Pac-Man to eat the ghosts.<ref name="sharpe">{{Cite magazine |last=Sharpe |first=Rodger C. |date=May 1983 |title=Plain and Fancy Games Vie for Quarters |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_15_1983-05_Reese_Communications_US/page/n87/mode/2up |magazine=[[Electronic Games]] |pages=88–89 |access-date=December 18, 2022}}</ref> Instead, there are two vertical chutes at the bottom edge of the screen, which suspend video play and transfer the game to the pinball table located just below the monitor when the player travels down either of them.<ref name="vgm">{{Cite magazine |date=August 1983 |title=Bally's Baby Pac-Man |url=https://archive.org/details/video-games-volume-1-number-11-august-1983/page/34/mode/2up |magazine=[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment|Video Games]] |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=34–35 |access-date=December 18, 2022}}</ref><ref name="ward">{{Cite news |last=Ward |first=Ed |date=February 1, 1983 |title=Baby Pac may bring pinball back |pages=10 |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/114774564/baby-pac-man-1983/ |access-date=December 17, 2022 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |archive-date=December 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221217210409/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/114774564/baby-pac-man-1983/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Pinball mode ===
The mechanical pinball section operates as a traditional, though smaller, pinball table. The player hits targets with a metal ball using two button-operated flippers. The player may earn energizers, gain new fruit bonuses, and increase tunnel speed, all of which are used in the video mode.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=April 1983 |title=Pinball |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_0018/page/30/mode/2up |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |volume=2 |issue=5 |page=30 |access-date=December 18, 2022}}</ref> After losing a ball, the game resumes on the video screen, but with the chutes closed. The player must clear the maze or lose a life to reopen the chutes. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.
