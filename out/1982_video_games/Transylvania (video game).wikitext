'''''Transylvania''''' is an adventure video game published by [[Penguin Software]]. It was released for the [[Apple II]] in 1982 followed by ports to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and [[Commodore 64]]. A [[Mac (computer)|Mac]] conversion was published in 1984, then versions for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[MS-DOS]] in 1985.

==Plot==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2020}}

''Transylvania'' is a game on which the player takes on a quest involving rescuing Princess Sabrina and must travel the countryside where a [[werewolf]], a [[vampire]], a prankster [[goblin]], a [[witch]], and an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] [[starship|spaceship]] roam. The game gives the player a time limit (the player receives a note early in the game which reads, "Sabrina dies at dawn"), and the Princess is held in a [[coffin]] located in the castle tower.

==Reception==
Gregg Williams reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "I refer to the Atari 520 ST version of Polarware's Transylvania. The story line is fine, but the game makes almost no use of the ST's extra colors, resolution, or speed."<ref name="CGW28">{{cite magazine |last=Williams |first=Gregg |title=Atari Playfield |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=May 1986 |volume=1 |issue=28 |pages=28}}</ref>

The first game in the ''[[Transylvania (series)|Transylvania]]'' series was well received, appearing in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<ref>Billboard magazine, Oct. 13, 1984, p.27</ref> and ''[[Softalk]]'' best-sellers charts and in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''<ref>Wall Street Journal, July 18, 1984, p.23</ref> in a list of best-selling software. It received a Certificate of Merit in the category of "1984 Best Computer Game Audio-Visual Effects" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= February 1984 |title= Arcade Alley: The 1984 Arcade Awards, Part II |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 11|pages= 28–29|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref> It is considered one of the best examples of the adventure game genre.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' disliked the Atari ST versions of the first and second games, stating that "There just wasn't much of a story line" and that the ideal player age was a young teenager, not an adult. Despite this, however, because of their low price and "excellent" production values, graphics, and parser, the magazine recommended the games for those seeking graphic adventures for the ST.<ref name="panak198612">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/analog-computing-magazine-49/Analog_Computing_49_1986-12_8_Bit_Gift_Guide#page/n113/mode/2up | title=Panak Strikes | work=ANALOG Computing | date=December 1986 | accessdate=7 July 2014 | author=Panak, Steve | pages=97}}</ref>
