==Reception==
Chris Smith reviewed SSI's ''RapidFire Line'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 59, and commented that "My resulting disappointment lay in the fact that this game, unlike the others in the line, added nothing new to the computer game field. Combining strategic space games with arcade was a good idea, but there are still better arcade games of both kinds."<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last= Smith |first= Chris |date=January 1983 |title=SSI's RapidFire Line: Featured Review|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=59|pages=14–15}}</ref>

Dick Richards reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "I can think of only one real negative to the game. . .its name. Whether you call it SEUIS, or Shoot 'Em Up In Space, it sounds dim. But, if every game I buy plays as well and offers as much flexibility, then I really don't care what it's called."<ref name="CGW8">{{cite magazine |last=Richards |first=Dick |title=S.E.U.I.S.: Strategy and Arcade Combined |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jan–Feb 1983 |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=26–27}}</ref>
