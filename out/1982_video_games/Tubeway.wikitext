'''''Tubeway''''' (also known as '''''Tubeway ][''''') is game for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] programmed by David Arthur Van Brink and published by [[Datamost]] in 1983.<ref name="giantlist"/> It is similar to the 1981 Atari arcade game ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]''.

==Gameplay==

''Tubeway'' is a [[tube shooter]] in which the player uses [[paddle (game controller)|paddles]] to move a small white crosshair around the top of a "tube" or wall while firing down at the computer-controlled opponents attempting to scale their way up it.  The opponents, known as the [[Tubeway Army]] (one of several references to [[Gary Numan]] in the game),{{fact|date=October 2018}} consist of triangular green ''homers'' (100 points) and triangular blue ''seekers'' (200 points), both of which can return fire.  A special opponent called ''the germ'' occasionally emerges from a white box in the lower left corner of the screen.  The goal of the game is to clear as many levels as possible before running out of lives.  An extra life is granted every 20,000 points.

==Reception==
In an 8 out of 10 review, the January 1983 ''Arcade Express'' newsletter mentioned the similarity to ''Tempest'', but called it "just different enough to stand as an independent program within the same gaming genre."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/newsletters/arcadeexpress/arcade_express_v1n11.pdf#page=6 |title=The Hotseat |date=January 2, 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |journal=The Arcade Express}}</ref>

In 1984, ''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' readers named ''Tubeway'' the sixth-worst Apple program of 1983.<ref name="stgame19840304">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&pub=6&id=16 | title=The Best and the Rest | work=St.Game | date=Marâ€“Apr 1984 | accessdate=28 July 2014 | pages=49}}</ref>
