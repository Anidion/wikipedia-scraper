{{nihongo foot|'''''Donkey Kong Jr.'''''|ドンキーコングJR.|'''''Donkī Kongu Junia'''''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1982 [[arcade game|arcade]] [[platform game]] that was released by [[Nintendo]]. It is the [[sequel]] to ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', but with the roles reversed compared to its predecessor: [[Mario]] is now the villain and [[Donkey Kong Junior (Nintendo character)|Donkey Kong Jr.]] is trying to save his kidnapped father. It first released in [[Arcade game|arcades]] and, over the course of the decade, was released for a variety of home platforms. The game's title is written out as '''''Donkey Kong Junior''''' in the North American arcade version and various conversions to non-Nintendo systems.

The game was principally designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and his coworker and the company's chief engineer [[Gunpei Yokoi]].<ref>{{Cite journal |date=September 2003 |title=Miyamoto Interview |url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/081403.shtml |url-status=dead |journal=[[Nintendo Official Magazine UK]] |publisher=[[EMAP]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210073052/http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/081403.shtml |archive-date=December 10, 2006}}</ref> Miyamoto also created the graphics for the title along with [[Yoshio Sakamoto]].<ref name="artist">{{Cite magazine |last=Kohler |first=Chris |date=April 7, 2010 |title=Q&A: Metroid Creator's Early 8-Bit Days at Nintendo |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/04/sakamoto/ |access-date=August 26, 2010 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired: GameLife]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Digital]]}}</ref> As with its predecessor, the music for the game was composed by Yukio Kaneoka.<ref name="composer">{{Cite AV media notes |url=http://vgmdb.net/album/404 |title=Famicom 20th Anniversary Original Sound Tracks Vol. 1 |year=2004 |publisher=Scitron Digital Contents}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Donkey Kong Jr. (arcade game).png|thumb|left|Donkey Kong Jr. trying to rescue [[Donkey Kong (character)|his father]] from the cage next to [[Mario]]]]
Like its predecessor, ''Donkey Kong Jr.'' is a platform game. There are a total of four stages, each with a unique theme. DK Jr. can run left and right, jump, and grab vines/chains/ropes to climb higher on the screen. He can slide down faster by holding only one vine, or climb faster by holding two. Enemies include "Snapjaws", which resemble bear traps with eyes; bird-like creatures called "Nitpickers", some of which can attack by dropping eggs; and "Sparks" which roam across the wiring in one of Mario's hideouts. DK Jr. can jump over these enemies while on platforms, switch from one vine/chain/rope to another to dodge them, or knock down pieces of fruit that will destroy every enemy they touch before falling off the bottom of the screen.

To pass the first three stages, DK Jr. must reach the key hanging next to his father's cage, whereupon Mario flees while pushing the cage off the screen. In the fourth stage, DK Jr. must push six keys into locks on the topmost platform to free Donkey Kong. After a brief cutscene, the player is taken back to the first stage at an increased difficulty. A bonus timer runs throughout each stage, and any points remaining on it are added to the player's score upon completion.

DK Jr. loses a life when he touches any enemy or projectile, falls too great a distance, touches the water and falls off the bottom of the screen or if the bonus timer counts down to zero. The game ends when the player loses all of their lives.

==Plot==
[[Cranky Kong|Donkey Kong]] has been defeated by Mario, who has put him in a cage in a forest. Donkey Kong's son, Donkey Kong Jr., follows Mario in an attempt to free his father. Mario transports Donkey Kong to his Hideout via helicopter, before Mario takes the keys to Donkey Kong's chains and places them around the building. Several enemies attack Donkey Kong Jr., but he escapes them and makes it to his father, releasing him from the chains as Mario falls to the ground. Donkey Kong Jr. saves Donkey Kong and the two set off together. Mario pursues the kongs, but flees after Donkey Kong knocks him back.

==Development==
During ''Donkey Kong''’s development in 1981, Shigeru Miyamoto's team had come up with several ideas and full complete levels that wouldn't really fit into the game due to the various constraints. His team eventually began fleshing out these concepts, and these designs evolved into something all their own. The process was so far along, with even entire stages conceived, that one of the team members suggested they start working on another video game. The conversation happened around the same time that Nintendo wanted another Donkey Kong coin-op to capitalize on the original's fame, giving Miyamoto the perfect opportunity to further explore his newly established franchise. Originally, Miyamoto wanted the new game to star Donkey Kong himself, but there were problems with the character's massive size. He wouldn't be maneuverable on the screen, so a new star was needed. The change brought about a new hero and drove the narrative in an entirely new direction. They ultimately came up with the idea to make a smaller Donkey Kong in place of Mario who would be the son of Donkey Kong. Since they still wanted a big Donkey Kong on top of the screen, they came up with the plot of Mario capturing him after the events of the first game.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Ken |title=Beyond Donkey Kong |date=2020 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers]] |pages=90–91}}</ref>

===Versions===
The order of the levels is different in different territories. In the Japanese version, the four levels appear in 1-2-3-4 sequence and then repeat, just as with the Japanese release of ''Donkey Kong''. In the US version, the order is 1–4. 1–2–4, 1–3–4, 1-2-3-4 and then 1-2-3-4 from then on.

===Kill screen===
''Donkey Kong Jr.'' has a kill screen at level 22. Due to the level counter only having one digit, the counter shows numbers 1 to 9 in levels 1 to 9, seven blanks in levels 10 to 16, and the letters A to F in the levels 17–22. The kill screen occurs the same way as in ''Donkey Kong'', where an integer overflow occurs after too big a result is given after a multiplication problem in the computing. The timer counts as if there are 700 points, then kills Donkey Kong Jr. until all lives are gone.

==Ports==
[[File:Donkey Kong Jr. Game&watch.jpg|thumb|New Wide Screen Game & Watch ''Donkey Kong Jr.'']]

''Donkey Kong Jr.'' was made on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] (for which it was one of three Japanese [[launch game]]s<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Marley |first=Scott |date=December 2016 |title=SG-1000 |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |issue=163 |pages=56–61}}</ref>), [[Famicom Disk System|Family Computer Disk System]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Coleco Adam]], and [[Intellivision]]. A [[BBC Micro]] conversion was made but unreleased. Three [[Game & Watch]] versions of the game were also made. Two black-and-white versions for the New Wide Screen and Multi Screen handheld series (later under the model name ''[[Donkey Kong II]]''), and a color version for the Tabletop and Panorama series. In 2002 the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version was rereleased on the [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] add-on, the [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]].

==Reception==
In Japan, the original arcade version was the eighth-highest-grossing [[1982 in video games|arcade game of 1982]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=1 March 1983 |title="Pole Position" No. 1 Video Game: ''Game Machine''{{'}}s "The Year's Best Three AM Machines" Survey Results |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830301p.pdf#page=16 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |issue=207 |page=30}}</ref>

Raymond Dimetrosky of ''Video Games Player'' gave the ColecoVision version a positive review. He compared it favorably with another ColecoVision arcade conversion released at the same time, [[Sega]]'s ''[[Space Fury]]'', writing that ''Donkey Kong Jr.'' has better graphics and gameplay.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Dimetrosky |first=Raymond |date=September 1983 |title=Video Game Buyer's Guide: Donkey Kong Jr. (Coleco) vs. Space Fury (Coleco) |url=https://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Player_Vol_2_No_1_1983-09_Carnegie_Publications_US/page/n54 |magazine=Video Games Player |location=United States |publisher=Carnegie Publications |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=56}}</ref> ''Computer Games'' magazine in 1984 reviewed the Coleco Adam version, calling it a "supergame adaptation" and the best conversion of the game.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=December 1984 |title=Conversion Capsules: Hit Games in New Formats |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Games_Vol_3_No_4_1984-12_Carnegie_Publications_US/page/n61/mode/2up |magazine=Computer Games |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=62–3}}</ref>

''Donkey Kong Jr.'' received an award in the category of "1984 Best Videogame Audio-Visual Effects (16K or more ROM)" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]], where the judges described it as "great fun", and noted that the game was successful as a sequel–"extend[ing] the theme and present[ing] a radically different play-action" than its predecessor, ''Donkey Kong''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kunkel |first1=Bill |author-link=Bill Kunkel (journalist) |last2=Katz |first2=Arnie |date=January 1984 |title=Arcade Alley: The Arcade Awards, Part 1 |journal=[[Video (magazine)|Video]] |publisher=Reese Communications |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=40–42 |issn=0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|42}}

''Donkey Kong Jr.'' is regarded as one of the ''Top 100 Video Games'' by the [[Killer List of Videogames]]. It was selected to be among five arcade games chosen for history's first official video game world championship, which was filmed at [[Twin Galaxies]] in [[Ottumwa, Iowa]] by ABC-TV's ''[[That's Incredible!]]'' over the weekend of January 8–9, 1983.

[[AllGame|Allgame]] gave a review score of 4 out of 5 stars praising the graphics and sound being "exceptionally arcade-like" and the controls and play mechanics being faithful to the arcade version.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brett Alan Weiss |title=Donkey Kong Jr. Review |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9425&tab=review |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114210917/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9425&tab=review |archive-date=November 14, 2014 |access-date=December 24, 2020 |website=allgame}}</ref>

===In popular culture===
The game spawned a cereal with fruit-flavored cereal pieces shaped like bananas and cherries.

The game was featured on numerous episodes of ''[[Starcade]]''. Host [[Geoff Edwards]] noted that he had the arcade machine in his dressing room and found the game to be highly difficult.

Donkey Kong Jr. was a cartoon on ''[[Saturday Supercade]]'' (a series that aired on Saturday mornings from 1983 to 1985) with the title character voiced by [[Frank Welker]].

Donkey Kong Jr. is one of the 8 playable characters in ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' for the SNES. He is also a playable character in ''[[Mario's Tennis]]'' on [[Virtual Boy]] and ''[[Mario Tennis]]'' on the [[Nintendo 64]].

In the version of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' seen in ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'', as well as the Game Boy Advance version, the king of World 4 was transformed into a young gorilla identical to Donkey Kong Jr.

Donkey Kong Jr. is among the characters in ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' that players can transform into by use of Mystery Mushrooms.
