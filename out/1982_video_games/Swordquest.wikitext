'''''Swordquest''''' is a series of video games originally produced by [[Atari, Inc.]] in the 1980s as part of a [[competition|contest]], consisting of three finished games, '''''Earthworld''''', '''''Fireworld''''' and '''''Waterworld''''' (with these titles occasionally appearing on cartridge labels and boxes with capitalized central Ws, e.g. '''''EarthWorld'''''), and a planned fourth game, '''''Airworld'''''.

== About ==
Each of the games came with a [[comic book]] that explained the plot, as well as containing part of the solution to a major [[puzzle]] that had to be solved to win the contest, with a series of prizes whose total value was $150,000. The series had its genesis as a possible [[sequel]] to Atari's groundbreaking 1979 title ''[[Adventure (1980 video game)|Adventure]]'', but it developed mythology and a system of play that was unique.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=GRUNDHAUSER |first=Eric |date=8 March 2016 |title=The Quest for the Real-Life Treasures of Atari's Swordquest |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-quest-for-the-reallife-treasures-of-ataris-swordquest |access-date=10 July 2023 |website=Atlas Obscura}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Grundhauser |first=Eric |date=2016-03-08 |title=The Quest for the Real-Life Treasures of Atari's Swordquest |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-quest-for-the-reallife-treasures-of-ataris-swordquest |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=Atlas Obscura |language=en}}</ref>

The comic books were produced by [[DC Comics]], written by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gerry Conway]], and drawn and inked by [[George Pérez]] and [[Dick Giordano]].  All three game box covers were illustrated by an Atari in-house illustrator, Warren Chang. A special fan club offer was provided, allowing those who wanted the game to also get a T-shirt and poster for each game.<ref name=":0" />

The games of the Swordquest series (along with Atari 2600 ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (video game)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'') were some of the earliest attempts to combine the narrative and logic elements of the adventure game genre with the [[twitch gameplay]] of the action genre, making them some of the first [[action-adventure game]]s. However, due to Atari's financial problems related to the [[video game crash of 1983]], the last contest along with the grand finale contest were never held and the final game in the series, ''Airworld'' was not released. As such the contest was never completed and the current unknown fate of some of the prizes has become an [[urban legend]] in the gaming community.

As part of ''[[Atari 50]]: The Anniversary Celebration'', a collection of Atari games for its 50th anniversary in 2022, [[Digital Eclipse]] created a version of ''Airworld'' that completes the ''Swordquest'' series.

== Gameplay ==
Each game of the ''Swordquest'' series was themed after the [[classical elements]]: earth, fire, water, and air. Each game required the player to move through a maze of rooms, collecting objects from one and placing them in other rooms. The arrangement or theme of the rooms varied with each game: ''Earthworld'' was themed after the [[Zodiac|Western zodiac]], ''Fireworld'' after the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Kabbalah tree of life]], ''Waterworld'' after the [[chakras]], and with ''Airworld'' to have been modeled after the ''[[I Ching]]''.<ref name="atlat obs"/> Traversing between rooms sometimes required the player to complete a "twitch"-style minigame to progress. When the player placed an item in its correct room, they would be presented with numerical clues that referred to a page and panel within the comic that was packaged with the game. There, the player would find a hidden word that was part of the larger ''Swordquest'' contest, as by submitting all the correct words in the correct order to Atari, they would be entered into the next phase of the project.<ref name="eg198306">{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n45/mode/2up|title=The Players Guide to Fantasy Games|date=June 1983|work=[[Electronic Games]]|access-date=6 January 2015|pages=47}}</ref> The discovered words would form a relevant phrase towards the larger contest. In at least two cases, for ''Earthworld'' and ''Fireworld'', there were more clues indicated by the game than required to be submitted. Players also had to identify a second clue in the game's instruction manual (for ''Earthworld'', indicating [[prime number]]s to use only clues on prime numbered pages) to know which clues to send in.<ref name="eg"/><ref name="atlat obs"/><ref name=":0" />

==Plot==
The games follow twins named Tarra and Torr. Their parents were slain by King Tyrannus's guards, prompted by a prophecy by the king's [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] Konjuro that the twins would slay Tyrannus. The twins were then raised as commoners by thieves to avoid being slain by the king. When they go to plunder Konjuro's sea keep, they accidentally reveal their identities to him. The twins then start running from a [[demon]] summoned to kill them, but it appears that a jewel they stole attracts it. After smashing the stone to avoid the demon, two of Tyrannus's old advisers appear and tell the two about the "Sword of Ultimate Sorcery" and the "Talisman of Penultimate Truth." They are then transported to Earthworld.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Swordquest |url=https://gamebooks.org/swdquest.htm |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=gamebooks.org}}</ref>

After defeating many beasts of the Zodiac and another thief (Herminus) in Earthworld, the twins are transported to the "central chamber" where the "Sword of Ultimate Sorcery" and the "Talisman of Penultimate Truth" are kept. Upon reaching them, the sword burns a hole through its altar all the way to Fireworld. In Fireworld, the twins split up to look for water, and Torr, with the aid of the talisman, summons Mentorr who shows Torr the "Chalice of Light," which will quench his thirst. The twins reunite eventually and find the chalice. However, Torr drops it after he is startled, and it is revealed that the one they found was not the ''true'' chalice. Herminus then gives them the chalice, and it grows until it becomes large enough to swallow the twins and transports them to Waterworld.

Upon reaching Waterworld, the twins become separated. Konjuro casts a spell that causes the twins to lose their memories. Tarra travels to a ship made of ice and meets Cap'n Frost, who desires to find the "Crown of Life" and rule Waterworld. Meanwhile, Torr travels to an undersea kingdom and meets the city's ex-queen Aquana, who desires to find the "Crown of Life" in order to regain her throne. After a brief war between the ex-queen and captain, Herminus sets the twins to duel each other. They then pray to their deities for guidance, which summons Mentorr who allows them to regain their memories. The twins throw down their swords, causing the crown to be revealed and split in half. The halves are given to the ex-queen and the captain, who then rule as equals. The "Sword of Ultimate Sorcery" then transports the twins to Airworld where they would have to do battle with King Tyrannus and Konjuro.

While the comic for ''Airworld'' was started, the cancellation of the series left the comic unfinished.<ref name="atlat obs"/>

== Development ==
The concept of ''Swordquest'' originated from Atari's previous ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' video game, which is notable for one of the first documented [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]]s. ''Adventure'' drew more interest once the Easter egg was found and documented, leading Atari to come up with a type of sequel where "marketing thought it would be a great idea to create a series of games where players would have to find clues both in the game [and in its physical materials]", as described by Atari historian Curt Vendel.<ref name="atlat obs">{{cite web | url = https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-quest-for-the-reallife-treasures-of-ataris-swordquest | title = The Quest for the Real-Life Treasures of Atari's Swordquest | first = Eric | last = Grundhauser | date = March 8, 2016 | access-date = September 28, 2018 | work = [[Atlas Obscura]] }}</ref> As Atari was owned by [[Warner Communications]] at this point, they were able to use two of Warner's subsidiaries to help with this contest.<ref name="eg"/> [[DC Comics]] was used to create the comic book that would help creating the setting where the word clues would be hidden, written by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Roy Thomas]] and illustrated by [[George Pérez]].<ref name="atlat obs"/> The [[Franklin Mint]] crafted the game's prizes.<ref name="eg">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-06-the-35-year-hunt-for-swordquests-lost-treasures | title = The 35-year hunt for Swordquest's lost treasures | first = Phil | last = Iwaniuk | date = August 6, 2017 | access-date = September 28, 2018 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The games themselves were programmed by [[Tod Frye]].<ref name="atlat obs"/>

=== Contest ===
Atari had designed the ''Swordquest'' contest to award a winner for each of the four games. For each game, they had planned to bring all winners to the Atari headquarters in [[Sunnyvale, California]], to race to complete a specially-programmed version of that game to be the first to finish it. The person with the fastest completion would be named the winner and be awarded a "treasure", produced by Franklin Mint, each valued at around {{USD|25,000}} at the time of ''Swordquest''{{'}}s release. The prizes were:<ref name="eg"/>
* ''Earthworld'': The "Talisman of Penultimate Truth", an 18-karat solid gold disc studded with 12 diamonds, the birthstones of the 12 Zodiac signs and a miniature white gold sword set atop it.
* ''Fireworld'': The "Chalice of Light", a goblet made of platinum and gold studded with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls, and green jade.
* ''Waterworld'': The "Crown of Life", a solid gold crown decorated with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and aquamarines.
* ''Airworld'': The "Philosopher's Stone", a large piece of white jade encased in an 18-karat gold box encrusted with emeralds, rubies, and diamonds.
The four winners would then have competed in a final contest to win the ultimate prize, "The Sword of Ultimate Sorcery" with a silver blade and an 18-carat gold handle covered with diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, and rubies, that was valued at {{USD|50,000}}<ref name="eg"/>

For ''Earthworld'', about 5000 entries were received, but only eight answered correctly. The contest was held in May 1983, with Stephen Bell winning the Talisman. For ''Fireworld'', Atari received several more entries, with 73 of these being correct. For practicality, Atari required the 73 finalists to write a brief essay of what they liked about the game, selecting the top 50 replies to continue to the final competition, held in January 1984. This was won by Michael Rideout, who was awarded the Chalice.<ref name="eg"/><ref name="atlat obs"/>

At this point in time, Atari had suffered major financial setbacks due to the [[1983 video game crash]]. Atari was further in the midst of dealing with fallout from an insider trading scandal by former CEO [[Ray Kassar]]; Kassar was replaced by [[James J. Morgan]] in mid-1983, and looking to cut financial losses, eventually cancelled the ''Swordquest'' project, despite work having already started on ''Airworld''.<ref name="games"/><ref name="atlat obs"/> However, because the company had already advertised the availability of the ''Waterworld'' contest, Atari's lawyers required the company to continue the contest.<ref name="games">{{cite magazine | title = The $378,870.10 Contest That Wasn't | first = Andrew | last = Parr | date = October 2018 | magazine = [[Games World of Puzzles]] | pages = 38–39 }}</ref>  To limit the number of entries, ''Waterworld'' was only made available to members of the Atari Club. During the contest period, in mid-1984, Atari was sold to [[Jack Tramiel]], the owner of [[Commodore International]]. Tramiel, who had been more focused on the success of home computers than gaming consoles, placed the Atari divisions in a new company, Tramel Technology, and reviewed the state of all divisions, furthering the troubles in completing the ''Waterworld'' contest. Most who did enter the ''Waterworld'' contest were told they did not qualify for the final, but according to Vendel, Atari was legally required to follow through as advertised on the ''Waterworld'' contest. Vendel stated that Atari did secretly invite those with correct entries to hold the final round, and the Crown was awarded to a person, their name remaining anonymous due to legal requirements.<ref name="atlat obs"/> Because they could not hold the ultimate final round, Bell and Rideout were both awarded an additional {{USD|15,000}} as well as an [[Atari 7800]] as a compensation prize, and granting the ten finalists of ''Waterworld'' {{USD|2,000}} each.<ref name="atlat obs"/><ref name="eg"/>

The fate of the prizes has become an [[urban legend]] in the gaming community since the cancellation of the project. Of the five treasures, Rideout has claimed, as recently as 2017, that he still has the Chalice in his possession, stored in a safe deposit box.<ref name="eg"/> Bell fell out of contact following the ''Swordquest'' event, but according to Vendel and Rideout, Bell appeared to have had the disc part of the Talisman melted down for its value (about {{USD|15,000}} at the time), keeping the small sword, diamonds, and birthstones; the current fate of these is unknown.<ref name="eg"/> The fate of the Crown is unknown; Vendel stated that while Atari was required to hold the contest, they could have simply awarded the winner with a cash prize equivalent as opposed to the Crown.<ref name="eg"/>

Since they were never part of any contest, the Philosopher's Stone and the Sword have seemingly disappeared. Some sources have claimed that Tramiel took possession of the prizes himself, based on rumoured observations that Atari staff or associates of Tramiel had made of seeing a similar looking sword mounted in Tramiel's office or on his home mantel. However, Vendel believes that the persons who started this rumor may have mistaken a Tramiel family heirloom for the ''Swordquest'' sword. Vendel believes that it is unlikely that Tramiel would have been able to keep the Stone, Sword, and (if not given away) Crown, as when Atari, Inc was sold, these items were still the property of Warner Communications, and would have been returned to the Franklin Mint. With the Franklin Mint later being sold in 1985 to American Protective Services, and the original Atari business no longer existing, the prizes were most likely melted back down to their base components for reuse elsewhere, according to Vendel.<ref name="eg"/>

On June 29, 2022, Atari announced that as part of the ''Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration'' collection, that the Digital Eclipse team had created the fourth and final entry in the Swordquest series, Airworld. ''[[Atari 50]]'' was released on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows in November 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Real Otaku Gamer Providing You With The Best Otaku News, Reviews and Entertainment |date=29 June 2022 |url=https://realotakugamer.com/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration-announced-includes-over-90-titles-all-atari-platforms-reimagined-games/83071/ |access-date=2022-06-29 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/23451349/atari-50-review-xbox-playstation-switch-steam  | title = Atari 50 is an incredible playable tour through video game history | first=  Andrew | last=  Webster | date = November 11, 2022 | accessdate = November 11, 2022 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref>

==Comic books==
===Original mini-comics===
Each of the three released games shipped with a comic book, published jointly by Atari and [[DC Comics]]. The books included clues to solve the puzzles within each of the games.

===[[Dynamite Entertainment]] mini-series===
In February 2017, [[Dynamite Entertainment]] announced a new comic book series, called ''Swordquest'', but based on the actual contest around the three games, rather than the story within the games. It was a six-issue series, starting with a special #0 "Preview" book that sold with a cover price of 25¢ and was published in May 2017. The remaining 5 issues, published monthly after the preview, sold at $3.99 each. In addition, Dynamite released a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] that reprinted the three mini-comics along with the mini-comic for the game ''[[Yars' Revenge]]''. As with the originals, the TPB is sized as a mini-comic.

The series featured the story of a person who had played the three ''Swordquest'' games (with help from two friends who were brother and sister) when he was younger and was anticipating ''Airworld''. Now as an adult, he continues his efforts to play ''Airworld'' using his old Atari hardware, but is caught up with a mysterious figure who offers to help him obtain the real "Sword of Ultimate Sorcery" from its resting place in the World Arcade Museum. As well as being valuable, it may have its own mysterious powers. The man contacts his two childhood friends to accompany him on his new "Swordquest".

The comic was written by [[Chad Bowers]] and [[Chris Sims (writer)|Chris Sims]] and had art by [[Scott Kowalchuk]] under the pseudonym "Ghostwriter X". A trade paperback reprint of all six issues, titled ''Swordquest: Realworld'' was released in February 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/20/14678122/atari-swordquest-comics-return-dynamite-entertainment | title = Atari's bringing back its Swordquest comics | first=  Michael | last = McWhertor | date = February 20, 2017 | access-date = February 20, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>
