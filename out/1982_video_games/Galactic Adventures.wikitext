==Reception==
David Long reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "SSI has done a superb job on this sequel to GG. Most role playing games have a rather abstract combat resolution sequence. GA has a complete game within a game for combat resolution, along with as complicated a series of adventures as you could want."<ref name="CGW11">{{cite magazine |last=Long |first=David |title=Galactic Adventures: Review & Hints |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jul–Aug 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=20–21, 48}}</ref>

Norman J. Banduch reviewed ''Galactic Adventures'' in ''[[Space Gamer]]'' No. 66.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Banduch |first=Norman J. |date=Nov–Dec 1983 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=66|pages=37–38}}</ref> Banduch commented that "''Galactic Adventures'' is a very fine game. It has excellent graphics, a wealth of options, and the game works. The price is high, but the cost per hour becomes very low. I found that ''Galactic Adventures'' is not a game that gets old fast. It is an excellent addition to almost any adventure gamer's computer library."<ref name="SG"/>
