'''''Sky Jinks''''' is a vertically-scrolling, [[air racing]]-themed [[video game]] developed by [[Bob Whitehead]] for the [[Atari 2600]] [[video game console]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=437 |title=''Sky Jinks'' |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Atari Age |access-date=24 May 2013}}</ref> and published by [[Activision]] in 1982.

==Gameplay==
In ''Sky Jinks'', the player pilots a low-flying [[Seversky XP-41]]<ref name="Weiss">{{cite book |last=Weiss |first=Brett |title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&pg=PA303 |access-date=25 May 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina|Jefferson]] |isbn=9780786432264 |oclc=124036221 |page=105}}</ref> airplane through a [[time trial]]. To complete a [[game level]], the player must [[Banked turn|bank]] around a prescribed number of [[Traffic pylon|pylon]]s (left for blue and right for red). The XP-41 can bank left and right, as well as accelerate and decelerate. Flying into a pylon (which counts), tree, or [[hot air balloon]] slows down the plane.

The game has four courses: Polo Grounds, Aero Race, Love Field, and Speedy Meadows. There is also a [[pseudo-random]]ly-generated course called Thompson Tourney.<ref name="Weiss" />

==Legacy==
In the mid-1980s, [[social psychologist]] [[Roy Baumeister]] used the game in his [[psychological research]] into [[performance anxiety]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Beilock |first=Sian |title=Choke: Use the Secrets of Your Brain to Succeed When It Matters Most |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3AtuWM6ZPUC&pg=PA244 |access-date=25 May 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=New York |isbn=9781416596172 |oclc=464593186 |pages=244–45}}</ref>
