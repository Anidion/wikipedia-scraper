'''''Tunnels of Doom''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] programmed by Kevin Kenney for the [[TI-99/4A]] home computer and published by Texas Instruments on December 31, 1982.{{sfn|Tresca|2011|p=138}} It was available in two formats: cartridge with accompanying disk and cartridge with cassette.{{sfn|1984 complete sourcebook of personal computing|p=272}}

Based loosely on the [[tabletop role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', it is a [[dungeon crawl]] in which players control the fates of 1â€“4 characters as they navigate a maze of tunnels.{{sfn|Tresca|2011|p=138}}{{sfn|Wolf|2001}} [[Texas Instruments]] used the game in its marketing, citing it as entertainment software involving "strategy and logic".{{sfn|National Geographic|1983|p=288}}<!-- many other magazines in which the ad was featured, such as Newsweek -->

==Gameplay==
The game has four character classes: hero, fighter, rogue, and wizard. The "hero" class is only available in a single character game.{{sfn|Tresca|2011|p=138}}

Upon encountering an enemy, the game transitions to a separate, graphical, overhead battle screen, where a [[Turn-based tactics|tactical turn-based]] combat system is used that allows for movement and positioning. It's possible to listen at doors for sounds of monsters, which can be negotiated with in combat as well.<ref>[http://www.armchairarcade.com/neo/node/1024 "Review: Texas Instruments' "Tunnels of Doom"(1982)"]</ref>
