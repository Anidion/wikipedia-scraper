The '''''Prisoner 2''''' is a video game published in 1982 by [[Edu-Ware]]. It is a remake of the 1980 game ''[[The Prisoner (video game)|The Prisoner]]''. 

==Gameplay==
In 1982, Edu-Ware released a second version of the game entitled ''Prisoner 2'', with color and improved high-resolution graphics replacing the original's [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]] with a [[Video game graphics#First-person perspective|first-person]] view. In addition to the Apple II, this version was also available for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and [[MS-DOS]]. ''Prisoner 2'' was essentially the same as the first ''Prisoner'' game, only with updated graphics and a limited number of design changes, several of which referenced other games:

* A fence (which the player may attempt to jump over) now surrounds the Island.
* Rover's appearance was changed from a white ball to that of an entity resembling [[Pac-Man]].
* The ''Hospital'' is now home to the Milgram Experiment, which is now a special event that occurs periodically.
* The Free Information display was moved to the ''Town Hall''; the Hall still houses the ''Run the Island'' task but only as a special event occurring periodically.
* The ''Recreation Hall'' has expanded obstacle courses.
* The ''Great Chair'' has been moved into a multi-roomed building called the ''Switchyard.''  Most rooms are identical to each other except for a single letter on the wall, which together spell out "[[Rubik's Cube]]".  Three rooms are special: the Great Chair room itself, the switch room (with a switch to disable the music that accompanies the scrolling game text), and the exit.
* The ''Library'' sends the player on literary-themed quests for the ''[[Wicked Witch of the West|Wicked Witch of the West's]]'' broomstick or Injun Joe's treasure (from ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''), if he chooses not to burn books.
* The building that formerly housed the Milgram Experiment is renamed ''Grail Hall'' and contains items for the ''Library'' quests.  It is a maze of rooms, including some that mimick the look of [[Scott Adams (game designer)|Scott Adams' adventure games]], or that reference adventure games such as ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' (a cave with the word "PLUGH" written on the wall), ''[[Wizard and the Princess]]'' (a castle, whereupon arrival, the player is sent back to the ''Castle''), and ''[[Mystery House]]'' (whereupon arrival, the player is told "He's killed Ken!" (a reference to [[Ken Williams (game developer)|Ken Williams]] of [[Sierra On-Line]]) and is accused of murder until granted absolution in the ''Church'').

==Reception==
[[Jeff Rovin]] for ''[[Videogaming Illustrated]]'' said that "A great piece of computergaming from both a design point of view and as a challenge, though the lack of originality is disappointing."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_and_Computer_Gaming_Illustrated_1983-06_Ion_International_US|title=Videogaming and Computer Gaming Illustrated (1983-06)(Ion International)(US)|date=June 17, 1983|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

C.J. Thorns for ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' said that "''Prisoner II'' is a superb package (I dare not call it a "game") that should provide weeks of entertainment. It goes far beyond the traditional "collect the right combination of treasures" adventure, and includes some diabolical arcade-like sequences to frustrate you even more."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/analog-computing-magazine-16|title=Analog Computing Magazine Issue 16 (Graphics)|date=February 17, 1984|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Jeff Hurlburt for ''[[SoftSide]]'' said that "''Prisoner 2'' is a superbly crafted adventuring experience. Surely among the more complex computer games, it will repay the involved player with hours of enjoyment in a variety of imaginative, challenging, often humorous scenarios."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/softside-magazine-59|title=SoftSide Magazine Issue 59 (Broadway Adventure)|date=September 17, 1983|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Softalk]]'' said that "You have been forewarned. The time and patient you devote to delving into the mysteries of the Island will be well spent. Be seeing you."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/softalkv3n02oct1982|title=Softalk V3n02 Oct 1982|date=October 17, 1982|publisher=Softalk Publishing|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Paula Polley for ''[[Atari Connection]]'' wrote that "Eduware {{sic}} employees report that the CIA uses ''Prisoner 2'' both to interview applicants and train budding spies in terrorist handling techniques" and also claimed that the game had "been used in the psychiatric field to treat patients suffering from paranoia."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Polley |first1=Paula |title=Playing Games with the CIA |journal=Atari Connection |date=Spring 1984 |page=16 |url=https://archive.org/embed/Atari_Connection_Volume_4_Number_1_1984-03_Atari_US |access-date=29 May 2024}}</ref> 

''Prisoner 2'' was voted the fourth most popular fantasy game in the annual ''[[Softalk]]'' reader poll in its 1982 poll.<ref name=Softalk1982Poll>{{cite web |url=http://apple2history.org/appendix/aha/aha82/ |title=Appendix A: Apple II Software Hits, 1982|accessdate=2006-09-25 |last=Weyhrich |first=Steven |authorlink= |date= |year= |format= |work=Apple II History |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref>
