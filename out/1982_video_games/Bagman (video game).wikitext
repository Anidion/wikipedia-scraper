'''''Bagman''''' is a [[platform game]] released in [[Arcade video game|arcades]] by Valadon Automation in 1982.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=6995|name=Bagman}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/visuel/2018/02/15/en-saone-et-loire-sur-les-traces-des-premiers-jeux-video-francais_5257496_4408996.html|title=En Saône-et-Loire, sur les traces des premiers jeux vidéo français|website=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|trans-title=In Saône-et-Loire, on the tracks of the first French video games|access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref>
It was licensed to [[Stern (game company)|Stern]] for U.S. distribution in 1983 and to [[Taito]] in Japan the same year. In [[France]], the game is titled '''''Le Bagnard''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Convict''). ''Bagman'' was followed-up with ''Super Bagman'' in 1984.

==Gameplay==
The objective of the game is to maneuver the bagman through various [[shaft mining|mine shaft]]s, picking up [[money bag]]s and placing them in a [[wheelbarrow]] at the surface of the mine. The player must avoid pursuing [[Security guard|guards]], moving [[ore cart]]s, and descending [[elevator]]s. The player may temporarily [[Stunning|stun]] the guards by striking them with a [[pickaxe]] or by dropping money bags on them when they are below the player on the same [[ladder]]. The player may move between the three screens which make up the [[Level (video gaming)|level]] via shafts and on the surface.

''Bagman'' is played using one 4-way [[joystick]] and one action button. The joystick is also used to jump out of the ore cart. The action button is used to perform the following tasks:

#Pick up and drop money bags
#Pick up and drop pickaxe
#Grab and release the ceiling beam to avoid the ore cart (this can be done while carrying a money bag)
#Placing a money bag in the wheelbarrow
#Pick up and drop the wheelbarrow

Points are scored for each horizontal step the player takes, for each money bag placed in the wheelbarrow, and for each guard stunned.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed the game on their June 15, 1983 issue as the third most-successful new table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型新製品 (New Videos-Table Type)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=214|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 June 1983|page=27|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830615p.pdf#page=14}}</ref> In the United States, it was among the thirteen highest-grossing [[1983 in video games|arcade games of 1983]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=AMOA Votes On Annual Game Awards |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=October 29, 1983 |page=60 |url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox45unse_20/page/68}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Aardvark Action Software published clones for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] as ''Bagitman''. [[Ocean Software]] released a clone for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984 titled ''Gilligan's Gold''.<ref>{{WoS game|id=0002047|name=Gilligan's Gold}}</ref>

In 2010 a French programmer [[Reverse engineering|reconstructed]] [[source code]] from the game to [[Porting|port]] it to modern platforms.<ref>[http://jotd.pagesperso-orange.fr/bagman/index.html bagman] on jotd.pagesperso-orange.fr</ref>
