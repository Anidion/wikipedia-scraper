'''''Pickaxe Pete''''' is a video game released in 1982 as cartridge number 43 for the [[Philips Videopac]] console. It was published in North America for the [[Magnavox Odyssey²]] as '''''Pick Axe Pete!'''''. In Brazil, it was re-branded as '''''Didi na Mina Encantada''''' (''Didi in the Enchanted Mine'') for the Odyssey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Didi Na Mina Encantada!|url=http://odysseymania.classicgaming.com.br/ody9437.html|website=Odyssey Mania|accessdate=December 6, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115192723/http://odysseymania.classicgaming.com.br/ody9437.html|archivedate=November 15, 2011|language=Portuguese}}</ref> ''Pickaxe Pete'' is a [[platform game]] that followed in the wake of ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' before the term existed; a 1982 issue of ''Joystik'' magazine labeled it a "climbing game".<ref name=joystik/> It was designed and programmed by Ed Averett, who wrote the majority of the games for the system.<ref name="giantlist"/> 

A U.S. national competition, "The ''Pick Axe Pete'' Pick-Off," was held at the [[1982 World's Fair|World's Fair]] in October 1982.<ref name="AG">{{cite web|last=Cassidy|first=William|title=Pick Axe Pete - Overview|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16545|website=[[AllGame]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114203714/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16545|archivedate=November 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pick Axe Pete Pick-Off News Coverage|url=http://www.the-nextlevel.com/odyssey2/media/videos/video.php?id=11|website=The Odyssey2 Homepage|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The player controls a miner named Pickaxe Pete who starts in the middle of the screen with a [[pick-axe]]. There are three doors from which boulders are coming, bouncing down the mine-shafts; every time Pete destroys one of these he gains 3 points, although the axe wears out after a while and disappears. When two boulders collide, they explode, and out comes either a pick-axe which floats to the bottom of the screen, a key which floats to the top, or nothing. If Pete has no axe, the player can either jump over boulders (gaining him 1 point), or get to the bottom of the mine to retrieve a new axe (gaining a 5-point bonus). If Pete collects a key then he can enter the doors, which lead him to the next level.<ref name=AG/>

==Reception==
In a December 1982 review, US magazine ''Joystik'' called the game "Odyssey's new entry in the ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' lookalike contest".<ref name=joystik/> The reviewer gave it a 3/10 for graphics and 7/10 for gameplay and concluded:
{{blockquote|text=We're not overly thrilled by the graphics of this game—there's just nothing spectacular about the way it looks. But we think most "level game" fans will enjoy ''Pick Axe Pete''{{'}}s challenging game play.<ref name=joystik/>}}
