The titular player character is based on Lieutenant Colonel and Brevet Major General [[George Armstrong Custer]], a famous American cavalry commander who is most well known for his major defeat and death at the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=282 |title=Custer's Revenge - Classic Gaming |publisher=Classicgaming.gamespy.com |accessdate=November 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416185618/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=282 |archive-date=April 16, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Following the Christmas season of 1982, the rights to American Multiple Industries' games, including ''Custer's Revenge'', were sold off to the adult video game company [[PlayAround]].<ref name=":0"/> Under PlayAround's parent company, Castlespring Enterprises, ''Custer's Revenge'' was re-branded as ''Westward Ho'' for the European market and given slight modifications to its original gameplay. These alterations included simple aesthetic changes such as the darkening in color of the Native American woman's skin tone. PlayAround also made a gender-reversed version of ''Custer's Revenge'' named ''General Retreat''.

The game was universally panned by critics and has been described as one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games ever made]].

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:S CustersRevenge 1.png|thumb|left|An example of gameplay in ''Custer's Revenge'']]
''Custer's Revenge'' is an action video game in which the player controls [[George Armstrong Custer|General Custer]], who must advance through the playing field and avoid arrows in order to rape the Native American woman Revenge, who is tied to a pole on the other side.{{sfn|American Multiple Industries|1982|p=1}} The game consists of four numbered modes of play; modes 1 and 3 are single-player campaigns, while modes 2 and 4 are [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]] multiplayer modes.{{sfn|American Multiple Industries|1982|pp=2—3}} In modes 1 and 2, the player(s) must only avoid arrows, while in modes 3 and 4, [[cacti]] that appear and disappear at random intervals are added as obstacles.{{sfn|American Multiple Industries|1982|p=3}} Custer can move left or right if the joystick is moved in those directions, while shifting the joystick up or down will cause Custer to stop.{{sfn|American Multiple Industries|1982|pp=2—3}}

Custer begins the game with three [[Life (video games)|lives]], which are represented by small cacti on a black stripe at the bottom of the screen.{{sfn|American Multiple Industries|1982|p=1}} If an arrow touches Custer's hat or if Custer comes into contact with a cactus, he loses a life to the tune of "[[Taps (bugle call)|Taps]]". It is possible for Custer to stand in between two arrows and not get hit.{{sfn|American Multiple Industries|1982|p=3}} If Custer successfully reaches Revenge, the player must repeatedly press the fire button for Custer to rape her, which occurs to the [[Charge (fanfare)|"Charge" fanfare]]. Each penetration awards one point,{{sfn|American Multiple Industries|1982|p=1}} and the player earns an extra life for every 50 points. The player(s) can accumulate no more than six lives at any given time.{{sfn|American Multiple Industries|1982|p=4}} For every 50 points scored, Custer returns to his original position on the field, and the speed of the arrows increases. The arrow speed can also be increased by flipping the difficulty switch on the Atari console.{{sfn|American Multiple Industries|1982|pp=4—5}}

== Development and release ==
''Custer's Revenge'' was developed as part of the "Swedish Erotica" series to capitalize on the lack of [[pornography]] available in the medium of video games. The development was deliberately sloppy and rushed because quality did not matter—they only needed a product on store shelves. The overtly racist and sexist themes were chosen to maximize outrage and generate free publicity.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://slate.com/podcasts/decoder-ring/2021/12/custers-revenge-racist-sexist-trolling | title=Custer's Revenge Was Denounced, Protested, and Banned Even Before It Hit Stores | date=December 23, 2021 | access-date=April 30, 2023 | archive-date=April 30, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230430043422/https://slate.com/podcasts/decoder-ring/2021/12/custers-revenge-racist-sexist-trolling | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Reception==
In 1988, computer gaming magazine ''[[Ahoy!]]'' called ''Custer's Revenge'' "an [affront] to common decency", in contrast to more modern and 'tasteful' adult games.<ref>{{cite magazine |title = Centerfold Squares |date = August 1988 |url=https://archive.org/details/ahoy-magazine-56/page/n23/mode/2up |magazine = Ahoy! |publisher = Ion International |last = Katz |first = Arnie |issue = 56 |pages = 24–25}}</ref> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s [[Seanbaby]] placed it as number 9 in his "20 worst games of all time" feature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seanbaby.com:80/nes/egm09.htm |title=Seanbaby's EGM's Crapstravaganza - #9: ''Custer's Revenge'' (Atari 2600) |website=Seanbaby.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707174905/http://www.seanbaby.com/nes/egm09.htm |archive-date=July 7, 2006 |url-status=dead |access-date=April 8, 2007}}</ref>
