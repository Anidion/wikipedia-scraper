==Reception==
In a January 1983, review the British computer games magazine ''TV Gamer'' described the game as "certainly a lot more entertaining than its predecessor, ''[[Basic Math (video game)|Basic Maths]]''".<ref name="TV Gamer" /> A review in the January 1983 edition of ''Tilt'' magazine, a French video games magazine, gave the game 2/6 for graphics and 4/6 for interest, saying that the game might even be of interest to adults.<ref name="Tilt" />

Reviewing the game in 2017 in the book ''The A-Z of Atari 2600 Games: Volume 2'', Kieren Hawken described the game as "nothing more than a curio. An ugly and very unexciting curio at that!" and gave the game 3/10 overall.<ref name="Hawken">{{cite book|last1=Hawken|first1=Kieren|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JE3DwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Math+Grand+Prix%22&pg=PT57|title=The A-Z of Atari 2600 Games: Volume 2|date=2017|publisher=9781785387630|isbn=978-1785387630|access-date=22 February 2021}}</ref>

Menno Deen, in a PhD thesis for the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], cited ''Math Gran Prix'' as "an example of the restrictive nature of early edutainment titles of the 80s", stating that the game's lack of player autonomy does not impart motivation to learn. He furthermore stated that ''Math Gran Prix'' and other mathematics edutainment games: "adopt the instructional model of the explainer and instructor, focusing on skill mastery and correct performances" rather than facilitating experimentation or exploration, the latter two of which he argued are more conducive to learning.<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Deen|first=Menno|title=G.A.M.E.
