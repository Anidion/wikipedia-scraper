==Reception==
Allen Doum reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'':{{quote|The graphics are good, and the sound, animation and scrolling are very well done. Play may begin with either three or five ships at any of six difficulty levels —although I doubt that anyone is expected to play at the higher levels. Even at the lower levels, ''Protector II'' moves fast enough that most players won't have time to realize that what they're doing doesn't make much sense.<ref name="CGW8">{{cite magazine |last=Doum |first=Allen |title=The Atari Arena |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jan–Feb 1983 |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=34–35}}</ref>}}
