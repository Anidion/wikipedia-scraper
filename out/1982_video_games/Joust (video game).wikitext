'''''Joust''''' is an [[action game]] developed by [[WMS Industries|Williams Electronics]] and released in arcades in 1982. While not the first two-player cooperative video game, ''Joust''{{'}}s success and polished implementation popularized the concept. Players assume the role of [[knight]]s armed with [[lance]]s and mounted on large birds (an [[ostrich]] for Player 1, a [[stork]] for Player 2), who must fly around the screen and defeat enemy knights riding [[buzzard]]s. 

[[John Newcomer]] led the development team: Bill Pfutzenreuter, Janice Woldenberg-Miller ({{nee}} Hendricks), [[Python Anghelo]], Tim Murphy, and John Kotlarik. Newcomer aimed to create a flying game, with cooperative two-player gameplay, while avoiding the overdone space theme.

The game was well-received by players and critics, and the mechanics influenced other games. ''Joust'' was ported to numerous home systems and was followed by a more complex and less popular arcade sequel in 1986: ''[[Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:joustarcadegame.png|thumb|left|alt=A horizontal rectangular video game screenshot that is a digital representation of a fictional lava world. A small yellow character on a blue ostrich flies around an area populated with floating brown platforms and red and grey knights green buzzards. At the bottom center is a large brown platform protruding from a pit of red lava. Within the platform is a set of yellow numbers.|The player controls the yellow knight (top center) attempting to defeat enemy knights. The score is in the bottom platform.]]

The game may be played by up to two players simultaneously. Controls for each player consist of a two-position [[joystick]] and a button. The screen contains several platforms, with the left and right edges [[wraparound (video games)|wrapping around]] to each other. Each press of the button flaps the mount's wings; based on the rate at which it is pressed, the knight can ascend or descend at a desired rate or hover in midair. The joystick can be used to steer left and right in midair, or run in a chosen direction if the knight is standing on a platform.<ref name="EG-Coin-Op">{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Electronic Games]] | publisher = Reese Communications | title = Coin-Op Classroom: Some Knights to Remember | first = Bill | last = Heineman | pages = 114–115 | volume = 1 | issue = 17 | date=July 1983}}</ref><ref name="Fever">{{cite book | title = Arcade Fever: The Fan's Guide to The Golden Age of Video Games | first = John | last = Sellers | pages = 94–95 | publisher = [[Running Press]] | date=August 2001 | isbn = 0-7624-0937-1}}</ref>

Each wave consists of several enemy knights, in three types and armed with lances. When a player's knight and an enemy collide, the one whose lance is at a higher vertical level unseats the other; if the lances are at the same height, the two knights rebound from the collision. Each defeated enemy turns into an egg, which the player can pick up for bonus points. After a short period of time, the egg will hatch into a knight of the next higher difficulty level than the defeated one. If this knight acquires a new mount before the player can pick it up, it returns to the game and must be defeated again. The wave ends when all enemy knights have been defeated and their eggs picked up or destroyed.

Later waves introduce further complications and difficulties, such as:
* A chance to earn a bonus for completing a wave without losing any lives
* Destruction of portions of the bottommost platform to expose pools of lava. Any knight or egg that falls in is immediately destroyed.
* The emergence of the Lava Troll, a disembodied hand that can reach up from the lava and try to drag down knights that approach too closely. The player can escape its grip with repeated, rapid flapping.
* Disappearance of some of the midair platforms.
* Waves that begin with eggs scattered all over the screen instead of enemies.
* The appearance of a [[pterodactyl]], which flies randomly around the screen and tries to unseat the players' knights. A precisely timed and aimed lance strike is required to defeat it for bonus points. 

In a two-player game, the players may [[Cooperative video game|cooperatively]] complete the waves or attack each other as desired.<ref name="EG-Coin-Op"/><ref name="Fever" />

One life is lost whenever a player's knight is unseated, or falls or is dragged into the lava. A player's game ends when all lives are lost.

==Development==
''Joust'' was developed by [[WMS Industries|Williams Electronics]], with John Newcomer as the lead designer. The development also included programmer Bill Pfutzenreuter, artists Janice Woldenberg-Miller and [[Python Anghelo]], and audio designers Tim Murphy and John Kotlarik.<ref name="RG-63">{{cite journal|last=Bevan|first=Mike|title=The Making of Joust|url=https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_063#page/n35/mode/2up|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=63|pages=36–41}}</ref> The game features amplified [[monaural]] sound and [[raster graphics]] on a 19-inch color [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT monitor]].<ref name="Arcade-Museum">{{cite web | url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8243 | title = Joust – Videogame by Williams Electronics | publisher = International Arcade Museum | access-date = 2010-07-13}}</ref> Like other Williams arcade games, ''Joust'' was programmed in [[assembly language]].<ref name="Halcyon">{{cite book | title = Halcyon Days: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Games Programmers | editor = James Hague | year = 1997 | chapter = Eugene Jarvis | publisher = Dadgum Games | chapter-url = https://dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/JARVIS.HTM | title-link = Halcyon Days (book)}}</ref> A pack of three [[AA battery|AA batteries]] provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet.<ref name="PriceGuide-1">{{cite book | title = Official Price Guide to Classic Video Games | first = David | last = Ellis | pages = [https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/337 337–338] | chapter = Arcade Classics | publisher = [[Random House]] | isbn = 0-375-72038-3 | year = 2004 | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi | url = https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/337}}</ref><ref name="PriceGuide-2">{{cite book | title = Official Price Guide to Classic Video Games | first = David | last = Ellis | pages = [https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/433 433–437] | chapter = Classic Arcade Game Setup, Restoration, and Repair | publisher = [[Random House]] | isbn = 0-375-72038-3 | year = 2004 | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi | url = https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/433}}</ref> Anghelo stenciled the cabinet artwork on a wooden frame,<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="PriceGuide-1"/> and designed artwork for promotional materials.<ref name="RG-63"/> One such [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] features [[Early Modern English|archaic English]], which was also incorporated into the game's onscreen instructions and game-over message.<ref name="Fever"/>

===Conception===
Following the success of the 1981 game ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]'', Williams searched for new creative staff.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Halcyon"/> John Newcomer, believing video games to be the future of entertainment, left his job as a toy designer to work at Williams, who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list of ideas that included ideas for his top two games, ''[[The War of the Worlds (1984 video game)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and ''Joust''. Technical specifications dictated the selection because his vision of ''The War of the Worlds'' was technologically infeasible, whereas ''Joust'' could be accomplished with hardware already available at Williams.<ref name="RG-63"/> A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using [[Defender (video game)#Hardware|''Defender''{{'}}s hardware]].<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-1">{{cite video game | title= [[Midway Arcade Treasures]] | developer= [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]] | publisher= [[Midway Games]] | date= 2003-11-18 | platform= [[PlayStation 2]] | level= The Inside Story On Joust}}</ref> Newcomer was also inspired by the 1980s film ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joust: An early, genre-bending video game (video)|url=https://nuadox.com/post/617424244562903040/joust-video-game|website=Nuadox|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref>

Newcomer conceived ''Joust'' as a "flying game" with cooperative two-player gameplay, but he did not wish to emulate the popular space theme of previous successful flying games like ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' and ''Defender''. To that end, he made a list of things that could fly: machines, animals, and fictional characters. After evaluating the positive and negative of each idea, Newcomer chose birds for their wide appeal and his familiarity with fantasy and science fiction media featuring birds. To further increase his understanding, Newcomer went to the library to study mythology. He believed that the primary protagonist should ride a majestic bird. The first choice was an eagle, but the lack of graceful land mobility dissuaded him. Instead, he decided that a flying ostrich was more believable than a running eagle. To differentiate between the first and second player characters, the developers picked a stork, believing the proportions were similar to an ostrich while the color difference would avoid confusion among players. Newcomer chose vultures as the main enemies, believing that they would be recognizably evil. Anghelo created concept art of the characters as guidance for further design.<ref name="RG-63"/>

===Design===
{{quote box | width = 35% | quote= At the time ''Joust'' was done I was hoping to get a broader audience who may want to try a different skill. There were already plenty of shooting games they could play. I wanted to break some new ground. I felt I was already giving the player new things to do like having to flap, run and become so adept at flying that it would be the determining factor in how you collided and defeated an enemy. The cleanest thing I could think of to visually determine a winner was height. | source = —John Newcomer on the premise and gameplay of ''Joust''<ref name="RG-63"/>}}

The decision to use birds prompted Newcomer to deviate from the standard eight-direction joystick. He implemented a flapping mechanism to allow players to control the character's ascent and descent. With the vertical direction controlled via the arcade cabinet's button, a two-way joystick was added to dictate horizontal direction.<ref name="RG-63"/> Though other Williams employees were concerned about the design, Newcomer believed that a direct control scheme for flight would strengthen the connection between the player and the character. The combat was devised to allow for higher levels of strategy than traditional shooting games.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> Because flying became an integral gameplay element, he chose to have characters collide as a means of combat, with victory decided by onscreen elevation.<ref name="RG-63"/>

The developers created the game using 96K of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chip storage, which limited the data size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> The ROM size limits also prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters. The graphics are hand-animated [[pixel art]].<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> To animate the birds, Woldenberg-Miller used [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s book ''Animals In Motion'' as a reference. Given the limited memory, she had to balance the number of frames (to minimize file size) while maintaining realistic animation. Woldenberg-Miller chose gray for the buzzards, but changed it to green to optimize the [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] as the developers had only 16 colors to create the entire display. Once the colors were decided for the character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], Newcomer finalized the look of the platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically require larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy. Newcomer prioritized the crucial wing-flap sound above others related to the pterodactyl, collisions, and hatching eggs.<ref name="RG-63"/>

In designing the levels, Newcomer added platforms to the environment after the combat was devised. A static game world was chosen, instead of a scrolling world, to focus on detailed [[Texture (visual arts)|visual textures]] applied to the platforms; the hardware could not easily display the textures while scrolling, and the team believed that displaying the whole environment would aid players. The final game world element designed was a lava pit and a hand reaching out of it to destroy characters too close to the bottom of the screen. Newcomer placed the platforms to optimize Pfutzenreuter's enemy [[artificial intelligence in video games|artificial intelligence]] (AI), which was programmed for attack patterns based partly on platform placements. The knight enemies were designed to exhibit progressively more aggressive behavior. Bounders flew around the environment randomly, occasionally reacting to the protagonist. Hunters sought the player's character in an effort to collide. Shadow Lords flew quickly and closer to the top of the screen; Pfutzenreuter designed them to fly higher when close to the protagonist to increase the Shadow Lord's chances of victory against the player.<ref name="RG-63"/> The pterodactyl was designed to prevent players from idling, and to be difficult to defeat as it was vulnerable only in its open mouth during a specific animation frame and it quickly flies upward at the last moment when approaching a player waiting at the edge of a platform.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-3">{{cite video game | title= [[Midway Arcade Treasures]] | developer= [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]] | publisher= [[Midway Games]] | date= 2003-11-18 | platform= [[PlayStation 2]] | level= Joust Interview Clip #3}}</ref> The game prioritizes its graphics processing to favor the player characters over the enemies, so enemies begin to react more slowly when the number of on-screen sprites increases.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2185/back_to_the_classics_perfecting_.php | title = Back To The Classics: Perfecting The Emulation For Digital Eclipse's Atari Anthology | first = Jeff | last = Vavasour | date = 2005-01-13 | website = Gamasutra | access-date = 2010-10-29}}</ref>

While [[playtest]]ing the game, the team discovered an animation [[Software bug|bug]] they described as a "belly flop".<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-2">{{cite video game | title= [[Midway Arcade Treasures]] | developer= [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]] | publisher= [[Midway Games]] | date= 2003-11-18 | platform= [[PlayStation 2]] | level= Joust Interview Clip #2}}</ref> The flaw allowed players to force the ostrich or stork sprite through an otherwise impassable small gap between two adjacent platforms of very close elevation. Because it provided an interesting method to perform a sneak attack on an opponent below the gap, and because of limited time available,<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> the developers decided to keep the defect as an [[undocumented feature]] rather than fix it.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-2"/>

A second bug, which allows the pterodactyl to be easily defeated, was discovered after the game was first distributed. Newcomer had always designed the game and its AI with each sprite's dimension in mind, but the pterodactyl's sprite had been altered to improve the appearance one day before the game was finished. The new sprite allowed the pterodactyl to be easily defeated an unending number of times. The player could sit on the center ledge, with a single enemy knight caught indefinitely in the hand of the Lava Troll, and kill an unlimited number of pterodactyls simply by turning to face them as they entered the screen. Using this flaw, the player could quickly accumulate a very high score, and a large cache of lives, with no significant skill required. Upon learning of the flaw, Williams shipped a new ROM for the arcade cabinets to assuage distributors' complaints.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-3"/>

[[Atari, Inc.]] published ''Joust'' for its own systems and under the [[Atarisoft]] label for others: [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Atari 5200 Joust Manual |url=https://archive.org/details/Joust_1983_Atari |website=archive.org |date=1983}}</ref> [[Atari 7800]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Atari 7800 Joust Manual |url=https://archive.org/details/Joust_1987_Atari |website=archive.org |date=1987}}</ref> [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Apple II]], and [[Mac (computer)|Mac]]. A port for [[IBM PC compatible]]s was completed, but was never published by Atarisoft.

''Joust'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]—programmed by [[Satoru Iwata]].<ref>{{cite web|first=John |last=Andersen |work=[[Gamasutra]] |publisher=[[UBM plc]] |date=October 9, 2015 |access-date=October 11, 2015 |title=A former mentor recalls the early career of Satoru Iwata |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/254169/A_former_mentor_recalls_the_early_career_of_Satoru_Iwata.php |archive-date=October 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011183727/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/254169/A_former_mentor_recalls_the_early_career_of_Satoru_Iwata.php |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Reception==
Given the peculiar control scheme, Williams was concerned that the game would be unsuccessful, and arcades were hesitant to purchase the game.

Kevin Bowen of [[GameSpy]]'s Classic Gaming wrote that ''Joust'' has an "incredibly stupid" concept but is an appealing game with good controls and competitive gameplay. He said it is "one of the first really fun multiplayer games", differentiated from other contemporary multiplayer games, and a precursor to the [[Deathmatch (video games)|video game deathmatch]].<ref name="ClassicGaming">{{cite web|url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=117 |title=Game of The Week: Joust |first=Kevin |last=Bowen |publisher=Classic Gaming |access-date=2010-07-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821104444/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=117 |archive-date=2009-08-21}}</ref>

''Retro Gamer'' writer Mike Bevan called the game's physics "beautifully" realized, and described ''Joust'' as one of the "most remarkable and well-loved titles" of the Williams library.<ref name="RG-63"/> A ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' writer called the game "weird and wonderful".<ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[Computer and Video Games]] | publisher = [[EMAP]] | date = February 1983 | title = Arcade Action | page = 30}}</ref> Author John Sellers praised the competitive two-player gameplay, and attributed the game's appeal to the flapping mechanism.<ref name="Fever"/> In 2004, Ellis described ''Joust'' as an example of innovative risk absent in the then-current video game industry.<ref name="PriceGuide-1"/>

In retrospect, Newcomer commended Williams's management for taking a risk on him and the game.<ref name="RG-63"/> The game has garnered praise from industry professionals as well. Jeff Peters of GearWorks Games lauded the gameplay, describing it as unique and intuitive. Jeff Johannigman of Fusion Learning Systems praised the flapping mechanism and Kim Pallister of [[Microsoft]] enjoyed the multi-player aspect.<ref name="Coin-OpFavs">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050805/hong_01.shtml | title = Question of the Week Responses: Coin-Op Favorites? | first = Quang | last = Hong | website = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2005-08-05 | access-date = 2009-05-12}}</ref>

==Legacy==
A ''Joust''-themed [[pinball]] table was released in 1983, designed by Barry Oursler and Constantino Mitchell. The game includes artwork and themes from the arcade version. In addition to single player gameplay, it features competitive two-player gameplay with the players on opposing sides of the machine. Fewer than 500 machines were produced.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/>

An arcade sequel, ''[[Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest]]'', was released in 1986. It has similar gameplay with new elements on a vertical screen.<ref>{{cite video game | title= [[Midway Arcade Treasures]] | developer= [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]] | publisher= [[Midway Games]] | date= 2003-11-18 | platform= [[PlayStation 2]] | level= The Inside Story On Joust 2}}</ref>
