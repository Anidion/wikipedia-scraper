'''''Canyon Climber''''' is a video game designed by Steve Bjork and James Garon for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] and published by [[Tandy Corporation]] in 1982.<ref name="giantlist"/> Ports to other home computers were published by [[Datasoft]]. ''Canyon Climber'' is a three-screen [[platform game]] with an [[American Southwest]] theme. Two of the screens are direct analogs of those in ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref name="cocorev"/> 

The game was ported to [[Atari 8-bit computers]] by Tim Ferris, [[Apple II]] by Brian Mountford,<ref name="giantlist"/> and [[PC-6001]]. The box art is by Scott Ross.<ref name="manual"/>

==Gameplay==

''Canyon Climber'' consists of three non-scrolling screens that are endlessly cycled through. In the first, similar to the rivet screen from ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', the goal is to place [[explosive]] charges on both ends of each of four [[bridge]]s, using ladders to climb between them, then trigger a detonator.<ref name=small/> [[Goat]]s pursue the player and can be jumped over. The second screen resembles ''Donkey Kong's'' opening level, with angled platforms and connecting ladders. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] ("Indians" in the manual)<ref name=manual/> on each platform shoot arrows which can be jumped or avoided. The goal is to reach the top. The objective of the third screen is to climb to the top while avoiding bricks dropped by [[bird]]s.<ref name=manual/>

The soundtrack of the first screen is a musical adaptation of the Prelude section from [[Prelude and Fugue in C minor, BWV 847]].

==Reception==
The 1983 book ''The Creative Atari'' stated, "''Canyon Climber'' achieves a cartoon-like atmosphere in the rendering of its various screens, to very pleasing effect," concluding "You will spend a while with ''Canyon Climber''."<ref name="small"/> In a review of four Atari 8-bit [[Datasoft]] games (alongside ''[[Pacific Coast Highway (video game)|Pacific Coast Highway]]'', ''[[Clowns and Balloons]]'', and ''[[Shooting Arcade]]''), Charles Brannon of ''[[Compute!|COMPUTE!]]'' wrote, "the overall animation and execution are perhaps the best of the four."<ref name="brannon"/> ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' wrote, "The details and playability of the game are very good" and rated the graphics a 10 out of 10.<ref name=analog/>

''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' described ''Canyon Climber'' as "not quite as demanding as ''Donkey Kong'', but the concept is appealingly bizarre," and called the game "short-term addictive."<ref name=efun/>  Reviewing the TRS-80 Color Computer version for ''[[Creative Computing]]'', Stephen B. Gray had a different view of the difficulty: "''Canyon Climber'' is a game for the expert or the masochist."<ref name=gray/>

Long after the game's initial release, Keita Iida noted the low difficulty level, calling the game "perfectly suited for beginning players who are just getting into platform/climbing games."<ref name="agh"/> Mark Sabbatini, looking at the Color Computer version, agrees: "as soon as you've completed the levels a few times the challenge is pretty much gone." He also disliked the randomness of the [[rock (geology)|rocks]] and goats, stating "all too often whether you live or die is all about luck and not about skill and planning."<ref name="cocorev"/>

==Legacy==
One section of [[Llamasoft]]'s 2011 ''[[GoatUp]]'' game for iOS is an [[homage (arts)|homage]] to ''Canyon Climber''.<ref name="llamasoft"/>
