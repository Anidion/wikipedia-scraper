'''''Tutti Frutti''''' is an [[action game]] written by Alan M. Newman<ref name=giantlist/> for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published in 1982 by [[Adventure International]].<ref name="ai"/> It was re-released in Germany by QuelleSoft in 1984.<ref name="quelle"/> The game is programmed in [[Atari BASIC]].<ref name=giantlist/>

==Gameplay==
The object of ''Tutti Frutti'' is to eat all the fruits within the time limit. The game sets the stage inside a jungle clearing surrounded by trees, where the player is constantly pursued by deadly bugs as he races against the clock to clear a level. Each stage contains different fruits (bananas, grapes, oranges and plums), trees (which merely hinder the player's movement) and special objects (like ice creams worth a lot of points, but eating it angers the bugs). The player starts with 3 lives, when all are lost the game ends.

==Reception==
''The [[Addison-Wesley]] Book of Atari Software 1984'' gave it an overall rating of "D" and concluded: "In short, the game isn't exciting, is somewhat repetitious, yet offers who like this style of game a challenge on its upper levels."<ref name=wesley/>
