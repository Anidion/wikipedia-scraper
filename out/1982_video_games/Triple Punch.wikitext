'''''Triple Punch''''' (also sold as '''''Knock Out!!''''')<ref name=knock/> is a horizontally-scrolling [[List of maze video games#Grid capture games|grid capture game]] released in arcades by K.K. International (K.K.I.) in 1982.<ref name=klov/> The goal is to color all of the lines on a grid while avoiding or punching pursuers. It was sold both as a conversion kit and as an upright cabinet.<ref name=flyer1/>

==Gameplay==
The player controls a character referred to as a carpenter<ref name=flyer2/> who resembles Mario from the original ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''. Much like ''[[Amidar]]'', the objective is to color the lines around all the rectangles, except in ''Triple Punch'' the game board is larger than the screen and scrolls horizontally.<ref name=klov/> Completing multiple rectangles at the same time doubles or triples the bonus.

Four enemies chase the player: an [[eraser]], a [[ghost]] ("Ottobake"), a [[gorilla]] ("Gorigon"), and a [[fire]].<ref name=ah/> The eraser removes already painted lines. The eraser, ghost, and gorilla can be knocked out with three punches in rapid succession, then an [[ambulance]] takes them away. The fire is always deadly.
