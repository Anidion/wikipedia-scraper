==Gameplay==
[[Image:Adventures_of_Tron_Screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tron must evade enemies and collect items across four floors]]

In the game the player controls Tron, who has to avoid a variety of enemies whilst navigating a building with four floors. The upper floors are accessible via two [[Elevator|elevators]] on the left and right of the screen. The player can jump down one floor by pressing down, and can jump up in the air by pressing the fire button. A gap with a poll in the center of the floor will drop the player down to the ground level, and must be jumped across in order to get to the other side.

Enemies patrol each floor (all of which are biased on aspects of the film), including the Recognizers and Grid Bugs which travel in groups of three, and the Tanks, which are much larger and fire fast moving projectiles. A unique enemy are the Solar Sailers, which fly in the air, and don’t kill the player on contract, but rather push them backwards, impeding progress and potentially putting the player into harms way. The player can’t fight back, and thus must evade these enemies by jumping over them or dropping down to a lower floor. The player must collect floating Bits which fly near the ceiling of each floor (the higher the floor the Bit is collected on, the higher the point total). <ref>{{cite web |url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareID=806 |title=AtariAge - Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Adventures of Tron (M Network) |website=atariage.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020125101035/http://www.atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareID=806 |archive-date=2002-01-25}} </ref>

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=June 2023}}
The game received fairly positive reviews from critics. The game received praise for its graphics and sound, as well as its controls and platforming design, but the gameplay received some criticism, which was viewed as a bit repetitive and at times even frustrating.<ref>[http://www.gamefreaks365.com/review.php?artid=622 Gamefreaks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211082903/http://www.gamefreaks365.com/review.php?artid=622 |date=February 11, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/a2600/review/R18031.html Gamefaqs]</ref><ref>[http://www.atarihq.com/reviews/2600/adventures_of_tron.html Atari HQ]</ref><ref>[http://abscape.org/legeek/r_advtron.htm AB Scape]</ref>
