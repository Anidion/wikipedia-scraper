'''''Shamus''''' is a [[shooter game|shooter]] with light [[action-adventure game]] elements written by [[Cathryn Mataga]] (credited as William Mataga) and published by [[Synapse Software]]. The original [[Atari 8-bit computers|Atari 8-bit computer]] version was released on disk and tape in 1982.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stanton |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Wells |first2=Robert P |last3=Rochowansky |first3=Sandra |title=The Addison-Wesley book of Atari software, 1983 |date=1983 |publisher=Book Co. |page=141 |language=English|oclc=9613138}}</ref> According to Synapse co-founder Ihor Wolosenko, ''Shamus'' made the company famous by giving it a reputation for quality.<ref name=interview/> "[[Funeral March of a Marionette]]", the theme song from ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', plays on the title screen.

The player moves through four [[flip-screen]] levels, each containing 32 rooms, shooting attackers and collecting keys for locked areas while searching for the exit. ''Shamus'' was inspired by the 1980 ''[[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]'' arcade video game.

The game was ported to the [[Apple II]], [[VIC-20]], [[Commodore 64]], [[TRS-80 Color Computer]], [[TI-99/4A]], and [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]. Several of these were published by [[Atarisoft]]. It was later sold on cartridge by [[Atari Corporation]] following the launch of the [[Atari XEGS]] in 1987.

''Shamus'' was followed by a sequel in 1983, ''[[Shamus: Case II]]'', with the same characters but different gameplay. In 1999, Mataga released a [[Video game remake|remake]] for the [[Game Boy Color]] and later both ''Shamus'' and ''Shamus: Case II'' for [[iOS]].

==Gameplay==
Inspired by the arcade game ''[[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]'',<ref name=interview>{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Dewitt |title= Ihor Wolosenko (Synapse Software) |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v2n1/interview.html |journal=Antic |date=April 1983}}</ref><ref name="cgw"/> the objective of the game is to navigate the eponymous [[robot]]ic detective through a 4-skill level, 128-room maze of electrified walls.  The ultimate goal at the end of this journey is "The Shadow's Lair". ''Shamus'' differs from ''Berzerk'' in having a persistent world instead of rooms that are randomly generated each time they are entered. There are also items to collect: bottles containing extra lives, mystery question marks, and keys which open exits.

Opposing the player are a number of robotic adversaries, including spiral drones, robo droids and snap jumpers. Shamus is armed with "Ion SHIVs", SHIV being an acronym for Short High Intensity Vaporizer, and is able to hurl up to two at a time at his enemies.  Like many other games in this genre, touching an electrified wall results in instantaneous death. Upon the completion of each level, the gameplay speeds up, increasing the chances of running into a wall.

The main gameplay involves clearing the room of all enemies, picking up special items on the way and then leaving through an exit. Upon returning to the room, the enemies are regenerated and returned to their original positions. In exactly the same way as ''Berzerk'', the player will be attacked if they spend too much time in one room. In this case, the Shadow himself emerges from off-screen and hops directly at Shamus, unhindered by the walls. If shot, the Shadow briefly freezes in place.

The combination of locks and keys requires the player to complete each of its four levels in a particular order. To complete the game in its entirety would take several hours,{{cn|date=February 2018}} which combined with the lack of a pause function (except on the IBM version), the necessity of remembering the location of dozens of rooms and keys, and the frenetic gameplay, meant that this was extremely difficult to accomplish.

Each maze layout is named after a famous fictional detective or secret agent.

==Ports==
The VIC-20 port is 8K and contains only 32 rooms, unlike the 128 in every other version.

==Reception==
''Shamus'' sold 60,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jon|last=Basher|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/103873104/the-berkeley-gazette/|title=Video firm is aiming high|newspaper=[[Berkeley Gazette]]|page=4|date=August 30, 1983|accessdate=June 17, 2022|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

In 1982, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' reviewed the Atari original, praising the animation and the "vastly superior graphics" over ''Berzerk'', but complaining of the inability to pause the action and of a bug in the speed control. ''Shamus'' was considered "the most addictive" of the four games reviewed.<ref name="cgw">{{cite magazine |last1=Doum |first1=Allen |title=Four for the Atari |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=November 1982 |volume=2 |issue=6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_2.6/page/n21 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_2.6}}</ref>
