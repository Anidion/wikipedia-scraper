The hero is Mac Steele, an archaeologist who needs to find the Mask of the Sun in order to obtain an antidote to a poison that afflicts him from an artifact that he found. The game mostly takes place in [[Mexico]] in the [[Aztec]] ruins. Gameplay is text-based; however there are some graphics, including simple animations.
