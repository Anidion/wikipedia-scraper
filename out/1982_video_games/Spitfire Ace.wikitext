'''''Spitfire Ace''''' is a [[combat flight simulator]] video game created and published by [[MicroProse]] in 1982 shortly after it was founded. It was one of the first video games designed and programmed by [[Sid Meier]], originally developed for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and ported to the [[Commodore 64]] and [[IBM PC compatibles]] (as a [[self-booting disk]]) in 1984. The game followed on the heel's of Meier's ''Hellcat Ace'', also from 1982 and for the Atari 8-bit computers.

==Gameplay==
The game puts the player in the pilot's seat during [[World War II]].  The player defends [[London]] during [[The Blitz]] while flying the [[Supermarine Spitfire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/spitfire-ace|title=Spitfire Ace for Atari 8-bit (1982) - MobyGames|last=|first=|date=|website=MobyGames|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915034205/http://www.mobygames.com/game/spitfire-ace|archive-date=2017-09-15|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref> The game offers 15 different scenarios that include France, Malta and [[D-Day]].

==Development==
[[Sid Meier]] developed ''Spitfire Ace'' as a modified version of ''[[Hellcat Ace]]'', another game he programmed, released earlier that same year. In his 2020 memoir, Meier described ''Spitfire Ace'' as "the kind of game we'd probably call an [[expansion pack]] today. It used the same code base as ''Hellcat Ace'', but moved the battle scenarios from the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific]] to the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater]]."<ref>{{cite book|last=Meier|first=Sid|author-link=Sid Meier|date=2020|title=Sid Meier's Memoir!: A Life in Computer Games|publisher=[[W.
