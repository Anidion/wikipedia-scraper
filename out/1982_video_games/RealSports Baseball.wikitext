'''''RealSports Baseball''''' (also known as '''''Super Baseball''''' and simply as '''''Baseball''''') is a 1982 [[sports video game]] developed and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] originally for the [[Atari 2600]]. It was also launched on the [[Atari 5200]] and [[Atari 7800|7800]] machines. A version for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was in development, but cancelled.<ref name="Retro Gamer" />

The game was developed in response to an aggressive marketing campaign by Mattel and released as part of the ''[[RealSports]]'' game series. The Atari 5200 version of the game was positively reviewed both contemporarily and retrospectively. The game has been re-released by Atari SA who inherited the intellectual property in the game.

==Development==
The game was part of a series of games released under the ''RealSports'' title for the Atari 2600, including ''[[RealSports Football]]'', ''[[RealSports Volleyball]]'', and ''[[RealSports Soccer]]''.<ref name="Best 2600 Sports">{{cite news |title=Best 2600 Sports |url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_Illustrated_1983-04_Ion_International_US/page/n59/mode/2up?q=%22Realsports%22 |access-date=February 24, 2021 |work=Videogaming Illustrated |date=April 1983 |page=60}}</ref><ref name="Stanton et al" /> The series was conceived as an answer to [[Mattel Electronics]]'s aggressive marketing campaign fronted by [[George Plimpton]], in which they compared the graphically and gameplay-wise dated Atari 2600 sports games, including Atari's 1978 baseball game ''[[Home Run (video game)|Home Run]]'', to their more advanced [[Intellivision]] counterparts.<ref name="Retro Gamer" /><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2007/06/gallery-game-history/ |title=Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming |access-date=March 2, 2021 |date=June 15, 2007 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}</ref>

The originally-released ''RealSports Baseball'' included a number of [[software bug]]s that impaired the quality of play. As a result, an improved version for the 2600 platform entitled ''Super Baseball'' was subsequently released in March 1989, fixing some, but not all, of the errors. ''Super Baseball'' also included some graphical improvements. A version with "Voice Controller" support, an unreleased [[Voice user interface|voice command device]] for the 2600, was announced at the 1983 [[Summer Consumer Electronics Show]] with a 1983 release date.<ref name="Lapetino" /><ref>{{cite journal |last=Chin |first=Kathy |title=Atari introduces keyboard with software packs & peripherals |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |date=July 11, 1983 |page=13 |volume=5 |issue=28 |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |issn=0199-6649 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wi8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13 |access-date=March 1, 2021}}</ref> In this version the pitching, the batting, and the fielding utilized the [[Atari CX40 joystick|regular joystick]], the voice commands could be only used to throw the ball to the bases.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hudson |first=Lou |title=Here's the latest on video game scene |journal=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |date=May 19, 1984 |page=123 |publisher=[[McClatchy]] |issn=0889-0013 |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/638209668/?terms=%22Realsports%20baseball%22&match=1 |access-date=March 1, 2021 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

With the launch of the Atari 5200 and Atari 7800 platforms new versions of the game were also developed for them.<ref name="Weiss">{{cite book |last1=Weiss |first1=Bret |title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide |date=December 20, 2011 |publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers |isbn=9780786487554 |pages=97, 118, 147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&dq=%22Realsports+Baseball%22&pg=PA147 |access-date=February 20, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Lapetino">{{cite book |last1=Lapetino |first1=Tim |title=Art of Atari |date=October 26, 2016 |publisher=Dynamite Entertainment |isbn=9781524101060 |pages=180–181, 325 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z50oDAAAQBAJ&q=Realsports+baseball&pg=PA349 |access-date=February 20, 2021}}</ref> Jim Andreasen started to work on the 5200 version of ''RealSports Baseball'' right after he finished ''RealSports Football'', but he later shelved the project citing burn out. After that Keithen Hayenga was assigned to finish the game, but because he wasn't satisfied with the graphics, he chose to start over the project from scratch. He was allowed to use an additional 8 [[kilobyte]] of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] space to put in voice, he used half of it for additional game logic. Andreasen later helped to finish off the gameplay.<ref name="Retro Gamer" /><ref>{{cite podcast |url=https://ataripodcast.libsyn.com/antic-interview-95-keithen-hayenga-5200-tempest |title=ANTIC Interview 95 - Keithen Hayenga, 5200 Tempest |website=ANTIC: The Atari 8-bit Podcast |host=Randy Kindig |date=November 12, 2015 |time=17:00–20:42, 37:41–39:12 |access-date=March 4, 2021}}</ref> The game was written in [[machine code]].<ref name="Stanton et al" /> A version for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was also in development, but never released.

Despite the significantly improved graphics hardware of the Atari 7800, the 7800 version of the game features downgraded graphics and sounds compared to the 5200 version. It also has more limited gameplay and it's generally buggier.<ref name="Retro Gamer" />

The cover art for the original 2600 release was done by Michel Allaire, whilst that for the 5200 release was drawn by D. Smith. Warren Chang created the interior artwork used in the manuals of both the 2600 and 5200 editions.<ref name="Lapetino" /> The game's 1982 television advertising campaign was fronted by [[Oakland Athletics]] manager [[Billy Martin]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ladyem McDivitt |first1=Anne |title=Hot Tubs and Pac-Man: Gender and the Early Video Game Industry in the United States (1950s–1980s) |date=October 12, 2020 |publisher=[[De Gruyter]] |isbn=9783110664461 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUYCEAAAQBAJ&dq=%22billy+martin%22+%22atari%22&pg=PA40 |access-date=March 4, 2021}}</ref>

In this game Atari improved on ''[[Home Run (video game)|Home Run]]'', their previous baseball-themed game for the 2600 platform, by including a baseball diamond, fly-balls, throwing of the ball by fielders to tag the opposing player out, and other traditional features of the sport of baseball.<ref name="Weiss" /> Players are able to use the joystick to select the kind of swing the batter will make, with [[Bunt (baseball)|bunts]], grounders, and fly-balls all possible.<ref name="Katz1">{{cite news |last1=Katz |first1=Arnie |title=The Summer Game Goes Electronic |url=https://archive.org/details/ElectronicGames/Electronic%20Games%20Issue%2018%20%28August%201983%29/page/n55/mode/2up?q=baseball |access-date=February 24, 2021 |work=Electronic Games |issue=18 |date=August 1983 |pages=49–52}}</ref> The 2600 and 5200 versions of the game features four variations of play, with the player able to select between single-play and two-player and between the batter being able to strike any ball or only being able to hit balls from within the [[strike zone]].<ref name="Stanton et al" /> The Atari 5200 version featured the voice of an electronic announcer calling the plays.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Kunkel |editor1-first=Bill |editor1-link=Bill Kunkel (journalist) |title=1984 Software Encyclopedia |date=1984 |publisher=Reese Communications Inc. |pages=102–103 |url=https://archive.org/details/1984_Software_Encyclopedia_Number_2_1983_Reese_Communications_US/page/n101/mode/2up?q=baseball |access-date=February 24, 2021}}</ref>

==Reception==
A review of the original ''RealSports Baseball'' in the August 1983 issue of ''[[Electronic Games]]'' magazine praised the game, comparing it positively to ''Home Run'', saying that "Thanks to ''RealSports Baseball'', Atari 2600 owners finally have a game they can love".<ref name="Katz1" /> A review of the 2600 version in the August-September 1983 issue of ''Vidiot'' magazine was critical of the game, describing the game as "lots better than 'Home Run', but not much more real".<ref name="Vidiot">{{cite news |last1=Knight |first1=Bill |title=RealSports Baseball |url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/magazines/vidiot/vidiot_augsep83.pdf |access-date=March 1, 2021 |work=Vidiot |volume=1 |issue=5 |publisher=CREEM Publications |date=August-September 1983 |page=15}}</ref> The 1984 ''Book of Atari Software'' described ''RealSports Baseball'' for the 2600 platform as "not the best baseball game" but "very playable" and "not a disappointing cartridge at all", and gave the game an overall score of "B".<ref name="Stanton et al">{{cite book |last1=Stanton |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Wells |first2=Robert P. |last3=Rochowansky |first3=Sandra |last4=Mellin |first4=Michael |title=The Book of Atari Software 1984 |date=1984 |publisher=The Book Company |isbn=0912003049 |page=383 |url=https://archive.org/details/the-book-of-atari-software-1984/page/n383/mode/2up |access-date=February 20, 2021}}</ref> A review in the January 1984 edition of ''[[Videogaming Illustrated|Video and Computer Gaming Illustrated]]'' described the game as a game that "gives you the opportunity to play strategically".<ref name="Herman">{{cite news |last1=Herman |first1=Leonard |title=The Strategic Scenario |url=https://archive.org/details/Video_and_Computer_Gaming_Illustrated_1984-01_Ion_International_US/page/n63/mode/2up?q=%22Realsports+baseball%22 |access-date=February 24, 2021 |work=Video and Computer Gaming Illustrated |publisher=Ion International |date=January 1984 |page=64}}</ref> In March 1984 the staff and writers of ''Video and Computer Gaming Illustrated'' also awarded the game their Vista prize in the category Best 2600 Sports, an accolade it shared jointly with ''[[Super Challenge Baseball]]''.<ref name="Vista award">{{cite news |title=Presenting: The first annual Vista awards! |url=https://archive.org/details/Video_and_Computer_Gaming_Illustrated_1984-03_Ion_International_US/page/n23/mode/2up?q=%22Realsports+baseball%22 |access-date=February 24, 2021 |work=Video and Computer Gaming Illustrated |date=March 1984 |page=25}}</ref>

In the 2007 book ''Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide'', Brett Weiss reviewed the original ''RealSports Baseball'' negatively, criticising the bugs. Weiss reviewed the subsequently-released ''Super Baseball'' version more positively as some of the bugs had been fixed. The Atari 5200 version of ''RealSports Baseball'' was positively received by Weiss, who said it "rival[ed] ''[[Pete Rose Baseball]]'' as the best baseball game ever made for any Atari system".<ref name="Weiss" /> Kieren Hawken reviewing the game in ''The A–Z of Atari 8-bit Games: Volume 4'' in 2021 praised the "colourful and well animated" graphics and the "very good" sound effects and sound, giving the game 7/10 overall.<ref name="Hawken">{{cite book |last1=Hawken |first1=Kieren |title=The A–Z of Atari 8-bit Games: Volume 4 |date=2021 |publisher=Andrews UK |isbn=9781789824865 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6saEAAAQBAJ&dq=%22realsports+Baseball%22&pg=PT126 |access-date=February 21, 2021}}</ref>
