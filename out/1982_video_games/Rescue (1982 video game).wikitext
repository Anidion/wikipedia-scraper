'''''Rescue''''' is a [[twin-stick shooter]] designed by [[Chris Oberth]] and released by [[Stern (game company)|Stern]] as an arcade video game in 1982.<ref>{{KLOV game|name=Rescue|id=9299}}</ref> The player flies a helicopter over the open sea to rescue stranded paratroopers from enemy forces and sharks.<ref name="sharpe198306"/> As the player-controlled helicopter flies left and right, the cloud layers move at different rates, giving a [[parallax scrolling]] effect.

==Gameplay==
The player pilots a [[helicopter]] over a body of water. [[Paratrooper]]s drop from the top of the screen and land in the water. They can be picked up by carefully hovering so a short ladder drops, and they climb in. Being slightly too low and touching the water loses a life. A falling paratrooper is killed if it hits the player's helicopter.

Enemy helicopters attack the player and can be shot by moving the second joystick. The falling wreckage is deadly. A "bomb" button releases a projectile straight down for destroying sharks and submarines targeting paratroopers waiting for rescue.<ref name="sharpe198306"/>

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Games]]'' reviewed ''Rescue'' in 1982. The reviewer commented: "With ''Rescue'', everything ties together in a neat package that's not only fun to play, but increasingly challenging the further you're able to go into the mission."<ref name="sharpe198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_16_1983-06_Reese_Communications_US/page/n93/mode/2up | title=Insert Coin Here | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | last=Sharpe |first=Roger C. | pages=96â€“97}}</ref>
