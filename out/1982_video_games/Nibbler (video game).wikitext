'''''Nibbler''''' is an arcade [[Snake (video game genre)|snake]] [[maze video game]] released in 1982 by [[Chicago]]-based developer [[Rock-Ola]]. The player navigates a snake through an enclosed maze, consuming objects, and the length of the snake increases with each object consumed. The game was the first to include nine scoring digits, allowing players to surpass one billion points.<ref name="kotaku"/>

The arcade game was distributed in Japan by [[Taito]] in 1983.<ref name="MAD">{{cite web |title=Nibbler |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/id/M731349 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |access-date=31 May 2021}}</ref> Home versions were published in 1983 by [[Datasoft]] for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]]<ref name=mania/> and [[Apple II]].

==Gameplay==
''Nibbler'' is a maze-and-munch game, among many others which followed ''[[Pac-Man]]'',<ref name="grande"/> but the game features no enemies, and a life is lost only when the snake bites itself.<ref name="smith">{{cite web|url=http://allincolorforaquarter.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-story-of-rock-ola-video-games-part-3.html|title=The Story of Rock-Ola Video Games (Part 3)|first=Keith|last=Smith|work=The Golden Age Arcade Historian|date=October 12, 2012|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Nibbler World Record Attempt at MagFest 2009.JPG|thumb|right|World-record attempts by Tim McVey and Dwayne Richard at [[MAGFest]] in 2009]]

''Nibbler'' is the first video game to feature a nine-digit scoring system allowing players to score one billion points.<ref name="kotaku"/> The first to achieve this feat was a seventeen-year-old named Tim McVey, who scored 1,000,042,270 points on January 17, 1984, while playing continuously for 44 hours over two days at [[Walter Day]]'s [[Twin Galaxies]] arcade in [[Ottumwa, Iowa]].<ref name="kotaku">{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/man-vs-snake-documents-one-mans-obsession-with-nibbler-1788109519 | title=''Man vs. Snake'' Documents One Man's Obsession with ''Nibbler'' |first=Ethan|last=Gach|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=October 22, 2016| accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> A local news crew arrived to film him on location as he closed in on the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&id=394|title=The 1,000,000,000 Point Game|first=Paul|last=Stokstad|work=Computer Games Magazine|date=July 1984|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311214330/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&id=394|archivedate=March 11, 2007}}</ref> McVey stated in a 2016 interview that he quit playing of his own accord due to exhaustion after setting the mark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdreport.com/2016/06/19/filmquest-interview-tim-mcvey-dwayne-richards-man-vs-snake/|title=Filmquest Interview: Tim McVey and Dwayne Richard on ''Man vs. Snake''|first=Fred|last=Topel|work=Nerd Report|date=June 19, 2016|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> For his achievement, McVey, an Ottumwa native, had the day of January 28, 1984 declared in his honor.<ref name="smith"/>  He additionally received his own ''Nibbler'' machine as a prize, which he later gave to a rival arcade in exchange for two hundred dollars in game [[Token coin|token]]s.<ref name="bearman">{{cite web|url=http://laweekly.blogs.com/joshuah_bearman/2009/01/because-its-there-.html|title=Because It's There|first=Joshuah|last=Bearman|work=[[LA Weekly|laweekly.blogs.com]]|date=January 3, 2009|accessdate=June 13, 2017}}</ref> 

In September 1984, Italian player Enrico Zanetti topped McVey with a 1,001,073,840 score, but it was not officially recognized by Twin Galaxies,<ref name="Zanetti">{{cite web | url=http://www.retrouprising.com/index.php?pid=enrico_zanetti | title=Interview with ''Nibbler'' Billionaire Enrico Zanetti | work=Retro Uprising | date=January 31, 2002 | accessdate=December 16, 2013 }}</ref> who ultimately stopped verifying record scores for the game altogether; however, this score was grandfathered in retroactively as a historical record due to a new ruling that permitted significant and well-documented media coverage, although the former record was only officialized after McVey took back the record from Rick Carter.<ref name="press"/> In September 2008, Dwayne Richard of [[Grande Prairie]], [[Alberta]], gained media attention when he fell short in his attempt to become the first player since McVey to officially surpass one billion points.<ref name="grande">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyheraldtribune.com/2008/09/15/world-record-attempt-foiled|title=World record attempt foiled|work=[[Grande Prairie Daily Herald-Tribune]]|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}</ref>

McVey's mark consequently stood for nearly three decades before it was surpassed twice, including once by Richard in 2009,<ref name="bearman"/> but McVey was still recognized by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the official record holder because others' scores were never submitted for verification.<ref name="press">{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/chattanooganow/movies/story/2016/jun/23/mvs-snake/372220/|title=Documentary 'Man vs. Snake' explores quest for gaming immortality|first=Hayden|last=Seay|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|date=June 23, 2016|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> Rick Carter of [[Glen Burnie, Maryland]] officially claimed the new world record with a score of 1,002,222,360 on July 31, 2011.<ref name="kotaku"/> McVey regained the mark on December 25, 2011, with a score of 1,041,767,060.<ref name="press"/>
On 01/05/2023 the Italian player Alessandro Porro from Triest, totaling a score of 1,233,326,800 after 51 hours and 55 minutes.The performance is broadcast live on Twitch and the new world record comes a few days later formed by Twin Galaxies.
