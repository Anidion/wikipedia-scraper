Michael Blanchet for ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' reviewed the Coleco Adam version, stating: "After playing ''Buck Rogers'' a scant fifty times, I noticed an ever-increasing number of on-screen glitches. I can only presume they were caused by tape wear".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_02_No_05_1984-03_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/page/n51/mode/2up|title=Electronic Fun with Computer & Games - Vol 02 No 05 (1984-03)(Fun & Games Publishing)(US)|date=March 16, 1984|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
