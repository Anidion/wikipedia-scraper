'''''Word Zapper''''' is an [[Atari 2600]] game written by Henry Will IV<ref name=giantlist/> and published under the Vidtec label of [[U.S. Games]] in 1982. ''Word Zapper'' combines spelling exercises with action gaming, as the player must shoot letters that scroll across the top of the screen to complete words.<ref name="SG"/>

==Gameplay==
The player controls a spaceship-like "Zapper" which can move about the screen and shoot up, left, and right. The objective is to shoot the letters that spell the current word, in order, while shooting or avoiding [[asteroid]]s in the lower portion of the screen.<ref name="manual">{{cite web |title=Word Zapper Manual |url=https://archive.org/details/Word_Zapper_1982_US_Games |website=archive.org |year=1982 |publisher=U.S. Games}}</ref> There are four types of asteroids, and each has a different effect if it comes into contact with the Zapper. The "Doomsday" asteroid ends the game. The "Scroller" asteroid mixes up the scrolling letters for five seconds. The "Zonker" and "Bonker" asteroids knock the Zapper to the side.

The game ends after being hit by a doomsday asteroid, after the 99 second timer runs down, or the ultimate goal of completing three words.<ref name=manual/>

==Reception==
Richard A. Edwards reviewed ''Word Zapper'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 59.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Edwards |first=Richard A. |date=January 1983 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=59|pages=46, 48}}</ref> Edwards commented that "It is difficult to make a statement concerning recommendation. ''Word Zapper'' is innovative enough to draw attention at first, but it will depend on the individual gamer whether another arcade shooting match with letters is worth the price tag."<ref name="SG"/>

In the 1983 Arcade Awards, ''Word Zapper'' was one of two runners-up for the "Most Innovative Videogame" category.<ref>{{cite journal |title=1983 Arcade Awards |journal=Electronic Games |date=January 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=23â€“24 |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US/page/n21 |last1=Katz |first1=Arnie |last2=Kunkel |first2=Bill}}</ref>
