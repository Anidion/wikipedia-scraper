'''''Claim Jumper''''' is a video game written by Gray Chang for  [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published by [[Synapse Software]] in 1982.<ref name=giantlist/> It is primarily designed as a two-player competitive game, but includes a separate [[shoot 'em up]] mode for either one or two players.<ref name=manual/>

==Gameplay==
''Claim Jumper'' is a game in which the player is a cowboy collecting gold bars.<ref name="CGW8"/>

==Development==
Gray Chang previously wrote the two-player competitive game ''Dog Daze'' for the [[Atari Program Exchange]]. After ''Claim Jumper'', he designed two more games for two simultaneous players: ''Dog Daze Deluxe'' and ''Bumpomov's Dogs''.

Chang kept a notebook while writing ''Claim Jumper'' which contains nearly 200 pages of code, flowcharts, technical details, and graph paper sketches of the game art.<ref name="dev">{{cite web |last1=Chang |first1=Gray |title=Claim Jumper Development Notebook |year=1982 |url=https://archive.org/details/Atari_Claim_Jumper_Development_Notes}}</ref>

==Reception==
Allen Doum reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The graphics and animation in ''Claim Jumper'' are very good but, while there are sound cues for most game actions, the sounds are not very imaginative. There aren't many interactively competitive two player arcade-style games, so it is nice to see a company like Synapse release a game like ''Claim Jumper'' which fills that need so nicely."<ref name="CGW8">{{cite magazine |last=Doum |first=Allen |title=The Atari Arena |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jan–Feb 1983 |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=34–35}}</ref>
