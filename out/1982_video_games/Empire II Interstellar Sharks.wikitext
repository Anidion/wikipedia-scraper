'''''Empire II: Interstellar Sharks''''' is a 1982 video game published by [[Edu-Ware|Edu-Ware Services Inc]]. It is the second game in the ''Empire'' trilogy, preceded by ''[[Empire I: World Builders]]'' (1981) and followed by ''[[Empire III: Armageddon]]'' (1983).<ref name="Tringham2014">{{cite book |last=Tringham|first=Neal Roger |title=Science Fiction Video Games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QH3SBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA154 |date=10 September 2014 |publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4822-0389-9|pages=153–154}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Set at the height of the galactic Imperial civilization, 1200 years after the setting of ''World Builders'', the player chooses one of three classes (pilot, businessman, or diplomat) and attempts to accumulate enough wealth to outfit a private spacecraft in order to travel to Triskelion—the capital of the Empire—and confront the Empress.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Stephenson |first=Linda |date=February 1983 |title=Futuristic Finance |magazine=[[InCider]] |publisher=1001001 Inc. |location=Peterborough, NH |department=New Software |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=171}}</ref>

==Reception==
A review in ''Softalk'' concluded:<blockquote>''Interstellar Sharks'' plays considerably better than the first game in the series. However, be prepared to spend an enormous amount of time developing each character. Psychologically, ''Interstellar Sharks'' wears a player down fast. The sheer weight of the simulated red tape and procedural hindrances slows the game down to a crawl just when you feel like soaring. Still, if you persevere to the end, you'll feel a real sense of accomplishment—rare in computer games but common to Edu-Ware's products.<ref name="Tommervik1983">{{cite magazine |editor-last=Comstock Tommervik |editor-first=Margot |date=August 1983 |title=Interstellar Sharks |url=https://archive.org/details/softalkv3n12aug1983 |magazine=[[Softalk]] |publisher=Softalk Publishing, Inc. |location=North Hollywood, California |volume=3 |issue=12 |department=Marketalk Reviews |page=[https://archive.org/details/softalkv3n12aug1983/page/168 168] |issn=0274-9629 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref></blockquote>
