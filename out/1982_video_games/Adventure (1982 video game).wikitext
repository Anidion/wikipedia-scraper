==Gameplay==
The game is a [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]], being an attempted reconstruction of the original ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' computer game, although it is not very faithful to the original mainframe version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beebgames.com/games.php?company=2|title=The BBC Games Archive - digital memories|accessdate=2010-09-28|first=C.|last=Boylan|publisher=The BBC Games Archive}}</ref>

In this version of the game, the player must rescue a princess from the Magic Caverns.<ref name="cassette1983">{{cite journal |year=1983|title = Acorn Electron cassette inlay |journal=Adventure}}</ref> There are over a hundred different locations and many problems must be solved in order to achieve this goal.<ref name="cassette1983"/> The game supports one or two word commands and the most useful commands are available via function key shortcuts e.g. INVENTORY, CHECK SCORE etc.<ref name="cassette1983"/>

The game's instructions do not reveal all valid verbs, as it is left to the player to discover them.<ref name="cassette1983"/>  The instructions also mention that the [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] folk tales may provide useful hints to the player.<ref name="cassette1983"/>

The Acorn Atom version of the game requires 12K of RAM<ref name="c&vg1"/> and is unrelated to another Acorn Atom title (a text adventure game engine), also called ''Adventure'' from Acornsoft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.casema.nl/hhaydn/images/adve.gif|title=The Acorn Atom Review|accessdate=2010-09-28|first=H.|last=Haydn|publisher=Atom Users Club (Netherlands)}}</ref>
