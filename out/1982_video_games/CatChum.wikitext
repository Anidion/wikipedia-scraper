'''''CatChum''''' is a text-only clone of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' written for the [[CP/M|CP/M operating system]] and made to be operated on the early [[Kaypro]] line of luggable computers.

CatChum was made within the limitations of Kaypro's early text-only computers. As a result, the maze is made from a series of dashes and other punctuation marks. The [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]] character is a letter '''C''', which goes from upper to lower case intermittently (to simulate a chomping Pac-Man). The four [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|ghosts]] are capital '''A'''s (which turn to lowercase '''m'''s when the CatChum Pac-Man chomps a power-pellet, capital '''M'''s when the effect is about to end), and the "fruits" are represented by dollar signs.  One of the major down sides of this clone is that Kaypros of that era did not have the ability to flip the text characters. As a result, even when the character is chomping pellets on his left, for example, his chomping mouth is still on the right.

There is no sound. Instead, flashing text messages appear every now and then saying things like "Get Set!", "Get Ready!" or "Go for it!"

Along with ''[[Star Trek (1971 video game)|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Aliens (Kaypro video game)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Ladder (video game)|Ladder]]'', ''CatChum'' was one of the games that came with the software bundle of the early Kaypro computers.

CatChum was written by [[Yahoo Software]] of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=CatChum|journal=BAM Publications|year=1985|volume=2|series=MicroTimes|pages=48â€“49}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=InfoWorld|date=October 1983|volume=5|issue=44|pages=109|title=Review: Kaypro 10|url={{Google books|id=2y8EAAAAMBAJ|page=109|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>
