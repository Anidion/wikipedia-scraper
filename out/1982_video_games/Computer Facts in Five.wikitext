==Reception==
Ed Curtis reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "When the desire comes upon you for a change from arcade games, or from fighting against some historic army or mythological beast, CFIF should definitely be considered. Played solitaire or as a party game (where its abilities shine best), this game, with the vast number of options combinations available, will continue to be enjoyable for years to come."<ref name="CGW10">{{cite magazine |last=Curtis |first=Ed |title=Micro-Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=May–Jun 1983 |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=38–39}}</ref>
