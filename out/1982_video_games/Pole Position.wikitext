{{nihongo foot|'''''Pole Position'''''|ポールポジション|Pōru Pojishon|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[racing video game|racing]] [[arcade video game]] released by [[Namco]] in 1982. It was licensed to [[Atari, Inc.]] for US manufacture and distribution. ''Pole Position'' is considered one of the most important titles from the [[golden age of arcade video games]]. It was an evolution of Namco's earlier arcade racing [[electro-mechanical game]]s, notably ''[[F-1 (arcade game)|F-1]]'' (1976), whose designer Sho Osugi worked on ''Pole Position''.

The game was a major commercial success in arcades. After becoming the highest-grossing arcade game of 1982 in Japan, it went on to become the most popular coin-operated arcade video game internationally in 1983. In North America, it was the [[Arcade video game#Highest-grossing|highest-grossing arcade game]] for both 1983 and 1984 and still one of the top five in 1985.

''Pole Position'' spawned ports, sequels, and a [[Pole Position (TV series)|Saturday morning cartoon]], although the cartoon has little in common with the game. The game established the conventions of the racing game genre and its success inspired numerous [[Video game clone|imitators]]. ''Pole Position'' is regarded as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the most influential video games of all time]], and is considered to be the most influential racing game in particular. A sequel, ''[[Pole Position II]]'', was released in 1983 with four tracks instead of one.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Pole0000.png|thumbnail|left|The player's car approaching a curve]]

In this game, the player controls a [[Formula One]] [[race car]] and has to complete a [[time trial]] lap within a certain amount of time (between 57 and 120 seconds) to qualify for an F1 race at the [[Fuji Speedway|Fuji Racetrack]]. After qualifying, the player races against seven other CPU-controlled cars in a championship race (but if they do not qualify, the car will stay on the track until the timer runs out). The player must also avoid going off the road so that they will not crash into the billboards. Play continues until either time runs out in any lap and/or complete four laps of the race, which ends the game.

''Pole Position'' was the first racing video game to feature a track based on a real racing circuit. It was also the first game to feature a qualifying lap, requiring the player to complete a time trial before they can compete in [[Formula One|Grand Prix]] races. Once the player has qualified, they must complete the race in the time allowed, avoiding collisions with CPU-controlled opponents and billboards along the sides of the track. The game's North American distributor, Atari, publicized the game for its "unbelievable driving realism" in providing a [[Formula 1]] experience behind a [[racing wheel]]. The game's graphics featured full-colour landscapes with [[Sprite (computer graphics)#Move to 3D|scaling sprites]], including race cars and other signs, and a [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]], [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]], rear perspective view of the track, with its vanishing point swaying side to side as the player approaches corners, accurately simulating forward movement into the distance.<ref>Bernard Perron & Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), ''Video game theory reader two'', p. 157, [[Taylor & Francis]], {{ISBN|0-415-96282-X}}</ref> While earlier three-dimensional arcade driving games emphasized staying on the road while avoiding crashes, ''Pole Position'' gives a higher reward for passing rival cars and finishing among the leaders.<ref name="award"/>

==Cabinet==
''Pole Position'' was released in two configurations: a standard upright cabinet and an environmental/cockpit cabinet. Both versions feature a steering wheel and a gear shifter for low and high gears, but the environmental/cockpit cabinet featured both an accelerator and a brake pedal, while the standard upright one only featured an accelerator pedal.<ref name="KLOV">[http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9063 http://www.arcade-museum.com] - Pole Position - video game by Atari</ref>

==Development==
[[File:Pole Position in Computerspielemuseum, Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|A ''Pole Position'' arcade cabinet]]
''Pole Position'' was created by both Shinichiro Okamoto and ''[[Galaxian]]'' designer Kazunori Sawano.<ref name="Interview"/> Namco [[electro-mechanical game]] engineer Sho Osugi also assisted with development.<ref name="Interview"/> Based on Namco's experience with producing coin-operated electro-mechanical driving games in the 1970s, notably ''[[F-1 (arcade game)|F-1]]'' (1976) designed by Sho Osugi, Sawano showed Okamoto rough sketches of his idea, who liked the idea and began production of a video racing game. Okamoto wanted the game to be a true driving simulation game that used a 3D perspective and allowed the player to execute real-world techniques.<ref name="TV Game">{{cite book |author1=Video Game Museum Project |title=Terebi gēmu. |date=June 1988 |publisher=You B You |isbn=978-4946432316 |url=http://shmuplations.com/earlyarcade/ |language=ja}}</ref><ref name="Interview"/> He also chose to add the [[Fuji Speedway]] into the game to make newer players recognize it when they first played.<ref name="TV Game"/> Music was jointly composed by Nobuyuki Ohnogi and Yuriko Keino.<ref name="Szczepaniak">{{cite book |last1=Szczepaniak |first1=John |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |date=11 August 2014 |isbn=978-0992926007 |pages=201 |edition=First |url=https://archive.org/details/TheUntoldHistoryOfJapaneseGameDevelopersVol.2JohnSzczepaniak/page/n361?q=cutie+q |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>

Development of the game lasted for three years.<ref name="Interview"/> Okamoto recalls the most challenging part of development being to produce the hardware needed to run it, as the game was too "ambitious" to run on older hardware.<ref name="TV Game"/> The development team used two [[16-bit]] processors to power the game, which Okamoto says was an unheard-of concept for arcade games at the time<ref name="TV Game"/> — for a while, it was the only video game to use a [[Zilog Z8000|Z8000]] CPU.<ref name="Interview"/> ''[[Pac-Man]]'' creator [[Toru Iwatani]] chose the name ''Pole Position'' as he thought it sounded "cool" and appealing, and he shortly after filed a trademark for it.<ref name="Iwatani">{{cite web |title=バンダイナムコ知新「第1回 ビデオゲームのはじまり 後編」岩谷徹氏インタビュー |url=https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/asobimotto/page/videogame2.html |publisher=[[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] |access-date=13 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827174942/https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/asobimotto/page/videogame2.html |archive-date=27 August 2019 |date=6 March 2019}}</ref> The controls also proved to be a challenge, as Okamoto wanted them to feel realistic and to match up with the gameplay<ref name="TV Game"/> — Osugi remembers Namco president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] becoming frustrated with them, having difficulty keeping the car moving in a straight line.<ref name="Interview">{{cite web |title=バンダイナムコ知新「第2回 カーレースゲームの変遷 前編」大杉章氏、岡本進一郎氏、岡本達郎氏インタビュー |url=https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/asobimotto/page/carracinggames1.html |publisher=[[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] |access-date=13 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514132224/https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/asobimotto/page/carracinggames1.html |archive-date=14 May 2019 |date=25 April 2019}}</ref>

The game's arcade cabinet, a sit-down "environmental" machine, was chosen due to their popularity at the time.<ref name="Interview"/> The development team had long fights over how fast the gear-shift should be, until it was ultimately decided to simply be either high or low speed.<ref name="Interview"/>

==Release==
''Pole Position'' was officially released in Japan on September 16, 1982.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pole Position (Registration Number PA0000184751) |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov |website=[[United States Copyright Office]] |access-date=6 May 2021}}</ref><ref name="ATVGL:JaO1971-2005">{{cite book|last=Akagi|first=Masumi|url=https://archive.org/stream/ArcadeGameList1971-2005#page/n53/mode/1up|title=ナムコ Namco|work=アーケードTVゲームリスト 国内•海外編 (1971-2005)|edition=1st|publisher=Amusement News Agency|date=13 October 2006|page=52|isbn=978-4990251215|language=ja}}</ref> It was licensed out to [[Atari, Inc.]] for release in North America, where it made its debut at [[Chicago]]'s 1982 Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) show, held during November 18–20,<ref name="VideoGames">{{cite magazine | magazine = Video Games| volume = 1 | publisher = Pumpkin Press | issue = 6 | page = 66 | title = Top Ten Hits | date=March 1983 | url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_06_1983-03_Pumpkin_Press_US#page/n65/mode/2up}}</ref> before receiving a mass-market North American release on November 30, 1982,<ref>{{cite web |title=Pole Position (Registration Number PA0000184750) |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov |website=[[United States Copyright Office]] |access-date=6 May 2021}}</ref> while Namco themselves released the game in Europe in late 1982.<ref name="EU"/> After its release, Osugi stated that all of Namco's older electro-mechanical driving games were discontinued, as the company saw the future of arcade racers in the form of video games.<ref name="Interview"/>

==Advertising==
The game is an early example of [[product placement]] within a video game, with billboards around the track advertising actual companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qtchicks.hp.infoseek.co.jp/namco_pp.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220212702/http://qtchicks.hp.infoseek.co.jp/namco_pp.html|archive-date=2007-12-20 |script-title=ja:ポールポジション／II |language=ja |access-date=2009-07-03}}</ref>

===Reviews===
Upon its North American debut at AMOA 1982, it was reviewed by ''Video Games'' magazine, which listed it among the show's top ten games. They compared it favorably with Sega's ''[[Turbo (video game)|Turbo]]'' (1981), referring to ''Pole Position'' as "Turbo Deluxe" in "a speedway, not a cross-country race". They called ''Pole Position'' the "ultimate test of driving skill" for racing players.<ref name="VideoGames"/> ''[[Electronic Games]]'' reviewed the arcade game in 1983, writing that it "keeps the action on track from start to finish" with "challenging play", noting that the gameplay is "reasonably faithful to real life" Formula One races. They also praised the sound effects and "solid, realistic graphics", stating it has "very rich color images" and "dimensional depth to the graphics".<ref name="sharpe198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_16_1983-06_Reese_Communications_US/page/n91 | title=Insert Coin Here | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | author=Sharpe, Roger C. | pages=92–97}}</ref> They gave it the 1983 [[Electronic Games#Awards|Arcade Award]] for [[List of Game of the Year awards|Coin-Op Game of the Year]], praising the racing gameplay, "beautiful graphics" and "breathtaking" scenery as well as "the two-[[Tournament|heat]] format for the race itself".<ref name="award" />

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reviewed the arcade game in 1983, writing that it "is simply the most exhilarating [[Sim racing|driving simulation]] game on the market". They compared it favorably with ''[[Turbo (video game)|Turbo]]'', stating that, while ''Turbo'' "featured better landscapes", it "can't match the speed, thrills and skill behind this new race game". They said ''Pole Position''{{'}}s "graphics are sophisticated and believable", noting that cars "turning corners are shown in every graphic detail of the maneuvre", and praised the gameplay, concluding that "trying to hold a screaming curve or overtake" offers "thrills to compare with the real racetrack".<ref name="CVG18">{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 March 1983 |issue=18 (April 1983) |pages=30–1 |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-018/page/n29/mode/2up}}</ref> It was considered the all-time best racing/driving game by ''[[InfoWorld]]'' in 1983<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Industry |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |date=5 December 1983 |volume=5 |issue=49 |page=155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6C8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA155 |publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.}}</ref> and ''Computer Games'' in early 1985.<ref name="CG1985"/>

In 2007, ''[[Eurogamer]]'' gave it a mixed retrospective review, calling it "a simulation down to the core" and that those dedicated racing fans will be deterred by the game's difficulty.<ref name="EuroG"/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called ''Pole Position'' one of the top ten games for the [[Atari 2600]] in 2013.<ref name="ew">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/01/25/the-10-best-atari-games | first=Aaron | last=Morales | title=The 10 best Atari games | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=January 25, 2013 | access-date=April 17, 2016}}</ref>

===Impact===
''Pole Position'' is regarded as one of the most influential [[video game]]s of [[History of video games|all time]]. Bill Loguce and Matt Barton listed it as one of the 25 most influential games of all time, calling it "arguably the most important racing game ever made".<ref name="Loguidice">{{citation|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|first1=Bill|last1=Loguidice|first2=Matt|last2=Barton|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-240-81146-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_bFdsP9L7oC|pages=195–6|ref=vintage_log}}</ref> In 1984, ''Electronic Games'' stated that, for "the first time in the amusement parlors, a first-person racing game gives a higher reward for passing cars and finishing among the leaders rather than just for keeping all four wheels on the road, thus making driving an art".<ref name="award"/> In 1995, ''[[Flux (magazine)|Flux]]'' magazine ranked the game 32nd on their "Top 100 Video Games".<ref>{{Cite journal |date=April 1995 |title=Top 100 Video Games |url=https://archive.org/details/flux-issue-4/page/n29/mode/2up |journal=Flux |publisher=Harris Publications |issue=4 |pages=28}}</ref> In 2015, ''Pole Position'' topped [[IGN]]'s list of The Top 10 Most Influential Racing Games Ever. They stated that it had "a drastically better-looking" third-person "chase cam view" than ''Turbo'', was "the first racing game based on a real-world racing circuit ([[Fuji Speedway]] in Japan)", "introduced checkpoints, and was the first to require a qualifying lap", and that its success, as "the [[List of best-selling video games|highest-grossing]] arcade game in North America in 1983, cemented the genre in place for decades to come and inspired a horde of other racing games".<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2015/04/03/the-top-10-most-influential-racing-games-ever?page=2|title=The Top 10 Most Influential Racing Games Ever|date=3 April 2015}}</ref>
