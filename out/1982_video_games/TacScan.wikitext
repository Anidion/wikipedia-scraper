==Gameplay==

The game starts with seven individual ships in play. Those ships can be lost in any of the three stages by hitting a tunnel, getting shot, or colliding with an enemy, the [[laser]]-firing Ahmins composing the superfleet from the planet of Ahm. The player is able to "collect" and earn these ships back as the game progresses. The squadron can drop down to one ship in the game, but still have four "back-up" ships. If the final ship in play is lost, however, the game is over (even if the player has unused "back-up" ships). This is different from other games that give the player ships sequentially.

In the first [[level (computer and video games)|stage]], the player pilots their ships through [[wave]]s of attacking enemies. The player can either fire upon them, or "tac" their ships around them. The second stage is much like the first, except that it is from a 3-D third-person perspective from behind the player's ships. In the third stage, the player pilots their ships down a space warp tunnel, and will lose any ships that touch the side of the tunnel.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Tac/Scan'' on their July 1, 1983 issue as being the twenty-second most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=215|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 July 1983|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>
