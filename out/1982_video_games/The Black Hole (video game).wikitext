==Gameplay==
''The Black Hole'' is a game in which the player first flies a ship through a long tunnel avoiding projectiles, before coming to a wall protecting creatures, and in the third phase the player attacks the large mother ship.<ref name="CGW8"/>

==Reception==
Dick McGrath reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Black Hole'' is just an average arcade game but considering the variation provided by the three separate phases I would rate it a 6.5 out of 10."<ref name="CGW8">{{cite magazine |last=McGrath |first=Dick |title=Route 80: The Road to TRS-80 Gaming |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jan–Feb 1983 |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=38–39}}</ref>
