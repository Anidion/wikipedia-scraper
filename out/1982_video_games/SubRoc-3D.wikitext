'''''SubRoc-3D''''' (サブ・口ック3D ''SabuRokku-3D'') is a first-person [[Arcade video game|arcade]] [[shooter game]] released in 1982 by [[Sega]]. It is the first commercial video game in [[Stereoscopic video game|stereoscopic 3-D]], using a [[periscope]]-shaped display with a different image for each eye. It was jointly developed by Sega and [[Matsushita Electric]] (now Panasonic), who developed its [[active shutter 3D system]].<ref name="GM185"/><ref name="GM193"/> The game has stereo sound, and also changes the backdrop to reflect day, night, dawn, and dusk.<ref name="CVG Review"/>

The game was a commercial success for Sega in arcades. It was adapted for [[ColecoVision]], as '''''SubRoc''''', with simulated 3D effects, by Arnold Hendrick and Philip Taterczynski of the Coleco game design staff, with programming by David Wesely of 4D Interactive Systems.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Development and release==
The game's active-shutter 3-D technology was developed by [[Matsushita Electric]] (now Panasonic) for a [[3D television]] they had developed in the late 1970s and unveiled in 1981. The game began development around 1980, when Sega and Matsushita began discussing a "Stereo Viewer System" to adapt Matsushita's 3D television for video game use. Sega's director of technology for the project was Shikanosuke Ochi, who previously led the development of 1966 arcade [[electro-mechanical game]] ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]''. At the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) show in 1981, [[3D image]]s from the game were demonstrated on [[video tape]].<ref name="GM185"/>

Sega held a press conference on February 20, 1982 and demonstrated the first trial unit at the NOA Expo on March 1, 1982,<ref name="GM185"/><ref name="GM193">{{cite magazine|title=Overseas Readers Column: "Subroc-3D" Now Released - Sega/Esco Private Show Held|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=193|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=August 1, 1982|page=26|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19820401p.pdf}}</ref> the date when the game was first published.<ref name="Copyright">{{cite web |title=SubRoc-3D |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov |website=[[United States Copyright Office]] |access-date=13 May 2021}}</ref> Several game changes were made before it entered mass-production in Japan on July 2, 1982,<ref name="GM193"/> in North America in August 1982,<ref name="cashbox">{{cite magazine |title=Manufacturers Equipment |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=5 February 1983 |page=35 |url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox44unse_33/page/n34 |publisher=Cash Box Pub.
