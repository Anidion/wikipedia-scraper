'''''Worm War I''''' is an [[Atari 2600]] game written by [[David Lubar]] and published by [[20th Century Fox]] in 1982. It's a hybrid [[fixed shooter]] and vertically-scrolling game.

==Gameplay==
The game plays like a fixed shooter, with the player controlling a tank firing at giant [[Earthworm|worms]]. The tank auto scrolls up as the worms and blocks move down. Every time all the worms are wiped out, a new set spawns at the top of the screen. The pagoda can be shot to clear all the worms or rammed into by the tank to receive a fuel bonus. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} There are 99 waves with each wave starting with one worm with six at the end of the wave.
