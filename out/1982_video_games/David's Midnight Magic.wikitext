'''''David's Midnight Magic''''' is a [[pinball]] simulation video game written by David Snider for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Broderbund]] in 1982.<ref name="giantlist"/> The game was published in Europe by [[Ariolasoft]]. A port to [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was released the same year, then the [[Commodore 64]] in 1983. In 1987 [[Atari Corporation]] published a cartridge version in the styling of the then-new [[Atari XEGS]].

''David's Midnight Magic'' is closely modeled after the real-life pinball table ''[[Black Knight (pinball)|Black Knight]]'', released by [[WMS Industries|Williams]] in 1980.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' stated that ''David's Midnight Magic'' "ratifies [[Bill Budge]]'s extraordinary program as a programming tour de force", as it was only equal to Budge's ''[[Raster Blaster]]'' despite being released nine months later. The magazine concluded that "the fact that [''David'' is] second should not dull the glitter of this effort".<ref name="tommervik198201">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=6&id=3 | title=David's Midnight Magic | work=Softline | date=January 1982 | accessdate=13 July 2014 | author=Tommervik, Al | pages=32}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that ''Midnight Magic'' was a better game than ''Raster Blaster'', but lamented the requirement of removing [[write protection]] from the floppy, thus voiding the warranty, in order to save high scores.<ref>{{citation |last = Greenlaw | first = Stanley | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Pinball Mania | date = March–April 1982 |pages = 35, 38}}</ref> ''The Commodore 64 Home Companion'' called the game "extraordinarily realistic ... complete with all the features that make pinball so seductive".<ref name=C64HC>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/The_Commodore_64_Home_Companion#page/n167/mode/2up|title=Broderbund Software|work=The Commodore 64 Home Companion|year=1984|access-date=August 19, 2016|pages=166–167}}</ref>

''David's Midnight Magic'' won "Computer [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]]" at the 4th annual [[Arkie Awards]], where judges described it as "a program that is both an exciting video game and a fairly faithful evocation of pinball mystique".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= March 1983 |title= Arcade Alley: The Best Computer Games |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 12|pages= 32–33|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|32}}

==Legacy==
[[Atari Corporation]] released a pinball game called ''[[Midnight Magic (Atari 2600)|Midnight Magic]]'' for the Atari 2600 that plays differently from the similarly named ''David's Midnight Magic''.

[[Doug Carlston]] of Broderbund said in 1983 that Snider earned "somewhere in the six figures" in royalties from ''David's Midnight Magic''.<ref name="barry198310">{{Cite magazine |last=Barry |first=David |date=October 1983 |title=Profiles: The Carlston Trio |url=https://www.atarimagazines.com/v2n7/CarlstonTrio.html |magazine=Antic |access-date=2021-07-01}}</ref> Snider's brother Eric later used his first name in the title of ''[[Eric's Ultimate Solitaire]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In 2005, a ''[[Visual Pinball]]'' recreation of ''David's Midnight Magic'' was created called ''David's Midnight Magic 2005'' which is rendered with [[3D graphics]].
