'''''Anteater''''' ('''''The Anteater''''' in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], '''''Ameisenbär''''' in [[Germany]]) is an [[arcade video game]] designed by [[Chris Oberth]] and released in 1982 by Tago Electronics.<ref>[http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=anteater&page=detail&id=85 ''Anteater''] at Arcade History</ref> The player steers the tongue of the eponymous creature through a maze, retracting it when dangers approach. Though the arcade game was not a hit, it spawned a number of direct clones for home computers; Sierra's ''[[Oils Well]]'' became better known than the original. Oberth wrote an [[Apple II]] version of his own game for [[Datamost]] using a different title.

==Gameplay==
[[image:Anteater arcade.png|thumb|left|The anteater extending its tongue in a new level full of ant larvae (red dots).]]

The player controls an [[anteater]] that elongates its tongue through a maze-like [[ant colony]] in search of ants. Only the tip of the tongue can eat an ant. If an ant touches any other part of the tongue, then the player loses a life. Pressing the second button quickly retracts the anteater's tongue.

Worms can only be eaten from behind. Eating [[queen ant]]s at the very bottom of the nest temporarily removes all ants and worms from the screen. Once the sun has traveled across the screen and night falls, a spider appears. The spider climbs down the anteater's tongue, taking a life if it reaches the tip.

The object is to eat all of the larvae before time runs out, clearing the screen. Each larva is worth 10 points. Each ant is worth 100 points, while eating a worm is worth 200. Queen ants are worth 1,000. After losing a life or finishing a level, a bonus of 10 points for each ant eaten is multiplied by the number of worms eaten (for example, eating 5 ants and 2 worms = 50 x 2 = 100).

==Music==
Between levels, Anteater plays "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]".

At the start of each level, the music played is a short fragment of ''Ranz des Vaches'', the third movement of ''[[William Tell Overture]]''.

==Ports==
The game was ported to the [[Atari 2600]] by [[Mattel]] in 1983 but never published.<ref name="Atari Protos">[http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/anteater/anteater.htm ''Anteater''] at Atari Protos</ref> No official ports were released but [[Datamost]]'s ''Ardy The Aardvark'' (1983), which is almost identical, was written for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] by ''Anteater'' creator [[Chris Oberth]].<ref>[http://my.stratos.net/~hewston95/RTM24/RTM24.html#Oberth_Interview ''Interview with Programmer Christian Oberth - part 2: The classic programming years''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724085610/http://my.stratos.net/~hewston95/RTM24/RTM24.html#Oberth_Interview |date=July 24, 2011}}, Alan Hewston, Retrogaming Times, Issue 24, May 2006 (cited 29-Oct-11)</ref> That game was converted to the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Atari 8-bit computers]] by Jay Ford.

==Legacy==
[[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]]'s 1983 home clone, ''[[Oil's Well]]'', was re-themed to be about drilling for oil and was heavily promoted. It sparked its own clones: ''Pipeline Run'' for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1990<ref>{{lemon64 game|id=1937|name=Pipeline Run}}</ref> and ''Oilmania'' for the [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Other clones of ''Anteater'' are  [[Bug-Byte]]’s ''[[Aardvark (video game)|Aardvark]]'' (1986), ''Jack the Digger'' (1986) for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Jack the Digger|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-jack-the-digger_2632.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref> and [[Blue Ribbon (software house)|Blue Ribbon]]'s ''[[Diamond Mine (video game)|Diamond Mine]]'' (1984) and ''Diamond Mine II'' (1985).

The current arcade high score holder is [[Maria Blasucci]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.twingalaxies.com/showthread.php/172349-Arcade-Anteater-Points-224-170-Maria-Blasucci | title=Twin Galaxies Arcade - Anteater - Points - 224,170 - Maria Blasucci}}</ref>
