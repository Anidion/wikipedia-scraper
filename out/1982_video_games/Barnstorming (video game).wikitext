'''''Barnstorming''''' is an [[Atari 2600]] [[video game]] designed by [[Steve Cartwright]] and published by [[Activision]] in [[1982 in video gaming|1982]].{{sfn|Marriott}} It was the first game designed by Cartwright.  The idea for ''Barnstorming'' came to him as he watched a biplane one day while driving home from work.<ref>[http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=222 Classic Gaming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004135500/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=222 |date=October 4, 2008 }} at GameSpy</ref>

==Gameplay==

The player must pilot a [[biplane]] through a series of [[barn]]s in the shortest time possible while dodging [[windmill]]s, [[weather vane]]s, and [[goose|geese]]. Bumping into anything slows down the plane for a couple of seconds, increasing the overall time.

There are four levels of play determined by the game select switch. Game 1 is ''Hedge Hopper'' (10 barns), game 2 is ''Crop Duster'' (15 barns), game 3 is ''Stunt Pilot'' (15 barns), and game 4 is ''Flying Ace'' (25 barns). In the first three games, the course layout of barns, windmills, and even geese do not change, making it easy to memorize the layout. Game 4 is the only game with a random course.

Originally, a player with a time or better of 33.3 seconds on game 1, 51.0 seconds on game 2, or 54.0 seconds on game 3 could send Activision a picture of their screen and receive membership in the Activision Flying Aces<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-2600-vcs-barnstorming_11534.html | title=Atari 2600 VCS Barnstorming : Scans, dump, download, screenshots, ads, videos, catalog, instructions, roms | access-date=2024-03-02 | archive-date=2023-12-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231206044841/http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-2600-vcs-barnstorming_11534.html | url-status=live }}</ref> and a Flying Aces patch.

==Reception==
''Barnstorming'' was released in March 1982.{{sfn|Activision|1981|ref=catalog}} Richard A. Edwards reviewed ''Barnstorming'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'', commenting that "This is a game no Atari VCS owner should be without.  Buy it."{{sfn|Edwards|1982|p=28}}

From retrospective reviews, Scott Alan Marriott of [[AllGame]] noted the games impressive visuals but that the game got dull on repeated playthroughs as the game noting that "all of the levels are structured the same way [...] Once you complete your objective, you can either have another go at it or see how fast the cartridge flies under chairs."{{sfn|Marriott}}
