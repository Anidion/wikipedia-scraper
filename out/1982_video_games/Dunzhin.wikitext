'''''Warrior of Ras: Volume I - Dunzhin''''' is a [[fantasy]] [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Med Systems Software]]. It was released on the [[TRS-80]] in 1982, then ported to the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], and [[Commodore 64]]. A [[self-booting disk|self-booting]] [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] port added digitized speech.

==Gameplay==
''Dunzhin'' is a game in which the player explores a new, randomly generated dungeon each time the game is played. The fighter player character encounters monsters and human enemies, and the character earns experience points based on the disparity comparing their statistics with those of the monster. The player is in search of a well-guarded treasure located on the deepest level of the dungeon.<ref name="Dragon71"/>

==Development==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
The IBM PC port performs all disk access via IN/OUT instructions to the floppy controller instead of using the BIOS (this was done both to improve performance and as a copy protection). It also was not completely rewritten from the ground up, but instead contained the original [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] code from the TRS-80 with an interpreter to convert it to x86 assembly language.

==Reception==
''Dunzhin'' was reviewed in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine #71 by John Warren. The reviewer noted that while this game was able to accept more complex commands than other games of its time, the extra typing involved slowed the game down.<ref name="Dragon71">{{cite journal
