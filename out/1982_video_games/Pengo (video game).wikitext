{{nihongo|'''''Pengo'''''|ペンゴ}} is an [[arcade video game]] developed by [[Coreland]] and published by [[Sega]]. It was first released in [[Japan]] on September 26, 1982, in [[North America]] the following month, and in [[Europe]] that December. The player controls Pengo, a red [[penguin]] that resides in the [[Antarctic]]. The game takes place in an [[List of maze video games|overhead maze]] made of [[ice]] blocks, where Pengo crushes blob-like Sno-Bees by sliding blocks into them. The objective is to survive each round by eliminating all Sno-Bees and Sno-Bee eggs, while optionally lining up the three diamond blocks to earn a large score bonus.

There are two versions of the arcade game: the first uses "[[Popcorn (instrumental)|Popcorn]]" as the theme, and the second has original music. There are other small differences as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcadeshop.com/pengo_e-pack/pengo_e-pack.htm |title=Pengo High Score Save & Enhancement Pack |publisher=Arcadeshop.com |accessdate=2015-04-30 |archive-date=2015-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219145738/http://www.arcadeshop.com/pengo_e-pack/pengo_e-pack.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Pengo'' was ported to the [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], and [[Game Gear]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC Pengo (Act 2).png|thumb|left|The start of a round with Pengo in the center (arcade)]]

The player uses a four-position joystick and a single button to control Pengo, a penguin character. Pressing the button while pushing the joystick against an ice block will cause it to slide in that direction until it hits another block or a wall if the space ahead of it is empty. If that space is occupied, pressing the button will crush the block instead.

The goal is to destroy every Sno-Bee on the board by sliding ice blocks to crush them, crushing blocks that contain unhatched Sno-Bee eggs, or running over them after stunning them at a wall. Doing so in less than 60 seconds awards bonus points based on the time taken. 

At the start of each round, a certain number of eggs hatch into Sno-Bees, while other blocks flash to indicate that they contain eggs. As the player destroys active Sno-Bees, new ones hatch from the eggs to replace them. Crushing multiple Sno-Bees with one block awards extra points. The Sno-Bees can crush blocks in an attempt to reach Pengo. Pushing against a wall causes it to vibrate and temporarily stuns any Sno-Bees in contact with it; the player may then crush them with a block or simply run over them to destroy them. 

Three blocks in each round are marked with diamonds and cannot be crushed. Bonus points are awarded for forming a continuous vertical or horizontal line of these blocks: 10,000 if none of them are touching a wall, or 5,000 otherwise. Forming such a line also stuns every active Sno-Bee for a short time. 

If the player survives for two minutes without either losing a life or completing the round, all active Sno-Bees become Blobs. Their movement speed increases and they will move directly toward one of the walls, crushing all ice blocks in their path. Once a Blob reaches a wall, it will move toward a corner of the screen and disappear upon reaching it. Once all Blobs have either disappeared or been destroyed, the round ends. If the player destroys one of the last two Sno-Bees, the survivor will become a Blob after a 12-second delay. However, if the player destroys multiple Sno-Bees and leaves only one alive, it will become a Blob immediately.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zonadepruebas.com/viewtopic.php?f=115&t=5813 |title=Pengo. Sus últimos secretos |publisher=Zona de pruebas |date=2017-08-03 |accessdate=2017-08-03}}</ref>

The game includes a total of 16 rounds. After every second round, one of six [[cutscene|intermission]] animations is displayed. It then repeats indefinitely.

One life is lost whenever Pengo touches an un-stunned Sno-Bee or Blob. When all lives are lost, the game ends.

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' (''C&VG'') magazine gave it a highly positive review upon release, calling it "the cutest of coin-operated video games" and praising the "wonderful graphics, delightful characterisation, plenty of scope to work out your own" tactics, "catchy melody" and "that feeling of satisfaction you get when an ice-block picks up speed and knocks all the wind out of a surprised sno-bee!" Four members of the ''C&VG'' team gave a verdict that "is unanimous... ''Pengo'' is the C&VG tip for 1983."<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action: Pengo is Really Cool! |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 December 1982 |issue=15 (January 1983) |page=30 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/172/474}}</ref>
