A two-player mode allows two people to become either the Star Voyager or the enemy fleet.<ref name=db/> The commander of the Star Voyager has the ability to use [[missiles]] or a [[laser]] beam in order to stop the enemy.<ref name=db/> Star portals play a role in transporting the Star Voyager into another part of the galaxy.<ref name=db/> The game ends when the player dies or runs out of energy.<ref name=db/> The gameplay is loosely similar to that of the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] game ''[[Star Raiders]]'' (1979).
