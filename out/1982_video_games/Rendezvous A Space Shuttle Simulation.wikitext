==Reception==
Stanley Greenlaw reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Rendezvous'' is educational while being entertaining. Teachers will find it a valuable teaching tool in the areas of General Science, Earth Science, and Physics. As entertainment the simulation will appeal to gamers who enjoy mental challenges (such as those involved in setting up the orbital rendezvous) as well as to gamers who enjoy hand-eye co-ordination challenges (such as will be faced in the approach and docking segments). ''Rendezvous'' is a welcome addition to the educational and entertainment software field."<ref name="CGW5">{{cite magazine |last=Greenlaw |first=Stanley |title=Rendezvous: A Space Shuttle Simulator |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=July–August 1982 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=7}}</ref>
