{{nihongo foot|'''''Front Line'''''|フロントライン|Furonto Rain|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[military]]-themed [[run and gun video game]]  released by [[Taito]] for [[Arcade video game|arcades]] in November 1982.<ref name="Game Machine Magazine"/> It was one of the first overhead run and gun games, a precursor to many similarly-themed games of the mid-to-late 1980s. ''Front Line'' is controlled with a [[joystick]], a single button, and a [[rotary dial]] that can be pushed in like a button. The single button is used to throw grenades and to enter and exit tanks, while the rotary dial aims and fires the player's gun.

The game was created by Tetsuya Sasaki. It was a commercial success in Japan, where it was the seventh highest-grossing [[1982 in video games|arcade game of 1982]]. However, it received a mixed critical and commercial reception in Western markets, with praise for its originality but criticism for its difficulty. The game's overhead run and gun formula preceded [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'' (1985) by several years. The [[SNK]] shooters ''[[TNK III]]'' (1985) and ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' (1986) follow conventions established by ''Front Line'', including the vertically scrolling levels, entering/exiting tanks, and not dying when an occupied tank is destroyed.

==Gameplay==
Playing as a lone soldier, the player's ultimate objective is to lob a hand grenade into the enemy's fort, first by fighting off [[infantry]] units and then battling [[tank]]s before finally reaching the opponent's compound.

The player begins with two weapons: a pistol and grenades, with no ammo limit. Once the player has advanced far enough into enemy territory, there is a "tank warfare" stage in which the player can hijack a tank to fight off other enemy tanks.

There are two types of tanks available: a light tank armed with a machine gun and a heavy tank armed with a cannon. The light tank is more nimble, but can be easily destroyed by the enemy. The heavy tank is slower, but can sustain one hit from a light tank; a second hit from a light tank will destroy it. A single shot from a heavy tank will destroy either type of tank. If a partially damaged tank is evacuated, the player can jump back in and resume its normal operation; however, with either type of tank, the player must exit the vehicle within a few seconds of being struck by a fatal shot. If the player does not exit a tank before it explodes, they lose a life. An extra life is awarded at 10,000 or 15,000, and none thereafter.

The tank battle continues until the player reaches the enemy's fort. The fort is a brick-barricaded tank which fires mortar rounds while the player attempts to take it out. In order to destroy this tank, the player must toss a grenade over the brick barricade, which can only be accomplished on foot. Once this is done, the tank will explode and an enemy soldier will wave a white flag, signalling surrender, plus 1,000 bonus points. The game repeats again with the infantry level, but enemy soldiers become increasingly quicker and deadlier in successive rounds; points are multiplied based on the level played.

The arcade game was a commercial success in Japan, where ''Game Machine'' listed ''Front Line'' as the seventh highest-grossing [[1982 in video games|arcade video game of 1982]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title="Pole Position" No. 1 Video Game: ''Game Machine''{{'}}s "The Year's Best Three AM Machines" Survey Results|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=207|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 March 1983|page=30|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830301p.pdf#page=16}}</ref> ''Game Machine'' later listed ''Front Line'' on their June 1, 1983 issue as being the twentieth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=213|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 June 1983|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the arcade game had limited commercial success due to its initially high difficulty.<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |title=Behind Enemy Lines: Front Line |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 June 1983 |issue=33 (July 1983) |page=31 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/178/499}}</ref>

The arcade game received mixed reviews upon release, with praise for its originality but criticism for its difficulty. Following its North American debut at the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) show in November 1982, ''Video Games'' magazine published two reviews. One review said "Taito has a knack for coming up with some of the most original and offbeat games in the business" with ''Front Line'' being "an example" of this, while noting the controls are similar to Taito's earlier ''[[Western Gun]]'' (1975). The other review listed it among the top ten "Misses" of the show and stated it was a "war game with a lot of potential, but also with a firing mechanism that's so difficult to maneuver it ruins the game".<ref name="VideoGames">{{cite magazine | magazine = Video Games | volume = 1 | publisher = Pumpkin Press | issue = #7 | pages = 49, 66 | title = Front Line / Top Ten Hits | date=March 1983 | url=https://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_06_1983-03_Pumpkin_Press_US/page/n48}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' stated that, despite the initial difficulty, "the action really takes off" with the tank and it's "worth persevering with" until then.<ref name="CVG"/>

In the 1983 [[Electronic Games#Awards|Arcade Awards]], ''Front Line'' was a runner-up for [[List of Game of the Year awards|Coin-Op Game of the Year]], behind ''[[Pole Position (video game)|Pole Position]]''. The award was given by ''[[Electronic Games]]'', which stated that this "arcade approach to the dirty business of infantry combat forces the player to keep moving and firing constantly" and the "action is non-stop in this attractive [[shoot 'em up]]".<ref name="award">[https://archive.org/stream/electronic- games-magazine-1984-01/Electronic_Games_Issue_23_Vol_02_11_1984_Jan#page/n75/mode/1up]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Front Line''  was one of the first video games to feature a [[ground combat]] theme and grenades, a precursor to many similarly-themed games of the mid-to-late 1980s. It was one of the earliest overhead [[run and gun video game]]s, preceding [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'' (1985) by several years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Commando |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/commando/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=January 21, 2019 |access-date=31 August 2021}}</ref>

''Front Line'' was the basis for [[SNK]]'s ''[[TNK III]]'' (1985), known as ''T.A.N.K.'' in Japan and Europe. A programmer from SNK discovered ''Front Line'' at an arcade and thought that SNK could go further with the gameplay format. The team improved on ''Front Line'' with the addition of a rotary joystick. In turn, SNK went on to combine elements of ''T.A.N.K.'' with ''Commando'' (1985) to produce the arcade hit ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' (1986).<ref name="Continue">{{cite magazine |title=「怒」を作った男 |trans-title=The Man Who Made "Ikari" |magazine=[[:ja:CONTINUE (雑誌)|Continue]] |date=March 2001 |url=http://shmuplations.com/snkgoldenage/}}</ref> [[Jaleco]]'s ''[[Field Combat]]'' (1985) also has similar gameplay to ''Front Line''.<ref name="CG3">{{cite magazine |last1=Roberts |first1=Mike |title=Coin-Op Connection |magazine=[[Computer Gamer]] |date=June 1985 |issue=#3 |publisher=[[Argus Press]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=18–9 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_03_1985-06_Argus_Press_GB/page/n17/mode/2up}}</ref>

A [[Game Boy Color]] spin-off entitled ''[[Sgt. Rock|Sgt. Rock: On the Frontline]]'' was published by Taito in 2000. The game follows the template of the original arcade game, but is set within the [[DC Comics]] universe.

The arcade original was included in ''[[Taito Memories#Taito Memories Gekan|Taito Memories Gekan]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] console in 2005, and in ''[[Taito Legends 2]]'' for the PlayStation 2, [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platforms in 2006. The Famicom version was released for the [[Virtual Console]] service in Japan in June 2007 for the [[Wii]] and January 2014 for the [[Nintendo 3DS]].

The game was released for the [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]] via the [[Nintendo eShop]] in February 2019 by [[Hamster Corporation]] as part of their [[Arcade Archives]] series.<ref name="Aca">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/guide_every_arcade_archives_game_on_nintendo_switch_plus_our_top_picks|title=Guide: Every Arcade Archives Game On Nintendo Switch, Plus Our Top Picks|last=Lane|first=Gavin|date=2020-03-13|website=Nintendo Life|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> It was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] in January 2018 as part of the same series.<ref name="hamster">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/arcadearchives/title_list_aa.htm|title=Arcade Archives {{!}} HAMSTER Corporation |website=www.hamster.co.jp |access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>
