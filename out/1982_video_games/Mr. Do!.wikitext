{{nihongo foot|'''''Mr. Do!'''''|ミスタードゥ|Misutā Du|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1982 [[maze video game]] developed by [[Universal Entertainment|Universal]]. It is the first [[arcade video game]] to be released as a [[Arcade conversion|conversion kit]] for other cabinets; [[Taito]] published the conversion kit in Japan. The game was inspired by Namco's ''[[Dig Dug]]'' released earlier in 1982. ''Mr. Do!'' was a commercial success in Japan and North America, selling 30,000 arcade units in the US, and it was followed by several arcade sequels.

==Gameplay==
{{More citations needed|section|date=August 2021}}
The object of ''Mr. Do!'' is to score as many points as possible by digging tunnels through the ground and collecting cherries. The title character, Mr. Do (a circus clown—except for the original Japanese version of the game, in which he is a snowman), is constantly chased by red dinosaur-like monsters called creeps,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Mr. Do!: The Do Dude Returns |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |page=252}}</ref> and the player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by one. The game ends when the last life is lost.

[[Image:Mrdo.png|thumb|left|Mr. Do collecting cherries while avoiding creeps]]

Cherries are distributed throughout the level in groups of eight, and collecting all the cherries in one group without a pause awards bonus points. A level is complete either when all cherries are removed, all creeps are destroyed, "EXTRA" is spelled, or a diamond is found.

Mr. Do can defeat creeps by hitting them with his bouncing "power ball" or by dropping large apples on them. While the power ball is bouncing toward a creep, Mr. Do is defenseless. If the ball bounces into an area where there are no creeps to hit (such as behind a fallen apple), Mr. Do cannot use it again until he has retrieved it. When the power ball hits a creep, it then reforms in Mr. Do's hands after a delay that increases with each use.

Mr. Do or the creeps can push an apple off the edge of a vertical tunnel and crush one or more creeps. If an apple falls more than its own height, it breaks and disappears. Mr. Do can also be crushed by a falling apple, causing a loss of life.

Occasionally, the creeps transform briefly into more powerful multicolored monsters that can tunnel through the ground. If one of these digs through a cherry, it leaves fewer cherries for Mr. Do to collect. When it digs under an apple, it often crushes itself, other creeps, and/or Mr. Do.

As the game progresses, a display at the top of the screen cycles through the letters in the word EXTRA. Every time the player's score reaches a multiple of 5,000 points, the highlighted letter enters the playfield as an Alphamonster, which can be defeated in the same manner as a creep. Defeating the Alphamonster awards its letter; collecting all five letters ends the level, plays a cut scene accompanied by the theme to ''[[Astro Boy]]'', and awards the player an extra life. Alphamonsters attempt to eat any apples they encounter, which makes them difficult to crush.

The creeps spawn at the center of the screen. After they have all appeared, the generator will turn into a food item; picking this up scores bonus points, freezes all the creeps, and calls out an Alphamonster (if one is not already on the field) and three large blue monsters. The latter can eat apples as well. The creeps stay frozen until the player either defeats all three blue monsters, defeats the Alphamonster (in which case any remaining blue monsters are turned into apples), loses a life, or completes the stage.

Rarely, dropping an apple reveals a diamond which, if collected, completes the level and awards a bonus credit to the player.

The idea for the power ball came from Mr. Ueda observing a [[Super Ball]] stuck on the roof of a home near the Universal office in Japan.

==Ports==
''Mr. Do!'' was ported to the [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Apple II]], [[MSX]], [[Neo Geo]], [[Tomy Tutor]], and [[Commodore 64]]. A handheld [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] version was released by [[Tomy]] in 1983.

In the ColecoVision adaptation, the Alphamonster and sidekicks are unable to eat apples, making them easier to crush, but the blue monsters eat the shrubbery and cherries. Also, if an Alphamonster is over a letter that has already been acquired, the dinosaur monsters just freeze for a few seconds.

The Apple II and Atari 8-bit computer versions were released in May 1985.<ref name="CE1985">{{cite magazine |title=1985 Index |magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]] |date=January 1986 |volume=4 |issue=10 |page=6 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/newsletters/video_game_update/computer_entertainer_jan86.pdf#page=6}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Mr. Do!'' was followed by three sequels: ''[[Mr. Do's Castle]]'' in 1983, ''[[Mr. Do's Wild Ride]]'', and ''[[Do! Run Run]]'' both in 1984. An expanded 99-level version of ''Mr. Do!'' was released in arcades by Electrocoin in 1988.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Lacey|last=Eugene|title=Arcade Action: Mr Do|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=87 (January 1989)|date=16 December 1988|edition=1st|publisher=Terry Pratt|page=127|url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/32/232}}</ref>

A [[rebranded]] adaptation of the game was released for the [[Game Boy Color]] in 1999 as ''Quest: Fantasy Challenge'' (''Holy Magic Century'' in Europe). It was developed by [[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]].

The arcade version was released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on April 27, 2010.<ref>[http://vc.nintendolife.com/news/2010/03/japanese_virtual_console_list_april_2010 Virtual Console releases April 2010]</ref>

===Impact===
''Mr. Do!'' is credited as the first arcade game to be released as a [[Arcade conversion|conversion kit]].<ref name="Kent"/><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Cover Story: "This Is the Good Time" – Capcom's CPS system brings success to the firm... and offers direction for a troubled video market |magazine=RePlay |date=April 1990 |volume=15 |issue=7 |publisher=RePlay Publishing |pages=183–5 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-14-issue-no.-7-april-1990-600dpi/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2014%2C%20Issue%20No.%207%20-%20April%201990/page/183}}</ref> Multiple clones of ''Mr. Do!'' were released for home systems, including ''[[Magic Meanies]]'' (ZX Spectrum), ''Henri'' (Atari 8-bit),<ref>{{cite web |title=Henri |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-henri_2432.html |website=Atari Mania}}</ref> ''[[Fruity Frank]]'' (Amstrad CPC, MSX),  ''[[Mr. Dig]]'' (TRS-80 Color Computer, Atari 8-bit).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boyle |first1=L.

The game's creator Kazutoshi Ueda went on to work at [[Tehkan]] (now Tecmo) and then became a co-founder of [[Atlus]], where he worked on the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series. Ueda's work at Universal, particularly ''Mr. Do!'', inspired the game design style of Tehkan's Michitaka Tsuruta, who went on to create ''[[Guzzler]]'' (1983), ''[[Bomb Jack]]'' (1984), ''[[Solomon's Key]]'' (1986), and the ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'' game series.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Szczepaniak |first1=John |title=Michitaka Tsuruta - a history of Tecmo and classic platform-puzzlers |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnSzczepaniak/20150610/245663/Michitaka_Tsuruta__a_history_of_Tecmo_and_classic_platformpuzzlers.php |access-date=26 April 2021 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |date=June 10, 2015}}</ref>
