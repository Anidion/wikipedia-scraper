'''''Bump 'n' Jump''''' is an overhead-view [[vehicular combat game]] developed by [[Data East]] and originally released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Burnin' Rubber'''''|バーニンラバー|Bānin Rabā}}. Distributed in North America by [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]], the arcade version was available as both a dedicated board and as part of Data East's [[DECO Cassette System]]. The goal is to drive to the end of a course while knocking enemy vehicles into the sides of the track and jumping over large obstacles such as bodies of water.

The arcade game was a commercial success in Japan and North America. The game was ported to the [[Atari 2600]], [[Intellivision]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], and [[Sharp X1]]. The Famicom version of ''Burnin' Rubber'' was published as {{nihongo|'''''Buggy Popper'''''|バギー・ポッパー|Bagī Poppā}} in Japan in 1986.

==Gameplay==
The enemy vehicles are [[automobile|cars]] and [[truck]]s. Cars can be bumped into obstacles or jumped upon and destroyed, while trucks cannot be bumped; they can only be jumped upon to destroy them, and will sometimes drop obstacles that will destroy the player or one extra life. At the end of each level players receive bonus points for the number of enemy vehicles crashed. Going from one level to another is characterized by a change of seasons. Players get points for bumping other cars and causing the other cars to crash. 

When a large obstacle which needs to jumped over, such as a body of water, is approaching, then the game displays a flashing exclamation point as a warning.

Mattel Electronics licensed ''Bump 'n' Jump'' from Data East and in 1983 released an [[Intellivision]] version and then a version for the [[Atari 2600]]. They also produced a version for [[ColecoVision]] distributed by [[Coleco]] in 1984.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamefaqs.com/company/4308-mattel|title = Mattel Company Information - GameFAQs}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamefaqs.com/c64/566389-burnin-rubber|title = Burnin' Rubber for Commodore 64 - GameFAQs}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamefaqs.com/intellivision/576726-bump-n-jump|title=Bump 'n' Jump for Intellivision - GameFAQs}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamefaqs.com/colecovision/585462-bump-n-jump|title = Bump 'n' Jump for Colecovision - GameFAQs}}</ref>

Data East released a port of ''Burnin' Rubber'' as ''Buggy Popper'' for the Famicom in Japan in 1986. It was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America by [[Vic Tokai]] in December 1988 as ''Bump 'n' Jump''.<ref name="NintendoList">{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/nes_games.pdf |publisher=Nintendo of America |access-date=August 9, 2015 |title=NES Games |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611225644/http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/nes_games.pdf |archive-date=June 11, 2014 }}</ref><ref name="NES release">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587164-bump-n-jump/data|title = Bump 'n' Jump Release Information for NES - GameFAQs}}</ref> Adding a level of complexity, the NES version of the game also requires that players pick up cans of [[gasoline]] that are interspersed throughout each course, as their car uses up fuel steadily throughout the game if the car goes too fast.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Burnin' Rubber'' was the ninth highest-grossing [[1982 in video games|arcade game of 1982]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title="Pole Position" No. 1 Video Game: ''Game Machine''{{'}}s "The Year's Best Three AM Machines" Survey Results|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=207|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 March 1983|page=30|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19830301p.pdf#page=16}}</ref> In the United States, ''Bump 'n' Jump'' was among the thirteen highest-grossing [[1983 in video games|arcade games of 1983]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=AMOA Votes on Annual Game Awards |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=29 October 1983 |page=60 |url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox45unse_20/page/68}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' listed it as number 65 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time", lauding the innovative jumping and bumping mechanics, the variety of cars, and the strong sensation of speed and tension.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 100 Games of All Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21  |date=September 1996|page=48}}</ref>

The arcade version was made available on the [[PlayStation Portable]] in North America by G1M2 with its original title. The game also appears on the ''[[Data East Arcade Classics]]'' compilation with its original name.

Two clones were released for the Commodore 64. ''Burnin' Rubber'' in 1983 uses the chorale parts of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben]]'' cantata for the soundtrack. ''Bumping Buggies'' was produced in 1984.
