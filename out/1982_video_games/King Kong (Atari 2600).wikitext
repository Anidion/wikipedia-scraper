'''''King Kong''''' is a [[platform game]] programmed by Karl T. Olinger for the [[Atari 2600]] and published by [[Tigervision]] in 1982.<ref name="giantlist" /> Based on the licensed [[King Kong]] character,<ref name="manual" /> the game is a clone of the first screen of ''[[Donkey Kong]]''.<ref name="pg2cg" /> It was Tigervision's first cartridge release.<ref name="pg2cg" /> Tiger Electronic Toys produced a handheld version, licensed to [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]], the same year.<ref>{{cite web |title=King Kong Handheld |url=http://www.miniarcade.com/tandy/kingkonghh.htm |website=Mini Arcade}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
The objective is to rescue the girl by climbing ladders to the top of the screen while jumping over holes and autonomous bombs.<ref name="manual" /> Magic bombs are worth five times the points of regular bombs when jumped over. As in ''Donkey Kong'', each level has a bonus that counts down. If it reaches zero, a life is lost.

There are settings for 1 or 2 players alternating turns, slow or fast bombs, and whether magic bombs exist.<ref name="manual" />

== Reception ==
Ed Driscoll reviewed ''King Kong'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 58.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Driscoll |first=Ed |date=December 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=58|pages=48}}</ref> Driscoll commented that "overall, it's a fun-to-play game, with some good graphics. Not bad for a first cartridge!"<ref name="SG" />

''[[Electronic Games]]'' said that the game "presents a crude imitation of ''Donkey Kong'''s first scenario and replaces the barrels and flame creatures with what look like old-fashioned toilets, some of which have lit fuses".<ref name="pg2cg" /> In a 4 out of 10 review, ''Arcade Express'' considered ''King Kong'' "a poor rendition of the giant ape" and said that it was somewhat easier to play than other climbing games.<ref name="express">{{cite journal |title=The Hotseat: Reviews of New Products |journal=Arcade Express |date=October 24, 1982 |volume=1 |issue=6 |url=https://archive.org/details/arcade_express_v1n6/page/n5}}</ref>
