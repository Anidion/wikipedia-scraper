'''''Aztec''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by Paul Stephenson for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Datamost]] in 1982.<ref name="giantlist"/> It was  ported to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]]<ref name="mania"/> and  [[Commodore 64]]. In ''Aztec'', the player enters and explores the recently discovered "Tomb of [[Quetzalcoatl]]" in Mexico in search of a jade idol.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Aztec_Apple_II_screenshot.png|thumb|left|The player (bottom center) looking at their inventory, with three enemies roaming the area.]]

The tomb's levels contain traps, dangerous animals, [[Aztec]] guards, and other hazards. Equipped with a [[machete]], [[pistol]], and [[dynamite]], the player must to recover a [[jade]] [[cult image|idol]] and escape.

''Aztec'' generates a [[random dungeon]] for each new game.{{r|eg198306}} Before beginning play, the game prompts for a difficulty level from one to eight. Increasing the difficulty boosts the number and aggressiveness of the enemies and increases the reward for retrieving the idol. The shorter the time to obtain the idol, the higher the reward. Higher difficulty levels begin the countdown higher. If too much time elapses, the idol is reported as damaged.

The interior of the tomb is shown from the side with three floors and steps connecting the levels and floors. Piles of debris and chests can be searched, giving a pistol, ammunition, machete, dynamite, health potions, the remains of the Professor Von Forster, or the idol. Dynamite sticks serve as both a weapon or to blow up walls and floors. It's possible to break a staircase which is necessary to leave the tomb or to blow up the player's character.

More dangerous foes may capture the player or confiscate items and lead the player into a pit. Enemies can also cause the player to fall to the next level. Some rooms contain pits with traps. If the player dies, play resumes from the last level.

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' in 1983 called ''Aztec'' "no ordinary arcade or adventure game", stating that "the controls, game design, and animation are good examples of the state of the art in Apple arcades".<ref name="shore98301">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=6&id=9 | title=Aztec | work=Softline | date=January 1983 | accessdate=27 July 2014 | author=Shore, Howard A. | pages=45}}</ref>

''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine described the game as "a 'must buy' for Apple-ites", praising its variety, challenge, and its "straightforward system that uses single keystrokes" to communicate orders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= April 1983 |title= Arcade Alley: Zaxxon, Turbo, and Two for Apple II |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 1|pages= 26, 28–29|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|28,29}}

Tom Jones reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "When Aztec's few faults are balanced against some of the best action graphics and general designs now available, the latter definitely win hands down."<ref name="CGW10">{{cite magazine |last=Jones |first=Tom |title=Micro-Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=May–Jun 1983 |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=36, 38}}</ref>

''[[Electronic Games]]'' called the game's user interface "remarkably clean and logical", stating that because of the random dungeons "excitement remains keen through game after game".<ref name="eg198306">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/magazines/electronic_games/electronic_games_jun83.pdf| title=The Players Guide to Fantasy Games| work=Electronic Games|date=June 1983| accessdate=6 January 2015|page=56}}</ref>
