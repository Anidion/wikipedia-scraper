'''''Beany Bopper''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] for the [[Atari 2600]] from California-based developer [[Sirius Software]] and published by 20th Century Fox Games in 1982.<ref name="Weiss_2011">{{cite book |last1=Weiss |first1=Brett |title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984: A Complete Reference Guide |date=2011 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0786487554 |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&dq=%22Beany+Bopper%22&pg=PA36 |access-date=21 November 2023}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The player controls the "bopper", which is a ball that traverses a playing field with rectangular obstacles in it, and is tasked with preventing "beanies" (so called because they wear [[Beanie (seamed cap)#Propeller beanie|propeller beanie hats]]) from reaching the bottom of the screen. To do this the player must shoot the "beanies" with a stun-gun that can pivot through 360 degrees, and then touch them to capture them.<ref name="Videogaming Illustrated 1982">{{cite news |title=Eye On: a motion picture company gets Sirius |url=https://archive.org/details/videogaming-illustrated-december-1982/page/6/mode/2up?q=%22Beany+Bopper%22 |access-date=21 November 2023 |work=Videogaming Illustrated |publisher=ION International Inc. |date=December 1982 |page=7}}</ref> Two play-modes are possible: a first in which the "beanies" can not move through the obstructions, and a second in which they can. Objects fall from the top of the screen that can be collected by the player for additional points.<ref name="Weiss_2011" /><ref name="Hulse 1983">{{cite news |last1=Hulse |first1=Ed |title=Beany Bopper |url=https://archive.org/details/electronic-fun-with-computers-and-games-vol.-1-no-5-march-1983/Electronic%20Fun%20with%20Computers%20and%20Games%20-%20Vol.%201%20No.%205%20March%201983/page/n55/mode/2up?q=%22Beany+Bopper%22 |access-date=21 November 2023 |work=Electronic Fun With Computers and Games |issue=5 |date=March 1983 |pages=56–57}}</ref> Once sufficient "beanies" have been captured, "Bouncing Orange Eyes" start bouncing around the play-area that must be avoided.<ref name="Johnson 1983">{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Rick |date=July 1983 |title=Joysticks Are Go! |pages=14–15 |work=Vidiot |issue=4 |url=https://archive.org/details/vidiot-volume-1-number-4-june-july-1983/page/14/mode/2up?q=%22Beany+Bopper%22 |access-date=21 November 2023}}</ref>
