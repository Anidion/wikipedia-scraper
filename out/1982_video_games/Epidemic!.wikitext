'''''Epidemic!''''' is a turn-based strategy game in which the player stands in control of a world on the brink of extinction. It was developed by Steven Faber for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Strategic Simulations]] in 1982.<ref name=giantlist/> It was ported to [[Atari 8-bit computers]].

==Plot==
A meteorite crashes into Earth, bringing with it an alien virus. The player must stem the [[epidemic]] across 14 regions quickly as possible and with minimal loss of life.

==Gameplay==
The player has from 15 to 30 turns, with options ranging from inert methods like [[interferon]], to [[quarantine]], to destruction of a region with nuclear weapons.<ref name=manual/>

The game has four difficulty levels, ranging from small controllable scenarios of approximately 20 minutes at level 4, to full one-hour campaigns with severe difficulty at level 1.

==Reception==
Johnny L. Wilson reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "In conclusion, Epidemic is a good beginning level strategy game with excellent graphics. The game provides a real challenge to constantly better your score by curing the world as fast as you can."<ref name="CGW9">{{cite magazine |last=Wilson |first=Johnny L. |title=Epidemic: "An Apple (or PC) a day. . ." |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Marâ€“Apr 1983 |volume=1 |issue=9 |pages=39, 46}}</ref>

In a 1983 review for ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]]'', Brian J. Murphy wrote, "The game system is easy to master, and play is smooth," and "The documentation is entertainingly written and supports the program well, but even without the manual and player aid cards, a first time gamer stands a good chance of picking up the rules just by booting the disk and following the prompts."<ref name="murphy">{{cite journal |last1=Murphy |first1=Brian J. |title=Strategy Games and Simulations From SSI |journal=Creative Computing |date=September 1983 |volume=179 |url=https://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n9/179_Strategy_games_and_simula.php |access-date=2018-08-19 |archive-date=2018-05-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518200703/https://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n9/179_Strategy_games_and_simula.php |url-status=live }}</ref>
