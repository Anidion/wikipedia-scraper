''Utopia'' is a two-player game in which the two players each control one of the game's two islands. It lacks an [[AI]] opponent, although a single player can play to achieve a high score and ignore the other island. When starting the game, the players may choose how many rounds to play (up to 50) and the length of each round (30 to 120 seconds). The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.<ref name="GameManual">{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/instructions/strategy/utopia.txt
|title=UTOPIA Cartridge Instructions|publisher=Intellivision Productions, Inc.|access-date=2014-10-30}}</ref>

Each player rules their own island and uses the controller disc to move a rectangular [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] around the screen. Both players spend gold bars to construct different buildings (houses, schools, factories, hospitals and forts), plant crops, build [[fishing boat]]s or [[PT boat]]s, or to fund rebel activity on the enemy island. As each island's population grows, the ruler is responsible for housing their people, feeding their populace and keeping them happy, or else risk rebel activity, which decreases the player's score and sometimes destroys buildings. Income is generated when randomly generated rain clouds, (and sometimes [[hurricane]]s) pass over a player's farms, when a fishing boat is positioned over a school of fish, and at the end of each round, based on the player's factory output and fishing boats.<ref name="GameManual"/>

Most rounds consist of constructing a building, then continuously maneuvering the player's fishing boat over a moving school of fish in order to maintain fishing income, with occasional interruptions to construct new buildings whenever the player is able to afford them. Alternatively, a player might spend resources and time maneuvering a PT boat to try and sink their opponent's fishing boat in order to keep their income down. Game [[algorithm]]s generate and determine the course of rain clouds, tropical storms, hurricanes, schools of fish, and pirate ships.<ref name="GameManual"/>

[[GameSpy]] included ''Utopia'' in its Hall of Fame in 2004, commenting: "Considering the state of home video-game technology in 1981, ''Utopia'' is an astonishingly detailed simulation."<ref name="gamespy">[http://www.gamespy.com/articles/495/495918p1.html GameSpy Hall of Fame Article on ''Utopia'']</ref> [[GameSpot]] featured ''Utopia'' in its series Unsung Heroes: Ground Breaking Games, calling it a "surprisingly complex game (often referred to as '[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]] 0.5') [that] laid the foundation for PC sim classics such as ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' and ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]''."<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/pc/unsung_heroes/sec2_01.html |title=Unsung Heroes: Ground Breaking Games – Utopia |last=Baker |first=T.

[[Ars Technica]] cites ''Utopia'' as being the "birth of a genre", that "prior to the mid-1990s strategy games were turn based", the "idea of adding a real-time element to force players into instant, impulsive decisions were virtually unheard of."  Ars Technica states that it is "arguably the earliest ancestor of the real-time strategy genre".<ref name="arstechnica2">{{cite web | last = Moss | first = Richard | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/build-gather-brawl-repeat-the-history-of-real-time-strategy-games/ | title=Build, gather, brawl, repeat: The history of real-time strategy games | date = September 15, 2017 | access-date=October 20, 2017 }}</ref> Matt Barton and Bill Loguidice say it "helped set the template for the real-time strategy genre",<ref name="Loguidice">{{cite book|last1=Loguidice|first1=Bill|last2=Barton|first2=Matt|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|date=2009|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|location=Boston|page=238|isbn=978-0240811468}}</ref> but has "more in common with ''[[SimCity]]'' than it does with ''Dune II'' and later RTS games."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Loguidice|first1=Bill|last2=Barton|first2=Matt|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781136137587|page=73}}</ref> Brett Weiss argues that "[m]ost experts consider ''Utopia''" to be "the first real-time strategy game."<ref name = "Weiss">{{cite book | first = Brett | last = Weiss | title = Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide | date=2011 | page = 291 | publisher = [[McFarland & Co.]] | isbn=9780786487554 }}</ref>
