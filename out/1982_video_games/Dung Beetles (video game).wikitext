'''''Dung Beetles''''' is an [[Apple II]] [[maze game]] written by Bob Bishop published in 1982 by [[Datasoft]].<ref name="giantlist"/> The gameplay is similar to ''[[Pac-Man]]'', but a portion of the maze around the player-controlled character is enlarged as if being viewed through a square [[magnifying glass]].

''Dung Beetles'' was ported to [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]]. The Color Computer version, programmed by Steve Bjork, was sold by [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]] as '''''Mega-Bug'''''.<ref name=boyle>{{cite web|last1=Boyle|first1=L. Curtis|title=Mega-Bug|url=http://www.lcurtisboyle.com/nitros9/megabug.html|website=Tandy Color Computer Games}}</ref> Later Apple II and Atari versions were renamed to '''''Tumble Bugs'''''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tumble Bugs|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-tumble-bugs_5548.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref> In 1983, Datasoft moved the game to its Gentry Software label with another name change: '''''Magneto Bugs'''''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=New Products |journal=ANALOG Computing |date=September 1983 |issue=13 |page=17 |url=https://archive.org/details/analog-computing-magazine-13/page/n17/mode/2up}}</ref> In [[Australia]], the game was sold as '''''Bug Attack'''''.{{cn|date=March 2018}} It was also released for the [[PC-6000 series]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Dung_Beetles_Atari_8-bit_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Here the magnified part of the maze overlaps the score (Atari 8-bit).]]

The game concept and gameplay are based on ''[[Pac-Man]]'', but features a much larger, randomly-generated maze and a moving "magnifying rectangle" that shows the player's character, maze details, and nearby enemies close-up. The objective of the game is to score points by eating all of the dots in the maze. As the player character moves through the maze, it leaves a trail of [[manure|dung]] behind. [[Dung beetle]]s navigate the maze searching for the player. When a beetle finds a trail of dung, it will start following that trail, consuming it as it goes. It picks a direction at random when the trail splits, and goes back to searching if the trail ends.

The game ends when the player's character is caught by a dung beetle, at which point the game plays a [[speech synthesis|digitized voice]] that says "We gotcha!" and gives a brief animation.

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' found the magnifying glass "an impressive programming feat," and concluded that it was "a solid game ... It could stand some more variety, but it certainly does not lack challenge".<ref name="durkee198205">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=6&id=5 | title=Tumblebugs | work=Softline | date=May 1982 | accessdate=15 July 2014 | author=Durkee, David | pages=16â€“17}}</ref> Writing for ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'', Marc Benioff called ''Tumble Bugs'', "an outstanding variation on ''Pac-Man''".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Benioff |first1=Marc |title=Benioff At Large |journal=ANALOG Computing |date=May 1982 |issue=6 |page=7 |url=https://archive.org/details/analog-computing-magazine-06/page/n9/mode/2up}}</ref>
