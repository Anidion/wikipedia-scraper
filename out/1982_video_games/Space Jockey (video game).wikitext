'''''Space Jockey''''' is a [[scrolling shooter]] designed by [[Garry Kitchen]] for the Atari VCS (renamed to the [[Atari 2600]] later in the year). It was published under the Vidtec brand of [[U.S. Games]] in 1982 as the initial release from the company.{{sfn|Bloom|1982|p=16}}  The game shipped on a 2K cartridge at a time when most VCS games were 4K.{{sfn|Retro Gamer|2014|ref=RetroGamer}}

''Space Jockey'' was the first video game designed by [[Garry Kitchen]]. He went on to program the 2600 port of ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''.{{sfn|Hickey, Jr.|2020|p=25}}

==Gameplay==
[[File:Space-jockey-game-capture.gif|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Space Jockey''.]]
The player controls an "attack saucer" that flies to the right over scrolling, undulating terrain. The saucer only moves vertically and stops just before it hits the ground. The goal is to shoot ground-based tanks and flying enemies: jet planes, propeller planes, helicopters, and [[hot air balloon]]s.{{sfn|U.S. Games Coproration|1982|ref=manual}}Trees and houses appear on the ground as obstacles which can also be destroyed.

==Development==
''Space Jockey'' was a was developed by [[Gary Kitchen]] and was his first game he made for the [[Atari 2600]]. The game was a result of a six-month effort to [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] the Atari 2600 while working at James Wickstead Design Associates (WDA).{{sfn|Hickey, Jr.|2020|p=25}}

Kitchen later described ''Space Jockey'' as "just a modestly fun game" and was predominantly a test bed for him during the process of reverse engineering the Atari VCS.{{sfn|Fisher|2013|p=92}}

''Space Jockey'' was released in January 1982.{{sfn|Bloom|1982|p=16}} According to a 2013 interview with Kitchen, ''Space Jockey'' sold over a million copies, but he believes most of those were at a discount.{{sfn|Fisher|2013|p=92}} A February 1983 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' article on retailers lowering game prices mentioned, "US Games recently sold off one of its older hits, the 2K ''Space Jockey'', at rock bottom prices through its distributors."{{sfn|Sweeting|1983|p=3}}{{sfn|Sweeting|1983|p=60}}

Dan Gutman reviewed ''Space Jockey'' in the December 1982 issue of ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]''. Gutman compared the game to ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]'' (1981) and ''[[Chopper Command]]'' (1982) saying that "there is nothing meaty here [...] but that doesn't mean it's bad" and that the game was "a pure test of your reaction time and doesn't pretend to be anything more."{{sfn|Gutman|1982|pp=62-63}} ''Space Jockey'' was one of three runners-up for the "Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Videogame" category in the 1983 Arcade Awards.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 1983 Arcade Awards |journal=Arcade Express |date=November 7, 1982 |volume=1 |issue=7 |url=https://archive.org/details/arcade_express_v1n7/page/n3}}</ref>

From retrospective reviews, Brett Alan Weiss of online game database [[RhythmOne#AllGame|AllGame]] declared the game to be "a simplistic but enjoyable shooter."{{sfn|Weiss}}
