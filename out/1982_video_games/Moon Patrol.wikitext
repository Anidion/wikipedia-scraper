{{nihongo|'''''Moon Patrol'''''|ムーンパトロール|Mūn Patorōru}} is a 1982 [[arcade video game]] developed and released by [[Irem]]. It was licensed to [[WMS Industries|Williams]] for distribution in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8747 |title=Moon Patrol - Videogame by Irem |publisher=Arcade-museum.com |access-date=2015-02-19}}</ref> The player controls a Moon buggy which can jump over and shoot obstacles on a horizontally [[scrolling]] landscape as well as shoot aerial attackers. Designed by [[Takashi Nishiyama]], ''Moon Patrol'' is often credited with the introduction of full [[parallax scrolling]] in [[side-scrolling game]]s. Cabinet art for the Williams version was done by Larry Day. Most of the home ports were from [[Atari, Inc.]], sometimes under the [[Atarisoft]] label.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Moon patrol.png|thumb|left|Two UFOs attack the moon buggy from above.]]

As a Luna City [[police officer]] assigned to Sector Nine, the home of the "toughest thugs in the galaxy", the player controls a [[Lunar Roving Vehicle|Moon buggy]] that travels to the right over the horizontally scrolling surface of the [[Moon]]. Craters, mines, and other obstacles on the ground must be shot or jumped over. Three types of flying [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s attack from above and must be shot down. One of the flying enemies has a weapon which creates a crater when it hits the ground.

Gameplay takes place on two courses, each divided into 26 checkpoints identified with letters of the [[English alphabet]]. Of these, the five major checkpoints—''E'', ''J'', ''O'', ''T'' and, ''Z''—denote a new "stage" with a new background and theme; for example, the third stage starts at J and introduces mines. The top portion of the screen shows a timeline-style map of the course, with the major checkpoints marked. Above the map is an indicator of the current checkpoint, the time spent in the stage, and three indicator lights: the top light indicates upcoming enemy aerial attacks, the middle one indicates an upcoming minefield, and the bottom one indicates enemies approaching from behind.

At the end of a stage, that time spent is compared to the average, and bonus points are awarded accordingly, at 1,000 plus 100 per second bettered; completing an entire course gives an additional 5,000 points plus 100 per second bettered. There are two unique courses: the "Beginner Course" and the "Champion Course". The Champion Course "loops" forever, and each loop is numbered for convenience, up to three.

Extra lives are given at 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000 points; thereafter, no more lives are given. The game ends when the last patrol car is destroyed. The game can be continued, but points scored from one game do not carry over. 999,990 points is the maximum high score that can be achieved; players can exceed this score, but it "turns over" if they do.

==Legacy==
''Moon Patrol'' was included in the retro compilations ''Arcade Hits: Moon Patrol & Spy Hunter'' for [[Game Boy Color]] and ''Midway Presents [[Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Midway Collection 2]]'' for [[Dreamcast]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. In 2006 [[Bandai]] released an enhanced version as ''Moon Patrol EX'' for cell phones.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Levi|title=Moon Patrol EX|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/06/29/moon-patrol-ex|website=IGN|date=June 29, 2006}}</ref> ''Lunar Patrol [[J2ME]]'' was released in 2012 by [https://grpsoft.itch.io ''GRP Software''] ([[Java ME]] and [[Symbian]]) with enhanced physics and playability. ''Moon Patrol'' was released for the [[Nintendo Switch]] by [[Hamster Corporation|Hamster]] in March 2018 as part of the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/arcadearchives/switch/moon_patrol.htm|title=ArcadeArchives &#124; Nintendo Switch|website=Hamster.co.jp|access-date=23 March 2022}}</ref> 

===Clones===
A bootleg version called ''Moon Ranger'' was released in the arcades the same year as ''Moon Patrol''.<ref name="moonranger">{{cite web|url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8750 |title=Moon Ranger - Videogame by Unknown |publisher=Klov.com |access-date=2015-02-19}}</ref>

Home clones include  ''Desert Patrol'' for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] (1983), 
''Gas Hog'' for the [[Atari 2600]] (1983),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trionfo|first1=Adam|last2= Federico|first2=Chris|title=Gas Hog|url=http://www.orphanedgames.com/articles/Gas_Hog/Gas_Hog.html|website=Orphaned Computers & Game Systems}}</ref> ''Lunar Rover Patrol'' for the [[Dragon 32]] (1983), ''Moon Buggy'' for the [[Commodore 64]] (1983), ''Moon Alert'' for the [[ZX Spectrum]] (1984), ''Luna Rover'' for the [[ZX Spectrum]] (1985),<ref>{{cite web|title=Luna Rover|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002954|website=World of Spectrum}}</ref> ''Moon Control'' for the [[Amstrad CPC]] (1985), ''Moonrider'' for [[MSX]] (1986), and ''Overlander'' for the [[Amiga]] (1993). ''[[Battle Through Time]]'' (1984) for the Commodore 64 re-themed the gameplay to be about major wars of the 20th century. A contemporaneous review for ''[[B.C.'s Quest for Tires]]'' (1983) remarked on the game's similarity to ''Moon Patrol''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harvey |title=8-Bit Product Reviews |journal=Antic |date=March 1984 |volume=2 |issue=12 |url=https://www.atarimagazines.com/v2n12/productreviews.html}}</ref>

Open-source clones named ''moon-buggy''<ref>{{cite web|title=moon-buggy|url=https://ttygames.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/moon-buggy/|website=Games on the Linux console|date=14 April 2013}}</ref> and ''[[ASCII]] Patrol''<ref>{{cite web|title=Ascii Patrol|url=http://ascii-patrol.com/|website=Homepage}}</ref> run in Unix-like terminals.

===Impact===
''Moon Patrol'' introduced full [[parallax scrolling]]. The arcade video game ''[[Jump Bug]]'' (1981) had previously used a limited form of parallax scrolling, with the main scene scrolling while the starry night sky is fixed and clouds move slowly. ''Moon Patrol'' has three separate background layers scrolling at different speeds, simulating the distance between them.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uduslivii |first1=Igor |title=iPhone Game Blueprints |date=26 December 2013 |publisher=[[Packt Publishing Ltd]] |isbn=978-1-84969-027-0 |page=339 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5R4AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT339}}</ref> [[Taito]]'s ''[[Jungle Hunt|Jungle King]]'', also with parallax scrolling, was released a month after ''Moon Patrol''.

The game's designer [[Takashi Nishiyama]] went on to create the [[beat 'em up]] game ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' (1984).
