'''''Kozmik Krooz'r''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]] developed by [[Bally Midway]] and released in arcades in 1982. The spaceship, a core element of the gameplay, is not an in-game graphic, but a physical plastic model.  A series of mirrors projects the mothership just above the game's monitor.

==Gameplay==
Players guide Kapt. Krooz'r to a rotating [[mothership]] at the top of the playfield, one which can only be entered when its [[tractor beam]] is operational. Players can also shoot enemies in one of eight directions and deflect firepower during their journey. Every fifth round there is a bonus round where Kapt. Krooz'r must pick up space junk.

==Development==
The game was originally known as ''Kapt. Krooz'r''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyerdb&subpage=thumbs&id=3806|title = The Arcade Flyer Archive - Video Game Flyers: Kapt'n Krooz'r, Bally-Midway}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The character ''Kapt. Krooz'r'' is also in the 1983 arcade game ''[[Wacko]]''.

''Kozmik Krooz'r'' is included in the 2004 release of ''[[Midway Arcade Treasures 2]]''. The mothership is represented by 3D polygons.
