'''''Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle''''' is a 1982 [[video game]] published and developed by [[Coleco]] for the [[ColecoVision]] and [[Atari 2600]]. The game is based on the television series ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]''. In the game, the player must brave a series of obstacles to rescue [[Smurfette]] from [[Gargamel]]'s castle.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Smurf.gif|thumb|Even stumbling over a few weeds can be fatal.]]
Gargamel has kidnapped Smurfette.  As a Smurf, the player has to walk from the Smurf village through a forest and a cave on the way to Gargamel's castle, where Smurfette awaits rescue. The player has an energy bar that slowly depletes over time.

Each side-scrolling screen presents various obstacles that the player must precisely jump over (e.g. fences, [[stalagmite]]s) or land upon (e.g. ledges). Failure to execute any jump results in instant death. Higher difficulty levels introduce crows, flying bats and spiders that the player must also avoid.

The ColecoVision version of ''Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle'' contains [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] - initials may appear onscreen when moving between screens, and the player will receive hundreds of thousands of points, when moving between two forest screens.<ref name="eg198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n109/mode/2up | title=Q&A | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=7 January 2015 | author=The Game Doctor | pages=112 | author-link=The Game Doctor}}</ref>

Two of the background music tracks are "[[Simple Gifts]]" and the first movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s 6th Symphony, the "Pastoral".

== Reception ==
''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]] Video & Arcade Games'' said in 1983 that ''Smurf'' for ColecoVision was "truly good fun", approving of its graphics. The magazine stated that the game was suitable for very young children and older ones, reporting that neighborhood kids "loved it. I almost had to evict them from my house at night so I could get a game in before going to sleep".<ref name=linzmayer1983spring>{{Cite magazine |last=Linzmayer |first=Owen |date=Spring 1983 |title=Home Video Games: Colecovision: Alive With Five |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/colecovision.php |magazine=Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games |page=50}}</ref> The ColecoVision version was reviewed in ''Video'' magazine in its "Arcade Alley" column where it was praised as utilizing "the best audiovisuals in the entire [ColecoVision] line". The visuals were described as "what amounts to the video-game equivalent of a [[Saturday-morning cartoon]] show", and the audio was described as "sophisticated" with nuanced sounds such as ominous organ music and the "muted echo" accompaniment to standard leaps. The reviewers also cautioned players to "prepare for frustration" until they learned how to accurately judge leaps.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= January 1983 |title= Arcade Alley: Smurf & Ladybug from ColecoVision |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 10|pages= 50, 122|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>
