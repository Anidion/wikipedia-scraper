{{nihongo|'''''Kangaroo'''''|カンガルー|lead=yes}} is a four-screen [[platform game]] released as an [[arcade video game]] 1982 by [[Sunsoft|Sun Electronics]] and distributed in North America by [[Atari, Inc.]]<ref name="GM188">{{cite magazine|title=Overseas Readers Column: Sun, Atari Game Pact On "Kangaroo" Video - For W.Germany Sun Licensed Löwen|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=188|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 May 1982|page=26|lang=ja}}</ref> ''Kangaroo'' is one of the first arcade games similar in style to ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' without being a direct clone. The player takes the role of a boxing glove-wearing mother [[kangaroo]] who is trying to rescue her joey from fruit-throwing monkeys. Jumping is integral to the game, but there is no jump button. Instead, the player pushes up on the joystick&mdash;or up and diagonally&mdash;to leap. The arcade version of ''Kangaroo'' has visible glitches in the graphics, such as sprites briefly flickering.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brundage|first1=Darren|title=Kangaroo|url=http://www.ataritimes.com/index.php?ArticleIDX=582|website=The Atari Times|ref=ataritimes|date=June 27, 2007}}</ref>

Atari published ports for the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 5200]]. The 5200 version was ported to [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and sold through the [[Atari Program Exchange]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Kangaroo screenshot.png|thumb|left|upright|The mother kangaroo at the bottom of the first level, and her blindfolded joey at the top.]]

There are four different [[level (video games)|levels]]. Three of them consist of the mother [[kangaroo]] on the bottom floor trying to reach the top floor where her [[joey (marsupial)|joey]] is being held captive by some [[monkey]]s. On each of the levels monkeys throw [[apple]]s and apple cores, which the mother kangaroo must either jump, duck, or punch. If she gets face to face with one of the monkeys, she can punch it with a [[boxing glove]]. There are also pieces of fruit that she can jump up and get for points; if she jumps and touches a bell, higher-value fruits will appear to replace the ones she has already collected. She must be wary of the big [[Ape]], who will occasionally appear and try to take her gloves away from her. The level must be completed before the time runs out; otherwise, the player will lose a life.

Levels 1, 2 and 4 consist of different platforms that the mother kangaroo must jump onto or climb onto via a ladder. On the third level, the joey is in a cage held up by a troop of monkeys, and there is a horde of apples that will be unleashed if five monkeys climb up to it. On this level, the mother kangaroo must punch each monkey in the stack several times until the cage is lowered and, when the cage has been lowered enough, the mother kangaroo must climb to the next floor to get to the joey before the cage is raised again.

The game uses classical and folk songs, including "[[Turkish March (Beethoven)|Turkish March]]" by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (at game start), "[[American Patrol]]" by [[F. W. Meacham]] (during regular gameplay), "[[Oh! Susanna]]" by [[Stephen Foster]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8275 |title=Kangaroo - Videogame by Sun Electronics |publisher=Arcade-museum.com |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref> (level completion fanfare), and "[[Westminster Quarters]]" (when a bell is rung).

==Ports==
[[Image:Kangaroo_Atari_8-bit_screenshot.png|thumb|right|Level 2 of the Atari 8-bit version]]
[[Atari, Inc.]] published ports of ''Kangaroo'' for the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 5200]] in 1983.

Jim Leiterman of Atari Research ported the Atari 5200 cartridge to the technically similar [[Atari 8-bit computers]] in one day. He used a tool he had written to disassemble the game code, then modified the source and assembled an Atari 8-bit version.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leiterman |first1=Jim |title=Atari Research |url=http://leiterman.com/atari.html}}</ref> Leiterman submitted it to the [[Atari Program Exchange]] and requested they publish it without attribution. This was unusual, as APX was created to publish user-written software, not licensed ports or software developed internally at Atari.

==Reception==
''Arcade Express'' gave the arcade version an 8 out of 10 in November 1982.

The Atari 5200 version of ''Kangaroo'' was reviewed by ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine in its "Arcade Alley" column where it received mixed commentary. While describing the game as "an excellent piece of work", reviewers also admitted that it had "fail[ed] to bowl [them] over" and criticized the game's "animation-quality graphics" which appeared to be used primarily to "dress up rudimentary play-action".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= November 1983 |title= Arcade Alley: Wintertime Winners |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 8|pages= 38–39|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|39}} It was later awarded "1984 Best Arcade-to-Home Video Game/Computer Game Translation" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]], where judges noted that "all aspects of the game look and play" as a "virtual duplicate" of the arcade version.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= February 1984 |title= Arcade Alley: The 1984 Arcade Awards, Part II |journal= Video |publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 11|pages= 28–29|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|29}}

Charles Ardai, reviewing the Atari 2600 version for ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'', wrote that despite having "horrible" graphics and sound, the gameplay of  ''Kangaroo'' is better than in the arcades.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ardai |first1=Charles |title=Kangaroo |journal=Electronic Fun with Computers & Games |date=October 1983 |volume=1 |issue=12 |page=[https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_12_1983-10_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/page/n57 58] |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_12_1983-10_Fun_Games_Publishing_US}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1984, ''Kangaroo'' and ''[[Space Ace]]'' replaced ''[[Pitfall!|Pitfall Harry]]'', ''[[Frogger]]'', and ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'' in [[CBS]]'s ''[[Saturday Supercade]]''. The cartoon revolves around kangaroos Katy (voiced by Mea Martineau) and Joey (voiced by [[David Mendenhall]]) who live in a zoo run by the [[zookeeper]] Mr. Friendly (voiced by [[Arthur Burghardt]]). The series has never been officially released on DVD or VHS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085008/|title=Saturday Supercade (TV Series 1983–1985)|author=comicwatch|date=November 12, 2005|work=IMDb|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>

The original arcade version was made available on July 16, 2020 as part of [[Hamster Corporation]]'s ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' series. It was released digitally on [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Doolan |first1=Liam |title=Kangaroo Hops Onto Hamster's Arcade Archives Collection This Week |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/kangaroo_hops_onto_hamsters_arcade_archives_collection_this_week |website=Nintendo Life |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=July 16, 2020 |date=July 16, 2020}}</ref>
