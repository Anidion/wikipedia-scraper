'''''Supreme Ruler''''' is a [[Computer game|computer]] [[Strategy video game|strategy game]] in which a player controls a region's [[government]] and attempts to conquer a fictional world of fragmented [[Nation state|states]].  The game simulates raising funds through taxes and spending on agriculture, government services, and the military.  Up to 9 regions play at once, either human [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]] or AI controlled, and all actions are resolved simultaneously at the end of each turn.  The design of Supreme Ruler was influenced by earlier nation-state simulations such as [[Hamurabi|Sumer]], though the concept is taken further with the addition of multiplayer, military battles, and a more sophisticated design.

The game was created by George Geczy and produced and published by [[JMG Software International]], released for the [[TRS-80]] microcomputer system in October 1982.  An updated and expanded version, '''''Supreme Ruler Plus''''', was released in May 1983.<ref>{{cite web|title=Moby Games|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/trs-80/supreme-ruler-plus|accessdate=29 December 2011}}</ref>
