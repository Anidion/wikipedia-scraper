'''''Lost Tomb''''' is an overhead-view [[twin-stick shooter]] written by Dan Lee and released as an [[arcade video game]] by [[Stern (game company)|Stern Electronics]] in 1982. Armed with a gun and whip, the player uses dual joysticks to explore the chambers of a [[South America]]n [[pyramid]] looking for treasure and fighting [[mummy|mummies]], spiders, and scorpions.<ref name=ah/> The game was Stern's first arcade conversion kit<ref name=vg/> and was intended for use with earlier machines from the company.<ref name=ff/>

In 1984, [[Datasoft]] published home ports for [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]], and a [[self-booting disk]] for [[IBM PC compatible]]s.

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to move through the rooms of the [[tomb]], from the top of the pyramid to the base, collecting treasure and looking for the exit. Scorpions, mummies, and spiders attack the player and can be shot. Each room has a time limit.

One [[joystick]] moves the explorer and the other fires the gun in a twin-stick shooter control mechanism. A button swings the [[whip]], which destroys nearby enemies and walls. Both bullets and whips are limited. Chests contain keys and additional bullets and whips.<ref name=atariman/>

After exiting a room, a map showing the levels of the pyramid and connecting stairways is shown. Some rooms lead to a hallway, viewed from the side, where the player must run for the entrance of the next room while being attacked by [[bat]]s.

==Reception==
In 1983, ''Video Games'' magazine called ''Lost Tomb'', "the best ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''-inspired game so far to hit the scene." The reviewer also commented, "the graphics are a bit murky" and "the play is overly complex for most novice arcade enthusiasts."<ref name=vg/>
