'''''Airstrike''''' is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] written by Steven A. Riding for [[Atari 8-bit computers]].<ref name=giantlist/> Having strong similarities to Konami's 1981 ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' arcade game,<ref name=anderson/><ref name=salm/> it was published in 1982 as the first release from UK-based [[English Software]]. In ''Airstrike'', the player flies through caverns while shooting and bombing targets, avoiding terrain, and managing fuel and ammunition. The company described the game as "Very, very, difficult!" in magazine advertisements,<ref name=ad/> and reviewers agreed with that assessment.

''Airstrike'' was followed by ''[[Airstrike II]]'', also programmed by Riding, in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |title=Airstrike II |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-airstrike-ii_158.html |website=Atari Mania}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Airstrike_Atari_8-bit_PAL_screenshot.png|thumb|left|A close encounter between the player's ship and a missile]]

The player controls a ship that flies horizontally to the right through [[cavern]]s. Pressing the [[joystick]] button fires a [[laser]], and the [[space bar]] drops a [[bomb]].<ref name=manual/> As in ''Scramble'', [[fuel]] is limited, but can be replenished by shooting targets marked with an "F". ''Airstrike'' also restricts [[ammunition]]: the ship starts with 40 shots and 10 bombs and more are gained by destroying ammo dumps (marked with an "A"). Surface to air missiles on the terrain launch up toward the ship and can be destroyed when either on the ground or in mid-flight.

There are five difficulty settings.

==Reception==
In a 1982 review for ''[[Electronic Games]]'', Bill Kunkel wrote, "The graphics are absolutely top-notch, perhaps the finest recreation of the sort of coin-op which inspired ''Airstrike'' in the first place." He concluded, "With ''Airstrike'', English Software shows it can produce coin-op look-alikes with the best of them. A new game, however, with a more original play concept, would establish this company as one of the best software producers around."<ref name=kunkel/>

Walter Salm wrote in ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'': "If you're looking for a good home version of ''Scramble'', this is one of the best I've seen yet" and "it's hard as the devil to play–even at the easiest skill level."<ref name=salm/> He mentioned pressing the space bar to drop a bomb as a flaw. In a ''[[Compute!|COMPUTE!]]'' review in 1983, James V. Trunzio disliked that after the player's ship is destroyed, "the next one appears so fast that there is little time to regroup."<ref name=trunzio/> His overall opinion was that, "''Airstrike'' is exactly what it claims to be—a very demanding program."<ref name=trunzio/> ''The Book of Atari Software 1983'' called the game, "nearly impossible to play even on the easiest level," putting part of the blame on the sensitivity of the controls.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Book of Atari Software 1983 |date=1983 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-10286-2 |page=85 |url=https://archive.org/details/book_atari_software_1983/page/n75/mode/2up?q=%22dr.+goodcode%27s+cavern%22}}</ref>

[[John J. Anderson]] covered ''Airstrike'' in a "Five Great Games for the Atari" roundup: "The graphics in this package are fair, though the multicolor character graphics look a bit blocky to me."<ref name=anderson/> He concluded, "In all, a good, but not excellent, effort."
