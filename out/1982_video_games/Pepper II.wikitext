'''''Pepper II''''' is an [[arcade video game]] developed by [[Exidy]] and published in 1982. Despite its name, there was no predecessor named ''Pepper'' or ''Pepper I.''<ref name="Weiss2007">{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Brett|title=Classic home video games, 1972-1984: a complete reference guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&pg=PA188|accessdate=21 May 2013|year=2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786487554|pages=188â€“}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/newarcadegames.php|title=Arcade Games: New Coin-Op Arcade Games|date=Spring 1983|work=Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> As in ''[[Amidar]]'' by Konami and Stern Electronics, the goal is to color the lines on a grid; each rectangle is filled-in after being completely surrounded. Coleco published a port of ''Pepper II'' for its [[ColecoVision]] home system.<ref name=Weiss2007/>

The game plays Gounod's "[[Funeral March of a Marionette]]" when gameplay starts.

==Gameplay==
There are four [[maze]]s per level in ''Pepper II''. Each maze has exits leading to three other mazes. All four mazes must be filled to advance to the next level. To fill in a maze, the player maneuvers "Pepper" around different segments of the maze. As Pepper travels, he leaves a "zipper". Once he encloses or "zips" a segment, it fills in and points are awarded. If Pepper backtracks on an uncompleted segment, it unzips.

The character "Pepper" is an [[angel]]. There are two types of enemies that must be avoided: Roaming Eyes and the Whippersnapper (Zipper Ripper on the ColecoVision version) who unzips all uncompleted, zipped segments by moving over them. Pepper's one defense is to enclose an area containing a [[pitchfork]], which turns him into a [[devil]] for approximately four seconds. At that time he can go after all Roaming Eyes for points while the Whippersnapper freezes. There are four pitchforks in the corners of every maze. A deluxe energizer is located in the center of each maze. This energizer alternates between being a pitchfork and a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] symbol. If Pepper encloses the middle area when the energizer is a halo, the Whippersnapper disappears from the maze.

Points are made for enclosing a segment, consuming a pair of roaming [[eye]]s when energized by the pitchfork (similar to ''[[Pac-Man]]''), obtaining prizes, completing a maze, and completing four mazes. A bonus turn is awarded at 40,000, 50,000, 70,000 or 90,000 points, depending on the dip switch settings.  When a full screen (of the four) has been completely filled, "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" is briefly heard (the same excerpt heard in the middle of the intro of [[The Wonderful World of Disney]] in the 70s and 80s). When four full screens are completed, a small cube appears at the bottom of the screen to mark your progress at completing cubes.

Each maze also contains a prize in one of the segments. The player must enclose the area it appears in to gain the prize and points, and then the prize is shown beneath the maze.
