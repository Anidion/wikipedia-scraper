'''''The Sands of Egypt''''' is a 1982 [[graphic adventure game]] written by James Garon, Ralph Burris, and Steve Bjork of [[Datasoft]] for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]].<ref name=boyle/> It was licensed to [[Tandy Corporation]] and was the first disk-only game for the Color Computer sold by [[RadioShack]].<ref name=boyle/> Ports to [[Atari 8-bit computers]] in 1982 and [[Apple II]] in 1983 were published by Datasoft. Set in 1893, the game follows a  British explorer and archaeologist who is lost in the desert. Text commands are entered in the lower half of the screen, while a sometimes animated image of the current location is displayed in the upper half.

==Gameplay==

The top half of the screen shows an image of the current location. The player interacts with the game by typing commands in the bottom half, as in an [[interactive fiction]] game. Commands are either in a "VERB NOUN" format or single words such as <code>N</code> for "move north". The number of moves made is tracked as the score and can be displayed via the <code>SCORE</code> command. The player needs to periodically drink water to stay alive.

==Reception==
Owen Linzmayer, reviewing the Color Computer original for ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]]'', wrote "In comparison with other adventures, ''The Sands of Egypt'' does feel a bit shallow" and "the game relies strongly on perseverance and patience."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Linzmayer |first1=Owen |title=Colorful Games for the Color Computer |journal=Creative Computing |date=September 1983 |volume=9 |issue=9 |page=148 |url=https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1983-09/page/n151/mode/2up}}</ref> In ''[[Electronic Games]]'', Tracie Forman didn't mention the puzzles, but wrote "By far the most striking thing about ''The Sands of Egypt'' is its eye-pleasing animation" and called it "an exceptional gaming experience."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Forman |first1=Tracie |title=Computer Gaming: The Sands of Egypt |journal=Electronic Games |date=September 1983 |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=72–73 |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_02_Number_07_1983-09_Reese_Communications_US/page/n71/mode/2up}}</ref>

In a walkthrough of part of the game for ''TRS-80 Microcomputer News'', Bruce Elliott discussed the <code>HELP</code> command:{{quote|Unfortunately, it is not always helpful in the immediate situation. I was often told that this was a "DRAINING EXPERIENCE." Standing in the middle of the desert, dying of thirst, this was not exactly what I wanted to read. However, the information ultimately proved a valuable clue.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=Bruce |title=The Sands of Egypt |journal=TRS-80 Microcomputer News |date=March 1983 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=45–47 |url=https://archive.org/details/TRS-80_Microcomputer_News_Volume_5_Issue_03_1983-03_Radio_Shack_US/page/n43/mode/2up}}</ref>}}
