'''''Alien''''' is a 1982 [[List of maze video games|maze video game]] for the [[Atari 2600]] published by Fox Video Games. The game has the player control a human moving through the hallways of a space ship avoiding the adult alien and destroying the small alien eggs. 

Along with ''Mega Force'' and ''[[M*A*S*H (video game)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''Alien'' was among the tie-in video games made for [[20th Century Fox]]'s video game division programmed by [[Doug Neubauer]]. Reviews from ''[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]'' and video game critic Brett Weiss found the game to be derivative of other games like ''[[Pac-Man]]''.

The goal of the game is to move your human character through the hallways of the space ship and crush all the Alien eggs which have been placed there by interacting with them. The goal is crush all the eggs, and collect items for points. The player must avoid or destroy any adult Aliens who also move through the halls. The aliens can be halted briefly in their path by hitting them with a flame thrower, which can only be used once per life. Connecting with a pulsar on the map will make the aliens turn blue for a short time period and killable by interacting with them. If an alien interacts with the player, they lose a life. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.The game used the difficulty switches on the [[Atari 2600]] which changes whether the pulsars make the aliens turn blue or not and changes the movement of the aliens from random to a fixed pattern.{{sfn|Fox Video Games, Inc.|1982|ref=manual}}

Once all the Alien eggs are destroyed, the player enters a bonus round where the goal is to move to the top of the screen and grab the prize shown there within eight seconds. The player does not lose a life in this round.{{sfn|Fox Video Games, Inc.|1982|ref=manual}}

==Development==
[[20th Century Fox]] formed Fox Video Games Inc. in 1982 to produce video games for the Atari Video Computer System (later known as the [[Atari 2600]]).{{sfn|McCullaugh|1982|p=4}}{{sfn|Montfort|2006}}

[[Doug Neubauer]] worked as an independent contractor making film tie-in games for 20th Century Fox's new game division making games such as ''Mega Force'', ''[[M*A*S*H (video game)|M*A*S*H]]'' and ''Alien''. Neubauer had hoped that making several video game adaptations would lead to making a film license like ''[[Star Wars]]'', finding that "just because a company makes a movie doesn't mean they have the rights to make a video of the movie, Case in point, ''Star Wars''. They didn't have the rights to it."{{sfn|Gamasutra|ref=Gamasutra}}

==Release and reception==
''Alien'' was released for the Atari 2600 in November 1982.<ref name="vgu-rel-2600">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]|volume=1|issue=9|date=December 1982|title=Availability Update}}</ref>

From contemporary reviews, ''[[Computer Entertainer|The Video Game Update]]'' did not recommend the game, stating it was a "one more rehash of the eat-the-dot maze" finding the graphics to be "only fair and game play is just too much like other games already available to create much interest."<ref name="vgu-rev-2600">{{cite magazine|magazine=The Video Game Update|volume=1|issue=9|date=December 1982|title=Atari 2600-Compatible}}</ref>

From retrospective reviews, Brett Weiss in his book ''Classic Home Video Games 1972-1984'' referred to the game as a ''Pac-Man'' clone, stating that it was "one of the best movie-based games ever released on the Atari 2600" and that it was derivative of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Freeway (video game)|Freeway]]'', but still "highly playable."{{sfn|Weiss|2007|p=31}} Reviewing the game for the [[Allgame|All Game Guide]], Weiss added that the other drawback was the cartoonish depiction of the aliens, but that "given the graphical limitations of the system, this weakness is understandable."{{sfn|Weiss}} In his overview in video games based on ''Alien'', Graeme Mason of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' wrote that the game "there is a sincere element of panic and fear as the player is talked through the blue maze" but the game was "commendable, if bland".{{sfn|Mason|p=62}}
