'''''Shark! Shark!''''' is an [[Intellivision]] game originally designed by [[Don Daglow]], and with additional design and programming by Ji-Wen Tsao, one of the first female game programmers in the history of video games. The player is a fish who must eat smaller fishes in order to gain points and extra lives while avoiding enemies such as larger fishes, sharks, jellyfish, lobsters and crabs.  After eating a certain number of fish, the player's fish grows in size and is thus able to eat a larger selection of fish.  However, while the larger fish becomes a bit faster, he is less agile than the small fish and has a harder time avoiding enemies.

''Shark! Shark!'' was originally considered by Mattel to be a cute game for kids and unlikely to make strong inroads into the gaming community.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The game was unexpectedly popular, forcing Mattel to quickly manufacture another batch of cartridges.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The original cartridge run was only 5,600 units.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Legacy==
''Shark! Shark!'' was made available for the [[PlayStation 3]] through [[PlayStation Home]] in fall 2012 in a collection titled ''Intellivision Gen2''. In addition to players being a fish eating other fish trying try to take down the shark, their food and foes will both swim in a wide variety of new patterns. It was also released on [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Game Room]]'' service for its [[Xbox 360]] console and for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows-based]] [[personal computer|PC]]s in May 2010.

A new version of ''Shark! Shark!'' was announced for release on the [[Intellivision Amico]] video game console. It is one of the six games that were meant to be included with the console.<ref name="6free">{{cite web |title=Intellivision Amico Pack-in announcement | date=27 March 2020 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh6NSLwmamQ  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/Nh6NSLwmamQ |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|publisher=Intellivision Entertainment |accessdate=29 March 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref> After the indefinite delay of their Amico console, Intellivision announced that mobile versions of ''Shark!

In 2023, BBG Entertainment GmbH acquired the ''Shark! Shark!'' trademark, along with the right to port the Intellivision Amico version of ''Shark! Shark!'' to [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Xbox One]], [[Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X/S]], and Windows and Mac computers.

In his review, Thorpe stated that the gameplay becomes monotonous over 12 rounds of single-player action, but a well-rounded, albeit limited, assortment of gameplay modes does help. Ultimately, the new version received a 71% score from ''Retro Gamer''.{{sfn|Thorpe|p=96}}
