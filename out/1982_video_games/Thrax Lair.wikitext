'''''Thrax Lair''''' is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] designed  by Randy Turner and published by Rantom Software<ref name="manual"/> in 1982 for [[Atari 8-bit computers]].<ref name="atarimania"/> The game is similar in concept to ''[[Caverns of Mars]]'' from 1981.<ref name=kunkel/> A version of ''Thrax Lair'' for the [[Commodore 64]] was planned, but never released.<ref name="C64"/>

==Gameplay==
Viewed from a top-down perspective, the player controls a [[pterodactyl]] like creature on a raid into an underground lair of the insects. The player can fire energy bursts in the front, left and right, and the diagonal front directions. Points are scored by shooting enemies and the faster the player flies the more points are earned.

==Reception==
Norman Schreiber reviewed ''Thrax Lair'' for ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' magazine, and he gave it a 2 out of 5 rating. He concluded: "''Thrax Lair'' certainly is a logical idea for a game. The tragedy is that it's only slightly better than boring."<ref name="EFCG"/>

[[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]] wrote in the July 1983 issue of ''[[Electronic Games]]'': "With a collection of fantastic sound effects and first rate, if spare, graphics, ''Thrax Lair'' makes for an extremely compelling action challenge".<ref name=kunkel>{{cite journal |last1=Kunkel |first1=Bill |title=Computer Gaming: Thrax Lair |journal=Electronic Games |date=July 1983 |pages=72, 74 |url=https://archive.org/details/ElectronicGames/Electronic%20Games%20Issue%2017%20%28July%201983%29/page/n71/mode/2up}}</ref> He compared the vertically scrolling gameplay to ''[[Caverns of Mars]]''. The ''1984 Software Encyclopedia'' from ''Electronic Games'' called ''Thrax Lair'' "exciting if ultimately repetitive."<ref>{{cite book |title=1984 Software Encyclopedia |date=1984 |publisher=Electronic Games |page=58 |url=https://archive.org/details/RetroGameMagazineOneShots/1984%20Software%20Encyclopedia%20%281983%29%20Over%20900%20Descriptions%20and%20Ratings/page/n57/mode/1up}}</ref>
