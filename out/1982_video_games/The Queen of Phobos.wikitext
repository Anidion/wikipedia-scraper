==Reception==
The game was well-received, with Kim Schuette describing it as "A well implemented, nicely paced, fast acting adventure of average difficulty" in his 1984 ''[[Book of Adventure Games]]''.<ref name="Schuette1984"/> Margo Comstock Tommervik of ''[[Softalk]]'' commented that "It's a hi-res adventure, but the graphics—unusual well-done line drawings, not color—are used for a scenario that would do fine as a text adventure, and not for their own sake", concluding "''Queen of Phobos'' offers several evenings of pleasurable, if frustrating, diversion for the adventurer."<ref name="MCT1982">{{cite magazine |last=Comastock Tommervik |first=Margo |date=September 1982 |title=Queen of Phobos |url=https://archive.org/details/softalkv3n01sep1982/page/135 |magazine=Softalk |publisher=Softalk Publishing Inc. |location=North Hollywood, California |volume=3 |issue=1 |page=135 |issn=0274-9629 |via=archive.org}}</ref> In ''[[Creative Computing]]'', Graham Unwin rated ''Queen of Phobos'' a 4/5 for quality of graphics and a 2/5 for complexity.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Unwin |first=Graham |date=October 1983 |title=Adventures in Education |url=https://archive.org/details/Creative_Computing_1983-10/page/n151 |magazine=[[Creative Computing]] |publisher=Ahi Computing, Inc. |location=Morristown, NJ |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=150,156–157 |issn=0097-8140 |via=archive.org}}</ref>
