==Reception==
Dick McGrath reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Time Runner'' may hold out some challenge to nimble-fingered whiz kids, but in my book it only rates about a 5 out of a possible 10 for arcade games."<ref name="CGW8">{{cite magazine |last=McGrath |first=Dick |title=Route 80: The Road to TRS-80 Gaming |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jan–Feb 1983 |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=38–39}}</ref>
