'''''Guadalcanal Campaign''''' is a 1982 [[computer wargame]] developed by [[Gary Grigsby]] and published by [[Strategic Simulations|Strategic Simulations, Inc.]] (SSI). It was Grigsby's first released game and has been cited as the first [[monster wargame]] made for computers.

''Guadalcanal Campaign'' was a commercial and critical success that helped to establish Grigsby in the game industry. Grigsby followed it with ''[[Bomb Alley]]''. Continuing to work with SSI, he went on to become a prominent name in the computer wargame field, releasing 23 games with the company by 1996.

==Development==
''Guadalcanal Campaign'' was the first game released by designer [[Gary Grigsby]]. He recalled beginning development in December 1981.<ref name=retrogamer1>{{cite journal | author=Ritchie, Craig | title=Developer Lookback; Strategic Simulations Inc (Part 1 of 2) | journal=[[Retro Gamer]] | issue=42 | date=October 2007 | pages=34–39 }}</ref> In early 1982, while phoning [[Strategic Simulations]]' hotline about its game ''[[Torpedo Fire]]'', he got into a conversation with company head [[Joel Billings]] that led to an offer to publish ''Guadalcanal Campaign''. Grigsby said that he had "nearly completed a crude working version" by the time that he talked to Billings.<ref name=witeint>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203052400/http://www.wargamer.com/article/2983/war-in-the-east-developers | url=http://www.wargamer.com/article/2983/war-in-the-east-developers | title=Interview: ''War in the East'' Developers | date=January 23, 2011 | author=Staff | work=[[Wargamer (website)|Wargamer]] | archivedate=February 3, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Grigsby developed the game in his spare time at night while working a day job at the [[United States Department of Defense]],<ref name=witeint /> an arrangement he called "incredibly hard". He later said that he had made "a lot of little fragments of games" before ''Guadalcanal Campaign'', but that it was the first full project he had undertaken.<ref name=wargamer>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220105733/http://www.wargamer.com/article/1383/Interview-Joel-Billings-and-Gary-Grigsby?page=1 | url=http://www.wargamer.com/article/1383/Interview-Joel-Billings-and-Gary-Grigsby?page=1 | title=Interview: Joel Billings and Gary Grigsby | date=July 16, 2003 | work=[[Wargamer (website)|Wargamer]] | author1=Zabek, Jim | author2=Wallace, Shaun | archivedate=February 20, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Guadalcanal Campaign'' was released in 1982,<ref name=retrogamer1 /> after roughly 8 months of work.<ref name=history>{{cite magazine | author=Grigsby, Gary | author-link=Gary Grigsby | title=The History of a Wargame Design | date=November–December 1982 | volume=2 | number=6 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=11, 12 }}</ref>

==Reception==
''Guadalcanal Campaign'' was a commercial success. According to Craig Ritchie of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', it sold roughly 3,500 copies, which he called "an outstanding figure for such a niche market".<ref name=retrogamer1 />

Richard Charles Karr reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "It is this writer's opinion that ''Guadalcanal Campaign'' is the best historical simulation (and one of their best games) from SSI to date. The essential aspects of historicity and playability are well-matched, with easy accessibility of gaming information, a well-organized set of rules, and good research combining to provide for a game that will keep you at your computer for days at a time."<ref name="CGW6">{{cite magazine |last=Karr |first=Richard Charles |title=Guadalcanal Campaign: Review & Notes |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September–October 1982 |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=16–17, 19, 46}}</ref> Rich Sutton of ''Video Games'' called it "one of the best simulations available for beginner and expert alike".<ref name=videogames>{{cite journal | author=Sutton, Rich | title=War Games: A Battle Plan for Attacking Video Simulations | volume=2 | number=1 | date=October 1993 | journal=Video Games | pages=40, 41, 44–48 }}</ref>
