'''''The Arcade Machine''''' is a [[game creation system]] written by Chris Jochumson and [[Doug Carlston]] for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Broderbund]] in 1982.<ref name=giantlist/> Louis Ewens ported it to [[Atari 8-bit computers]].<ref name=giantlist/> Broderbund ran a contest from January–June 1984 where the best user-created game was awarded a prize of $1,500 in hardware and software.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fi4EAAAAMBAJ |title=InfoWorld |date=30 January 1984| publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc. |via=Google Books}}</ref> Jochumson also wrote ''[[Track Attack]]'' for Broderbund.

==Gameplay==
The game allows players to create alien attacks like those seen in ''[[Galaxian]]''. The inbuilt editor allows players to: design/animate enemies, players and explosions; give enemies instructions on moving/firing; drawing backgrounds/title screens, creating sound effects/music, and setting various gameplay rules. Finished games can be saved to a [[self-booting disk]] to allow them to run without this program.<ref name="manual">{{cite book |title=The Arcade Machine Manual |date=1982 |publisher=Broderbund |url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/manuals/atari8bit/arcade_machine.pdf}}</ref>

==Reception==
John F. Besnard reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The product itself provides a tremendous amount of power to the user. Try a few of the demo games supplied on the back of the disk to see the versatility potential of the product."<ref name="CGW8">{{cite magazine |last=Besnard |first=John F. |title=The Arcade Machine |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jan–Feb 1983 |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=32, 45}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' described the game as a "hierophant" due to giving non-programmers the ability to create games; furthermore, the publication suggested that with a bit of aesthetic improvement, ''The Arcade Machine'' would "be a game one can play almost forever".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/24/science/personal-computers-the-imaginative-path-to-designing-games.html|title=THE IMAGINATIVE PATH TO DESIGNING GAMES|date=24 May 1983|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

In 1984, ''[[InfoWorld]]'' deemed it a "fabulous program," and compared it favourably to ''[[Pinball Construction Set]]''.<ref name="auto"/>

Steve Panak of ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' wrote, "''The Arcade Machine'' is not for the weak of stomach, nor for the weak of mind. Complexity is a key word here. However, despite its complexity, the program is surprisingly user-friendly, thanks to excellent documentation." In the conclusion he warned, "Many, many, many hours are needed to create and hone your game to perfection-and that's if you're not a perfectionist."<ref name=panak>{{cite journal|title=The Season's Software Sampler |issue=25 |date=December 1984 |last1=Panak |first=Steve |journal=ANALOG Computing |url=http://www.cyberroach.com/analog/an25/seasonsoftware.htm}}</ref>

The game was "a best seller", according to the September 1984 issue of ''[[Creative Computing]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Creative Computing |last1=Uston |first1=Ken |date=September 1984 |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n9/157_A_family_affair_behind_t.php|title=A family affair; behind the scenes at Broderbund. |volume=10 | issue=9 |page=157}}</ref>
