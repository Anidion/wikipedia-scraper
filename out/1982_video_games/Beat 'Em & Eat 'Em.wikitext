'''''Beat 'Em and Eat 'Em'''''{{efn|Also known as '''''Mystique Presents Swedish Erotica: Beat 'Em and Eat 'Em'''''}} is a [[adult video games|pornographic video game]] for the [[Atari 2600]] made by [[American Multiple Industries]] in 1982. Players control two [[nudity|nude]] women; the goal is to catch [[semen]] in their mouths, which is falling from a [[masturbation|masturbating]] man on a rooftop, without missing. Its gameplay has been compared to the Atari game ''[[Kaboom! (video game)|Kaboom!]]''. There is also a gender-reversed version of the game titled '''''Philly Flasher''''' that features identical gameplay. ''Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em'' has received negative reviews since its release and is an oft-cited example of pornographic Atari 2600 games.

==Gameplay==
Players control two [[nudity|nude]] women on the street who must catch [[semen]] in their mouths that comes from a [[masturbation|masturbating]] man on a rooftop without missing. This can be accomplished merely by semen touching the women's bodies before it hits the ground. A more difficult setting requires players to catch the semen before it goes past the women's shoulders. If the player successfully catches all the semen in one round, the two women lick their lips and the game progresses to the next round. If any semen hits the ground, the first turn is over. Players are allowed to miss four times before the game is over. They can gain a turn every 69 points scored (up to two extra turns). Players move both women using the controller's paddle and the game allows each player to control one woman. The game plays similarly to the Atari game ''[[Kaboom! (video game)|Kaboom!]]'' (1981).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gonzales |first=Lauren |date=2004-03-07 |title=When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-two-tribes-go-to-war-a-history-of-video-game-controversy/1100-6090892/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213652/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-two-tribes-go-to-war-a-history-of-video-game-controversy/1100-6090892/ |archive-date=2015-05-09 |access-date=2013-12-17 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref><ref name="allgame">{{Cite web |last1=Schwartz |first1=Michael |last2=Dykman |first2=Joan |title=Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=8959 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210171534/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=8959 |website=[[AllGame]] |archive-date=2014-12-10 |access-date=2010-04-26}}</ref><ref name="ign" /><ref name="techtell" />

''Philly Flasher'' is a gender swapped version of the game in which the player controls two male prisoners with their genitals exposed catching lactation from an old witch's breast. Instead of licking their lips, the two men will masturbate if the player successfully catches every drop of lactate.

==Release==
''Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em'' was published and developed by [[American Multiple Industries]] and JHM Ltd. in 1982.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=April 1983 |title=Vid-Custer's Last Stand |url=http://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_07_1983-04_Pumpkin_Press_US |magazine=Video Games |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=12-13 |via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> 

A gender-reversed version of the game was later released in a "double-ender" cartridge along with ''Cathouse Blues'' as ''Philly Flasher'', in which the player is tasked with controlling two male prisoners with visibly erect penises as they attempt to catch drops of [[breast milk]] lactated by a witch. All gameplay mechanics are identical to the original, save for the fact that when the men catch all the milk, they [[masturbate]] and ejaculate.<ref name="atariguideflasher">{{Cite web |title=Philly Flasher/Cathouse Blues |url=http://www.atariguide.com/3/351.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030424104950/http://www.atariguide.com/3/351.htm |archive-date=24 April 2003 |access-date=2010-04-26 |website=AtariGuide}}</ref> The rights for sales and distribution were taken over by GameSource, which changed the line of adult video games (which included ''Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em'') to "PlayAround". The company created multiple "double-ender" cartridges which included two of these adult games in one. One of these was a compilation of ''Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em'' and ''Lady in Wading''.<ref name="ahq">{{Cite web |title=PlayAround |url=http://www.atarihq.com/2678/3party/playarnd.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102212708/http://www.atarihq.com/2678/3party/playarnd.html |archive-date=2014-01-02 |access-date=2014-01-01 |website=AtariHQ.com}}</ref>
A homebrew port of the game for the [[NES]] was developed in 2014 by FG Software.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Beat Em |url=https://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=30&products_id=139 |website=RetroUSB.com |access-date=2023-12-21}}</ref>

He also criticized the level of eroticism stating, "There's something non-erotic about skipping past the courting, past the foreplay, past the actual sex, and getting straight to the sperm-swallowing.
