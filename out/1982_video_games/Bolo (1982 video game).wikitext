'''''Bolo''''' is a video game written by Jim Lane for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and published by [[Synergistic Software]] in 1982.<ref name=giantlist/> It was inspired by [[Keith Laumer]]'s 1976 science fiction novel ''[[Bolo: Annals of the Dinochrome Brigade]]'', which featured [[Bolo (tank)|self-aware tanks]].<ref name="PopularComputing" />

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Bolo 1982 Apple II screenshot 1.png|thumb|Gameplay screenshot]]
Upon startup ''Bolo'' requests a level number (1–9) and density (1–5);<ref name="Byte"/> the game then generates a random rectangular [[maze]] containing six enemy bases. The higher the density specified, the more walls appear in the maze. The player controls a [[tank]], and must destroy the six enemy bases to advance to the next level. The player can view 1/132 of the maze at one time;<ref name="PopularComputing" /> indicators on the right side of the screen show the player's position within the maze, the direction of the enemy bases and the [[fuel]] remaining.

Enemy tanks constantly emerge from each of the six enemy bases. Different levels feature different types of enemy tanks; some move randomly while others pursue the player. All enemy tanks fire deadly shells. If the player collides with a [[bullet]], an enemy base or tank, or a wall, a turn is lost. A turn is also lost if the player runs out of fuel; destroying an enemy base will replenish the player's fuel supply. The player is provided with four tanks per game, and no opportunity is provided to earn more.

Once all six enemy bases are destroyed, the player is presented with a congratulatory message from the Dinochrome Brigade, and a new maze (with the same level and density) is generated.

The player can turn the tank's gun turret with 1 and 2 keys, a necessity in more advanced levels as enemies give chase as fast as the player's tank can move.

''Bolo'' uses pixel-perfect collision detection.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

== Reception ==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' in 1983 said that ''Bolo'' "is a hot game. Who ever said that the only good arcade games were in the arcades? ... Animation, graphics, playability—''Bolo'' is in every way a superior 'game' to ''[[Tron (video game)|Tron]]''".<ref name="hunter198303" /> ''[[Electronic Games]]'' called the game's graphics "a bit plain" compared to [[Sir-Tech]]'s ''[[Star Maze]]'', but "''Bolo'''s play-action is, in its way, every bit as entertaining as the earlier game".<ref name="davidson198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n69/mode/2up | title=Bolo | work=Electronic Games | date = June 1983 | accessdate=6 January 2015 | author=Davidson, Steve | pages=72}}</ref> ''Bolo'' tied ''[[Choplifter]]'' for SoftTalk Magazine's #1 game for the year 1982.<ref>[http://www.techipedia.com/2006/revisiting-the-80s-apple-ii-games/#comment-73482 Forum post from James Lane, author of ''Bolo'']</ref>
