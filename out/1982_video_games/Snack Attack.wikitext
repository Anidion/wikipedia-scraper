'''''Snack Attack''''' is a [[maze video game]] developed by Dan Illowsky for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Datamost]] in 1981. ''Snack Attack'' is a [[Pac-Man clone|''Pac-Man'' clone]].

==Gameplay==
The player controls the Snacker, a small, white, fish-like character, and moves through a [[maze]] to "eat" all the [[gumdrop]]s scattered throughout. Gumdrop Guards, four enemies that patrol the maze, attempt to catch the Snacker. There are green and purple barriers that can only be crossed by the Snacker and the Guards, respectively.

The character can move in four directions, allowing the player to escape the Gumdrop Guards. 

By eating one of several "magic stars" in the maze, the Snacker gains a set of sharp teeth and can briefly eat the guards for bonus points, sending them back to their home base to regenerate. Occasionally, a giant [[jack-o-lantern]] appears and can be eaten for bonus points. Once all the gumdrops have been cleared, the player begins the next maze at a faster speed. The game cycles through three different mazes.

==Reception==
The game debuted in October 1981, and sold 25,000 copies by June 1982, tied for fourth on ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s list of top sellers.<ref name="lombardy1982sepoct">{{cite magazine |title=Inside the Industry |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=2&id=6 |format=PDF |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |page=2 | date=September–October 1982 | access-date= 2016-03-28}}</ref> ''Snack Attack'' won an award in the category of "Best Solitaire Computer Game" at the 4th annual [[Arkie Awards]], where judges praised its "multiple mazes, charming graphics and sound effects, and well-nigh-addictive play action".
