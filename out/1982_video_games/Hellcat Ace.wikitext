'''''Hellcat Ace''''' is a 1982 [[combat flight simulator]] [[video game]] written by [[Sid Meier]] for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published by [[MicroProse]] as their first program. The game was an immediate hit and led Meier to write several new releases for the Atari home computers. Ports of ''Hellcat Ace'' were released for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1983 and [[IBM PC compatible]]s  in 1984.

==Gameplay==
The player flies the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]] in a series of missions. The initial screen allows the user to select a mission from 1 to 10, each with increasing difficulty. An additional four missions are listed but cannot be selected directly in the original version. When a mission is successfully completed, the game moves onto the next mission.{{sfn|Plotkin|1983|p=82}}

On entering a mission the player is inside the Hellcat flying over the Pacific Ocean. They normally start at 10,000 feet altitude, flying north at 200 mph. In the first mission, Flying Tiger, the task is to shoot down a Japanese bomber which is placed directly in front of the player at the same altitude and thus easily shot down with a single burst from the guns. In the second mission, Pearl Harbor, the bomber is replaced by a somewhat tougher float plane, and so forth.{{sfn|Plotkin|1983|p=82}}

==Development and release==
[[Sid Meier]] purchased an [[Atari 800]] computer in 1980 and began writing games in [[Atari BASIC]]. He showed his first work, ''Hostage Rescue'', to his parents; his mother became so engrossed that she had to force herself to drop the joystick and walk away.{{sfn|Jahromi|2021}}

In 1982, Meier was working for [[General Instrument]] in [[Baltimore]]. Mutual friends knew of Meier's interest in [[flight simulator]]s and introduced him to [[Bill Stealey]], a former military pilot who then worked in strategic planning at the company. The two met in [[Las Vegas]] in the summer of 1982 while at meetings, and found [[Red Baron (1980 video game)|''Red Baron'']] in the arcade at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]]. Meier repeatedly beat Stealey at the game, as Meier was able to consistently predict the game's next moves.{{sfn|CGW|1988|p=9}}

Meier claimed he could write a better game than ''Red Baron'' on his [[home computer]] in one week; Stealey replied that he would sell it if Meier could write it. Despite Meier's initial one-week estimate, ''Hellcat Ace'' took two months to complete. Stealey sold fifty copies at his first sales meeting, and [[MicroProse]] was formed to sell the game.{{sfn|CGW|1988|p=9}} In a 1996 interview, Stealey recalled posing as a customer and calling computer stores to ask if they carried ''Hellcat Ace''; he would then later call the stores as himself, and sell the game to them.<ref name="Ranii 1996">{{cite news|last=Ranii|first=David|title=Wild Bill is flying again|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/116425764/the-news-and-observer/|date=September 15, 1996|newspaper=[[The News & Observer]]|location=Raleigh, North Carolina|page=4F|access-date=January 14, 2023|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> He stated, "All these guys ended up being my regular customers. They all knew the scam I pulled on them and they all said, 'Bill, it was a great game.' And they sold a ton."<ref name="Ranii 1996" />

''Hellcat Ace'' was a success and led to several new games in quick succession; ''[[Spitfire Ace]]'' was a modified ''Hellcat Ace'' released the same year,<ref>{{cite book|last=Meier|first=Sid|author-link=Sid Meier|date=2020|title=Sid Meier's Memoir!: A Life in Computer Games|publisher=[[W.

Many years later, the original MGM Grand ''Red Baron'' machine was tracked down with the help of [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]] executives, and installed in the MicroProse offices.{{sfn|CGW|1988|p=9}}

==Reception==
''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' reviewed the game in May 1983, summing it up by saying "While the graphics are not stunning, the game plays well and holds your interest with multiple skill levels and a variety of scenarios." The reviewer praised the overall simulation, noting that "Fancy aerobatics are easily done; loops, barrel rolls, split 'S' and Immelman turns are all possible". It concludes by saying the only obvious improvement would be better graphical effects, but that this did not detract from the playability, recommending it to anyone with an interest in flight simulators.{{sfn|Plotkin|1983|p=82}}

''[[Page 6]]'' also reviewed the game in their May 1983 issue. Mirroring the ''Antic'' review, they note "The graphics are simple but the overall effect is quite stunning... This is a great simulation giving a real feel of action."<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Page 6 |title=Hellcat Ace | url=https://archive.org/details/Page6-03-May83/page/22/mode/2up | pages=23–24 |date=May 1983 }}</ref> ''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' reviewed both Hellcat Ace and Spitfire Ace in their January 1984 issue, saying "The games' graphics are extremely simple" but otherwise gives it a positive review, stating that "While Commodore 64 and Atari owners still don't have access to anything as sophisticated as the Flight Simulator, they now have Hellcat Ace and Spitfire Ace, programs that could produce some vertigo in people with a lot of imagination."<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine= Softline |url=https://archive.org/details/Softline_Magazine_Issue_3.3/page/n51/mode/2up |title=Spitfire Ace and Hellcat Ace |date=January-February 1984 |pages=51–52}}</ref>
