==Reception==
Mark Bausman reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The game plays well but I found the constant shifts in wind to be a bit frustrating. The instruction book is very helpful and gives many hints on how to play this game. It also includes a little historical background on Clipper ships and a playing aid to help novice sailors keep their Clipper on course."<ref name="CGW11">{{cite magazine |last=Bausman |first=Mark |title=Micro-Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Julâ€“Aug 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=44}}</ref>
