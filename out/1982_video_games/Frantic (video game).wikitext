'''''Frantic''''' is a [[VIC-20]] space [[shoot 'em up]] published by [[Imagine Software]] on cassette in 1982. A [[ZX Spectrum]] 48K version was planned, but never released.<ref>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0013478 Frantic]. World of Spectrum.</ref>

==Gameplay==
The player pilots a space ship while trying to keep an X and Y axis centered on the enemy, which enters the field of play at varying speeds and directions. Slower enemies appear horizontally and quicker enemies diagonally. The game's title alludes to the fact that the game is timed, as fuel levels deplete during play. Centering the X and Y axis to target enemies involves engaging thrusters which in turn burns fuel. The game can be played with either a joystick or keyboard.
