{{nihongo foot|'''''Dig Dug'''''|ディグダグ|Digu Dagu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[maze video game|maze]] [[arcade video game]] released by [[Namco]] in 1982. It was distributed in North America by [[Atari, Inc.]] The player digs underground tunnels to attack enemies in each level, by either inflating them to bursting or crushing them underneath rocks.

''Dig Dug'' was planned and designed by Masahisa Ikegami, with help from ''[[Galaga]]'' creator Shigeru Yokoyama. It was programmed for the [[Namco Galaga]] arcade board by Shouichi Fukatani, who worked on many of Namco's earlier arcade games, along with Toshio Sakai. Music was composed by Yuriko Keino, including the character movement jingle at executives' request, as her first Namco game. Namco heavily marketed it as a "strategic digging game".

Upon release, ''Dig Dug'' was well received by critics for its addictive gameplay, cute characters, and strategy. During the [[golden age of arcade video games]], it was globally successful, including as the second highest-grossing arcade game of 1982 in Japan. It prompted a long series of sequels and spin-offs, including the ''[[Mr. Driller]]'' series, for several platforms. It is in many [[List of Bandai Namco video game compilations|Namco video game compilations]] for many systems.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Digdug.png|upright=2|left|thumb|Arcade version screenshot]]
''Dig Dug'' is a maze video game. The player controls protagonist Dig Dug (Taizo Hori) to eliminate each screen's enemies: [[Púca|Pooka]]s, red creatures with comically large goggles; and Fygars, fire-breathing green [[dragon]]s. Dig Dug can use an air pump to inflate them to bursting or crush them under large falling rocks. Bonus points are awarded for squashing multiple enemies with a single rock, and dropping two rocks in a stage yields a bonus item, which can be eaten for points. Once all the enemies have been defeated, Dig Dug progresses to the next stage.<ref name="FC manual">{{cite book |title=Dig Dug instruction manual (FC) |date=1985 |publisher=Namco |pages=9 |url=http://www.videogameden.com/fc/extra/dig.pdf}}</ref>

Enemies chase Dig Dug through dirt in the form of ghostly eyes, only becoming solid in the air where his pump can stun or destroy them. Enemies eventually become faster and more aggressive and the last one then attempts escape. Later stages vary in dirt color, while increasing the number and speed of enemies.<ref name="FC manual"/>

The game has 256 stages.

The first home conversion of ''Dig Dug'' was released for the [[Atari 2600]] in 1983, developed and published by Atari, which was followed by versions for the [[Atari 5200]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Apple II]]. In Japan, it was ported to the [[Casio PV-1000]] in 1983, the [[MSX]] in 1984, and the [[Famicom]] in 1985. [[Gakken]] produced a handheld LCD tabletop game in 1983, which replaced Dig Dug's air pump with a flamethrower to accommodate hardware limitations. Namco released a [[Game Boy]] conversion in North America only in 1992, with an all-new game called "New Dig Dug" where the player must collect keys to open an exit door; this version was later included in the 1996 Japan-only compilation ''Namco Gallery Vol. 2'', which also includes ''[[Galaxian]]'', ''[[The Tower of Druaga]]'', and ''Famista 4''.<ref name="HG101"/> A Japanese [[X68000]] version was developed by Dempa and released in 1995, bundled with ''[[Dig Dug II]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Masuda |first1=Atsushi |title=『ディグダグ』 パソコン版とアーケード版の"差"に増田少年愕然！ |url=https://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/column/masudaretro/1032200.html |website=AKIBA PC-Watch |access-date=19 November 2016}}</ref> The Famicom version was re-released in Japan for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2004 as part of the ''[[Classic NES Series|Famicom Mini]]'' series.<ref name="HG101"/>

''Dig Dug'' prompted a long series of sequels for several platforms.

He became a prominent character in Namco's own ''[[Mr. Driller]]'' series, where he is revealed to be the father of Susumu Hori and being married to ''[[Baraduke]]'' protagonist Masuyo Tobi, who would divorce for unknown reasons.
