'''''Black Widow''''' is a [[multidirectional shooter]] developed by [[Atari, Inc.]] and  released in arcades in 1982. The game uses color [[vector graphics]]. The player controls a [[latrodectus|black widow spider]] via two joysticks, one to move and one to fire, defending the web from insects.

''Black Widow'' was offered as a conversion kit for ''[[Gravitar]]'' (1982), a game which was not commercially successful.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The kit uses the original ''Gravitar'' [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] with a few modifications and a new set of ROM chips. Many factory-built ''Black Widow'' machines were produced using unsold ''Gravitar'' cabinets with ''Black Widow'' side-art applied over the ''Gravitar'' sideart.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

To destroy certain enemies, the player must lure other enemies into destroying them. The Bug Slayer is a bug that helps the player eliminate enemies, with loss of potential points being the only consequence. The Bug Slayer can help the player in tough situations, but can also prevent the player from achieving the number of extra lives necessary to endure later, more difficult, rounds.

Other enemies appear on the playing field as eggs, laid by other enemies. The player can move these eggs off the playing field to both eliminate the enemy and receive points, before they reach maturity.

===Enemies and scoring===
* [[Mosquito]] - if shot, becomes '$'.
* [[Beetle]] - eats '$', but if shot, becomes '$'.
* [[Hornet]] - lays an egg on '$', but if shot, becomes '$'.
* Egg - grows to become hornet or spoiler. Must be pushed off the web to score 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, or even 2500 points.
* Grub Steak - tag for 500, 250, 100, or 50 pointsâ€”the sooner the better.
* Spoiler - invulnerable, can only be destroyed by a grenade bug, bug slayer or rocket bug.
* Grenade Bug - explodes if shot. Bugs and eggs within the kill zone score 500 points each.
* Rocket Bug - invulnerable. Launches "rockettes" at black widow from the other bugs it tags. Shoot rockettes to score 1000 points each.
* Thunderbug - if shot, it breaks formation and attacks. If shot again, it explodes all other T-bugs for 5000 points. Keep away from all T-bugs to earn 10000 points. The resulting chain reaction from multiple thunderbugs is very dangerous and can encompass over 80% of the level at some times, depending on how many T-bugs are involved.
* Bug Slayer - harmless to the player and invulnerable. The Bug Slayer competes with the Black Widow for food. Beat it to its flashing prey for points.
