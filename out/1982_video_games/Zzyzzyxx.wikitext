'''''Zzyzzyxx''''' is a stand-up coin-operated arcade game developed by [[RDI Video Systems|Advanced Microcomputer Systems]], and manufactured by [[Cinematronics]] in 1982. It was retitled as '''''Brix''''' for release as a conversion kit in 1983. The title screen and marquee were the only changes.

==Game concept== 
The object of the game is to guide the protagonist, named Zzyzzyxx, through a moving maze of bricks to collect gifts and bring them to the fair-haired Lola, the object of his affection.  Zzyzzyxx is opposed by the evil trio by the names Boris, Bluto and Smoot, also known as the Rattifers. These three will try to intercept Zzyzzyxx as he makes his way through the maze.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Coinop.org /// Zzyzzyxx (1983)|url=https://www.coinop.org/game/100516/Zzyzzyxx.html|access-date=2022-12-04|website=www.coinop.org}}</ref> He can collect a helmet in the maze, which can be used to imprison a Rattifer inside a brick, or to break a brick in the row above to move through the maze.  As the levels progress, Zzyzzyxx must avoid crumbling bricks, rising missiles, and dropping bombs. The game has a 1up player score and laps tallied at the top of the screen.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ZZYZZYXX, Arcade Video game by Cinematronics, Inc.
