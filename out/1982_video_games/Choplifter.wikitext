'''''Choplifter''''' (stylized as '''''Choplifter!''''') is a military themed [[scrolling shooter]] developed by [[Dan Gorlin]] for the  [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and published by [[Broderbund]] in 1982. It was ported to [[Atari 8-bit computers]] the same year and also to the [[VIC-20]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari 5200]] (released in February 1984),<ref name="CE">{{cite magazine |title=Year-End Index |magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]] |date=January 1985 |volume=3 |issue=10 |page=156 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/newsletters/video_game_update/computer_entertainer_jan85.pdf#page=12}}</ref> [[ColecoVision]], [[MSX]], and [[Thomson computers]].

In 1985, [[Sega]] released a coin-operated [[arcade video game|arcade]] [[Video game remake|remake]], which in turn was ported to the [[Master System]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in 1986. ''Choplifter'' is one of the few games that first appeared on a home system and was ported to the arcades. Graphically enhanced versions for the Atari 8-bit computers and [[Atari 7800]] were also published in 1988 by [[Atari Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Choplifter!|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-choplifter_17338.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
In ''Choplifter'', the player assumes the role of a combat [[helicopter]] [[aviator|pilot]]. The player attempts to save hostages being held in barracks in territory ruled by the evil Bungeling Empire. The player must collect the hostages (described in the backstory as "delegates to the United Nations Conference on Peace and Child Rearing") and transport them safely to the nearby U.S. Postal Service building, all the while fighting off hostile [[tank]]s and other enemy combatants.<ref name="game-box">{{cite video game |title=Choplifter |developer=Broderbund |year=1982 |platform=Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64 |scene=game packaging}}</ref><ref name="book">{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Tony|title=1001 videos games you must play before you die|date=2013|publisher=Cassell Illustrated|location=London|isbn=9781844037667|edition=Revised and updated}}</ref> According to the backstory, the helicopter parts were smuggled into the country, disguised as a "mail-sorting machine".

The helicopter can face three directions: left, right, or forward (facing the player). It may shoot at enemies in any of these directions and need not fly in the same direction it is facing. The forward-facing mode is used primarily to shoot tanks. The player must be careful to protect the hostages from enemy fire as well as avoid hitting the hostages with his own fire.

The player rescues the prisoners by first shooting one of the hostage buildings to release them, landing to allow the prisoners to board the [[sortie]], and returning them to the player's starting point. Each of the four buildings holds 16 hostages, and only 16 passengers can be carried at a time, so several trips must be made. When the chopper is full, no more hostages will attempt to board; they will wave the helicopter off and wait for its return. Usually, each trip back is riskier than the last, since the enemy is alerted and has deployed a counter-attack.

If the player lands directly on top of a hostage, or completely blocks the building exit, the hostages will be killed. In the Apple II and Atari 7800 versions, hostages also die if the vehicle is not landed correctly (it is slightly tilted), being crushed as they attempt to board the chopper. While grounded, the helicopter may be attacked by enemy tanks, which it can shoot at only by returning to the air. Also, the enemy scrambles jet fighters which can attack the vehicle in the air with [[air-to-air missile]]s or on the ground with bombs.

==Development==
Coming off a stint working for the [[Rand Corporation]], Dan Gorlin initially developed ''Choplifter'' using an Apple II loaned to him by his grandfather.<ref name="Gamasutra">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134956/choplifter_from_1982_to_2012.php?print=1|title=Choplifter: From 1982 to 2012|author=Frank Cifaldi|date=January 13, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2018|work=Gamasutra|author-link=Frank Cifaldi}}</ref> At first Gorlin imagined ''Choplifter'' as a 3D game, but switched to a traditional 2D game environment due to technical limitations.

The game was developed in six months. After Gorlin began experimenting with animating a helicopter on the Apple II, he added scenery, tanks, and planes, with the hostages added last. He stated that, as a story developed, "movie camera techniques seemed appropriate", including the final message "The End" instead of "Game Over". Gorlin's first demonstration to Broderbund was "too realistic, too much a helicopter simulation", and the company helped him make it easier to fly.{{r|salmons198207}} The concept of rescuing hostages came about after Gorlin learned about ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]'', in which the player must protect people on the ground. Although the [[Iran hostage crisis]] ended the year before the game was released, Gorlin said "the tie-in with current events was something that never really crossed my mind until we published".<ref name=halcyon>{{cite web|url=https://dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/GORLIN.HTM |title=Halcyon Days |date=1997 |last1=Hague |first1=James}}</ref>

Gorlin would later revisit the 3D concept in a failed attempt to remake the game in the 1990s.<ref name="Gamasutra" />

==Reception==
Debuting in May 1982, the game sold 9,000 copies by June, appearing on ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s list of top sellers.<ref name="lombardy1982sepoct">{{cite magazine |title=Inside the Industry |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=2&id=6 |format=PDF |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |page=2 |date=September–October 1982 |accessdate= 2016-03-28}}</ref> ''II Computing'' listed ''Choplifter'' seventh on the magazine's list of top Apple II games as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data.<ref name="ciraolo198510_11">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/II_Computing_Vol_1_No_1_Oct_Nov_85_Premiere#page/n51/mode/2up | title=Top Software / A List of Favorites | work=II Computing | date=Oct–Nov 1985 | accessdate=28 January 2015 | author=Ciraolo, Michael | pages=51}}</ref>

===Reviews===
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' in 1982 called the game "what may well be the first Interactive Computer-Assisted Animated Movie. A fusion of arcade gaming, simulation, and filmic visual aesthetics, ''Choplifter'' is destined to occupy a place in the software Hall of Fame". The magazine praised the animation and the helicopter's "subtle flight control", and concluded that seeing the hostages' "hope and excitement, their faith in you" made the game "hard to play. It hurts to see one of those lively people killed".<ref name="salmons198207">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=6&id=6 | title=The Choppers of Mercy | work=Softline | date=July 1982 | accessdate=17 July 2014 | author=Salmons, Jim | pages=18}}</ref> In 1983 its readers named ''Choplifter'' fourth on the magazine's Top Thirty list of Atari 8-bit programs by popularity.<ref name="softline198303">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=6&id=10 | title=The Most Popular Atari Program Ever | work=Softline | date=March 1983 | accessdate=28 July 2014 | pages=44}}</ref> ''[[BYTE]]'' called ''Choplifter'' "great fun".<ref name="byte198212">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-12/1982_12_BYTE_07-12_Game_Plan_1982#page/n85/mode/2up | title=The Coinless Arcade - Rediscovered | work=BYTE | date=December 1982 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author1=Clark, Pamela | author2=Williams, Gregg | pages=84}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'',<ref>{{citation | date = July–August 1982 | last = Greenlaw | first = Stanley | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Choplifter!

==Legacy==
''[[Choplifter II]]'', subtitled "Rescue Survive", was released for the [[Game Boy]] in 1991, then remade for both the Game Boy and [[Game Gear]] as ''[[Choplifter III]]'' in 1994. An unrelated ''[[Choplifter III]]'' was released for [[Super NES]].

In late 1997, Gorlin and his development team, Ariok Entertainment, were working on a ''Choplifter'' game for IBM PC compatibles which would be in 3D and have multiplayer functionality.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=In the Studio |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=38 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1998|page=28}}</ref> The game was never released.

Sega released a pair of [[spiritual successor]]s without the ''Choplifter'' brand:
* ''[[Air Rescue]]'' (1991) for the [[Sega System 32]] arcade hardware is a first-person, [[pseudo-3D]] take on the concept. 
* ''[[Air Rescue]]'' (1992) for [[Master System]] more closely resembles 2D ''Choplifter'', but has stages that scroll in all directions.

Programmer Will Botti cited ''Choplifter'' as a major inspiration for his 1996 game ''[[Black Dawn (video game)|Black Dawn]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Behind the Screens|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=87 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=October 1996|page=158}}</ref>

In 2004, [[Xicat Interactive]] published ''ChopLifter: Crisis Shield'' only in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/15/choplifter/|title = ChopLifter &#91;PS2 - Cancelled?&#93; - Unseen64|date = 15 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/589384-choplifter-crisis-shield/data|title = ChopLifter: Crisis Shield Release Information for PlayStation 2 - GameFAQs}}</ref>

[[inXile Entertainment]] released ''[[Choplifter HD]]'' for [[Xbox Live Arcade]], [[PlayStation Network]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] in January 2012, and [[Ouya]] in August 2013.
