== Gameplay ==
Gameplay consists of a side-scrolling world covered in 24 different kinds of crystalline flowers resembling [[Selenite (mineral)#Gypsum flower|gypsum flowers]]. The player controls an [[embryo]]nic animal as it grows, survives and reproduces through 20 generations. Difficulty is introduced through the lack of instructions in the game. As such, the player must employ trial and error techniques to determine which flowers are edible, which flowers shrink or grow when stung, and which flowers are fatal or explosive when touched.<ref>[http://www.atariage.com/box_page.html?SoftwareID=3870&BoxStyleID=76 ''Alien Garden'' Owners Manual]. AtariAge entry. Retrieved 10 November 2008.</ref> The player may use either the organism's tail, stinger, or wings to bump or otherwise make contact with them. To maintain the challenge, the behavior of the flowers changes every time the game is played. To increase the challenge, the score is repeated all along the left and right sides of the scrolling screen. As the score increases, the animal avatar is forced to travel more and more closely to the sometimes deadly crystal flowers.

== Development ==
''Alien Garden'' was designed by [[Bernie De Koven]] and programmed by [[Jaron Lanier]] and Robert Leyland for the [[Epyx]] brand of publisher Automated Simulations. This was one of De Koven's first works alongside ''Ricochet''. He described designing these games as "like writing [[poetry]]" and recalled was "very free as there were so few established precedents" despite a 4 [[kilobyte|KB]] memory restriction.<ref name="AJOP">{{cite magazine | author=''American Journal of Play'' staff | date=Winter 2015 | title=Deep Fun and the Theater of Games: An Interview with Bernie DeKoven | url=https://archive.org/details/ERIC_EJ1053426/page/n13/mode/1up | magazine=[[American Journal of Play]] | publisher=[[The Strong]] | issn=1938-0399 | oclc=226081597 | volume=7 | issue=2 | page=150}}</ref> He said that ''Alien Garden'' allowed him to challenge his own preconceptions of what a game should be. He used it as an example of his newfound freedom of expression in design, calling it "kind of like a trip, like some kind of [[psychedelic experience]] just to sit there with my eyes closed and imagine all these interactions taking place on the screen."<ref name="HMP">{{cite web | author=[[Jesper Juul (game researcher)|Juul, Jesper]] | date=August 22, 2017 | title=Interview with Bernie DeKoven | url=https://www.jesperjuul.net/handmadepixels/interviews/dekoven.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201209080707/https://www.jesperjuul.net/handmadepixels/interviews/dekoven.html | archive-date=December 9, 2020 | publisher=Jesper Juul | accessdate=March 10, 2024}}</ref>

De Koven desired for ''Alien Garden'' to be an alternative to the perilous, alien environments found in other many games of its time. "I wanted to make an alien world, but not one that was necessarily hostile," he said. "A world that had some danger, but also some beauty."<ref name="EFWCAG">{{cite magazine | author=Wiswell, Phil | date=June 1983 | title=Phil Wiswell's Gamemakers: The learning game | url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_08_1983-06_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/page/n77/mode/2up | magazine=[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]] | publisher=Fun & Games Publishing | volume=1 | issue=8 | issn=0746-0546 | oclc=10488752 | pages=78–9}}</ref> He later characterized ''Alien Garden'' as "a kind of [[art game]], one that was beautiful to look at but required exploration to understand how to interact with the <nowiki>'</nowiki>flowers<nowiki>'</nowiki> in the garden."<ref name="AJOP"/> De Koven and Lanier worked together to define the [[computer graphics|graphical]] elements due to the memory limitations. The [[score (game)|score]] on the play field's boundary was designed to take up more of the screen as the game progressed, increasing the challenge for the player.<ref name="HMP"/>

== Reception ==
''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' praised the game for its "graphically stunning" visuals as well as the experimentation and strategy required.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Wiswell|first=Phil|date=May 1983|title=Alien Garden|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_07_1983-05_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/page/n63|magazine=[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]|volume=1|issue=7|page=66}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', however, harshly criticized the graphics, and felt that the lack of color was "particularly disappointing".<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Doum|first=Allen|date=March–April 1983|title=The Atari Arena|url=https://archive.org/details/cgw_9/page/n21|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|volume=3|issue=2|pages=20, 22}}</ref>
