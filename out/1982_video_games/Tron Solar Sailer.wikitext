'''''TRON: Solar Sailer''''' is a game that was released by [[Mattel]] for [[Intellivision]] in 1982. The game is one of four released for the console that required the [[Intellivoice]] module (the other three were ''[[Space Spartans]]'', [[B-17 Bomber (game)|''B-17 Bomber'']] and [[Bomb Squad (game)|''Bomb Squad'']]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

==Gameplay==
The game begins by giving the player a code. The player then progresses to a grid-like area with spiders and tanks, which hinder the player with melee and ranged attacks. Although enemies may be fired upon, doing so quickly drains the player's energy. Therefore, avoiding contact and dodging shots is often the most efficient way of navigating the grid. After reaching the correct sector, the player may enter the code to move on.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}
