==Gameplay==
''Championship Golf'' is a golf game which presents the course using both an overhead view and a side view.<ref name="CGW11"/>

==Reception==
Stanley Greenlaw reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The side view adds a degree of interest as you watch your ball fly into the air, down the fairway, and bounce to its stopping point. Unfortunately the game does not capitalize on this feature."<ref name="CGW11">{{cite magazine |last=Greenlaw |first=Stanley |title=Computer Golf! |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Julâ€“Aug 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=30}}</ref>
