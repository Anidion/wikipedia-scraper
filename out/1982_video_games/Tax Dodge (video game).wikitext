'''''Tax Dodge''''' is a [[maze video game]] for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] published by Island Graphics in 1982.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAF-DwAAQBAJ&q=%22island+graphics%22+%22tax+dodge%22&pg=PT222|title=High Score! Expanded: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games 3rd Edition|isbn=9780429771392|last1=Demaria|first1=Rusel|date=7 December 2018}}</ref> It is the first game created by [[Free Fall Associates]], a developer best known for ''[[Archon: The Light and the Dark]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Tax Dodge'' is a game in which the player navigates a maze collecting the stacks of coins.<ref name="CGW8"/> Having accumulated money, the player then tries to keep as much of it as possible out of the hands of four tax agents who are in constant pursuit.

==Development==
When asked about the genesis of the concept, designer [[Jon_Freeman (game designer)|Jon Freeman]] replied:{{Quote|we wanted to create a few maze games that weren't ''[[Pac-Man]]'' clones. The subject matter came from spending too much time doing our taxes, and the details were there partly to illustrate the absurdities of the [[Income tax in the United States|tax code]]. The layout was designed to combine the Atari 800's scrolling capabilities with the feel of a board game.<ref name="halcyon">{{cite book |title=Halcyon Days: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Game Programmers |date=1997 |publisher=dadgum.com |url=https://dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/FREEFALL.HTM}}</ref>}}

==Reception==
Allen Doum reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "As a game, ''Tax Dodge'' starts easy but becomes quite difficult starting with the fourth year. From there on out, players are going to have to work out patterns and, tricks to stay in the game. My only real complaint is that it seems much harder to 'corner' in this game than in most games — even with practice. ''Tax Dodge'' is a good, solid game that makes the most of {{sic|its'}} theme and somewhat overdone play mechanics."<ref name="CGW8">{{cite magazine |last=Doum |first=Allen |title=The Atari Arena |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Jan–Feb 1983 |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=34–35}}</ref>

Jon Freeman, of Free Fall Associates, said that the game appealed to adults, "but the average young gamer just didn't get it."<ref name=halcyon/>
