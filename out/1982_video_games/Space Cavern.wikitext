'''''Space Cavern''''' is a 1982 [[fixed shooter]] video game for the [[Atari 2600]] developed and released by [[Games by Apollo]]. Players control a spaceship commander who has landed on a planet and must defend the ship against its hostile creatures. Games by Apollo founder Pat Roper was impressed by the game ''[[Demon Attack]]'' and tasked Apollo member Dan Oliver with making a game very similar to it.

==Gameplay==

In ''Space Cavern'', players control the commander of an intergalactic spaceship that is traveling through a previously unknown area in space. The spaceship lands on a mysterious planet inhabited by creatures known as Electrosauri and Marsupods, who attempt to attack the crew of the ship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Space Cavern – Game Instructions|url=https://archive.org/stream/Space_Cavern_1981_Apollo#page/n1/mode/2up|publisher=[[Games by Apollo]]|pages=3–5|date=August 25, 1982|access-date=July 1, 2014}}</ref>

The [[player character]] is situated at the bottom of the screen. Leftward and rightward movements of the joystick correspond to leftward and rightward movements of the character. Moving the joystick upward and downward induces the character to fire left and right respectively. Pressing the controller button results in the character firing upward. The player must shoot enemy creatures that come from the top and bottom before they shoot the player character. Enemy creatures fire beams that cause the player to lose a [[Health (gaming)|life]] whenever contact is made with the character. An [[extra life]] is awarded every 2,000 points;<ref name=rovi>{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Michael|last2=Dykman|first2=Joan|title=Space Cavern – Overview|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=8352&tab=overview|website=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=February 18, 2003|access-date=July 1, 2014|archive-date=November 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116104418/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=8352&tab=overview|url-status=dead}}</ref> points are earned by destroying enemies, with 115 or 165 points awarded for killing an Electrosaurus and 200 points for a Marsupod.<ref name=conquer>{{cite web|title=Conquering: Space Cavern|url=https://archive.org/stream/Videogaming_Illustrated_1982-10_Ion_International_US#page/n25/mode/1up|website=[[Videogaming Illustrated]]|publisher=Ion International|access-date=July 13, 2014|date=October 1982|pages=25–26|issn=0739-4373}}</ref>

There are twenty-four gameplay variations included in ''Space Cavern''; all are playable by one or two players and activated by modifying the 2600's difficulty switches. The variations differ in the number of enemies, their speed, the direction of their lasers,<ref name=rovi/> and the inclusion of Marsupods.<ref name=conquer/>

==Development==
Company founder Pat Roper had flown programmer Ed Salvo to a [[Consumer Electronics Show]] to show him the [[Imagic]] video game ''[[Demon Attack]]''. Impressed with Imagic's game, Roper decided he wanted to produce one similar to it. He told developer Dan Oliver what he wanted in the game without disclosing his inspiration.<ref name=DP/> ''Space Cavern'' was released in 1982. Game publisher Panda rereleased an identical version of ''Space Cavern'' under the name ''Space Canyon'' the following year,<ref name="Weiss2012">{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Brett|title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&pg=PA108|date=March 7, 2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=978-0-7864-8755-4|page=108}}</ref> and an [[Atari 5200]] [[Porting#Porting in gaming|port]] was started but not completed.<ref name=DP>{{cite web|last1=Stilphen|first1=Scott|title=DP Interviews...

As development neared completion, mounting financial pressures came to a head and Games by Apollo found itself owing nearly $5 million, half of which debt belonged to its advertising agency [[Benton & Bowles]]. Games by Apollo faced growing pressure from Benton & Bowles to repay its debts, and a few months after ''Space Cavern''{{'s}} release, on November 12, 1982, Games by Apollo filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]]. Although Roper expected Apollo to "return in smaller form",<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Vid Game Firm Apollo Files Chapter XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WiQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT62|access-date=June 30, 2014|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=December 4, 1982|volume=94|number=48|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> the company closed in 1983 after reorganization attempts failed.<ref>{{cite web|title=AGH – Third Party Profile: Apollo|url=http://www.atarihq.com/2678/3party/apollo.html|website=Atari Gaming Headquarters|access-date=June 30, 2014|date=January 23, 2005}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Arcade Express'' magazine was positive about ''Space Cavern'', praising the graphics of the player's death, while criticizing the design of the enemies, and concluding by opining that the game was more suited to skilled players.<ref name=AE>{{cite web|title=Space Cavern|url=https://archive.org/stream/arcade_express_v1n2#page/n5/mode/2up|website=Arcade Express|publisher=Reese Publishing Company|access-date=July 1, 2014|date=August 30, 1982|volume=1|number=2}}</ref> In a review for ''Video'' magazine, [[Bill Kunkel (gaming)|Bill Kunkel]] and Arnie Katz did not agree whether ''Space Cavern''{{'s}} control scheme was unnaturally "cumbersome" or "an exciting departure from the expected". They wrote that the controls were "at least a little controversial" among arcade players.<ref name=kunkel8209AA>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= September 1982 |title= Arcade Alley: Star Wars and Space Caverns |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 6|pages= 30 and 106 |issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|30}} In a follow-up review for ''[[Electronic Games]]'', Kunkel and Katz concluded that the game would entertain arcade players hundreds of times over<ref name=kunkel8210EG>{{cite web|last1=Kunkel|first1=Bill|last2=Katz|first2=Arnie|title=Face the Terrors of the Alien Cave!|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-10/Electronic_Games_Issue_08_Vol_01_08_1982_Oct#page/n59/mode/1up/search/%22space+cavern%22|website=[[Electronic Games]]|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|access-date=July 14, 2014|date=October 1982|volume=1|number=8}}</ref>{{rp|60}} but criticized the graphics of the enemies.<ref name=kunkel8210EG/>{{rp|62}}

''TV Gamer''{{'s}} called the game too simple and not requiring much brainpower.<ref>{{cite web|title=Space Cavern|url=https://archive.org/stream/TV_Gamer_1983-06_Boytonbrook_GB#page/n31/mode/2up|website=TV Gamer|publisher=Boytonbrook|access-date=July 1, 2014|date=June 1983|page=32}}</ref> ''[[Videogaming Illustrated]]'' compared the game positively to ''[[Phoenix (1980 video game)|Phoenix]]'', and believed that it was "arguably the best space game on the market". The writer called it Apollo's best game and noted its suitability for both young and experienced players.<ref name=conquer/>

''Space Cavern'' was an [[honorable mention]] in the "Best Action Video Game" category at the 1983 [[Arkie Awards]].<ref name=kunkel8302AA>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= February 1983 |title= Arcade Alley: The Fourth Annual Arcade Awards |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 11|pages= 30, 108|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|108}}
