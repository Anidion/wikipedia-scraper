From the game's manual:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lake |first1=Steven |title=Journey Escape for the Atari 2600 |url=https://www.journey-tribute.com/journey/resources/atari2600/ |website=journey-tribute.com |access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref>

:''You're on the road with Journey, one of the world's hottest rock groups. A spectacular performance has just ended. Now it's up to you to guide each Journey Band Member past hordes of Love-Crazed Groupies, Sneaky Photographers, and Shifty-Eyed Promoters to the safety of the Journey Escape Vehicle in time to make the next concert. Your mighty manager and loyal roadies are there to help, but the escape is up to you!''

==Gameplay==

The player must lead the band members to their "[[Scarabaeus sacer|Scarab]] Escape Vehicle" (as featured on the cover) and protect the concert cash from "love-crazed" groupies, sneaky photographers, stage barriers and "shifty-eyed" promoters.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robbins |first1=Michael |title=Journey Dorce : The Record : NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/06/20/533551342/journey-force |publisher=NPR |access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Haider |first=Arwa |title=Joystick division! 10 bizarre band video games |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/9729c11b-b9e2-4326-be09-c8464d355de8 |website=bbc.co.uk |date=18 August 2017 |publisher=BBC Music |access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref> Assisting the player are roadies, which provide short periods of immunity to obstacles, and The Manager, depicted as the [[Kool-Aid Man]], which allows the player to move to the Scarab completely unhindered.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=JC |title=Virtually Overlooked: Journey Escape |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007-06-21-virtually-overlooked-journey-escape.html |website=Engadget |access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref> The screen scrolls vertically non-stop, although the speed can be controlled; the player moves side to side to dodge the aforementioned obstacles.<ref>{{cite web |title=AtariAge - Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Journey Escape (Data Age) |url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=252 |publisher=Atari Age |access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref>

==Music==
The intro tune is an excerpt from "[[Don't Stop Believin']]," which is on the ''Escape'' album. The in-game music, however, appears to be an original tune, rather than based on a Journey song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wallace |first1=Adam |title=Journey Escape Review for Atari 2600 (1982) |url=http://www.defunctgames.com/review/1180/journey-escape |publisher=Defunct Games |access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref>
