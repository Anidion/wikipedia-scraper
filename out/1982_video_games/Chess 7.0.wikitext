==Reception==
David Long reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Odesta's Chess 7.0'' probably has the most powerful chess solitaire play capability now available for home computers. You will find it extremely entertaining even if chess is not your favorite game. I hope that more designers will try to reach this level of solitaire capability in other types of computer games."<ref name="CGW10">{{cite magazine |last=Long |first=David |title=Chess 7.0: Review & Analysis |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Mayâ€“Jun 1983 |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=33, 42}}</ref>
