'''''Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress''''', released on August 24, 1982, for the [[Apple II]] ([[United States Copyright Office|USCO]]# PA-317-502), is the second [[role-playing video game]] in the ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' series, and the second installment in Ultima's "Age of Darkness" trilogy.

It is also the only official ''Ultima'' game published by [[Sierra On-Line]]. Conflict with Sierra over royalties for the IBM [[porting|port]] of this game led the series creator [[Richard Garriott]] to start his own company, [[Origin Systems]].<ref>''The Official Book of Ultima'' (second edition), page 25.</ref>

The plot of ''Ultima II'' revolves around the evil enchantress Minax, taking over the world and exacting revenge on the [[Player character|player]] for the player's defeat of [[Mondain]] in ''[[Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness|Ultima]]''. The player travels through time to acquire the means to defeat Minax and restore the world to peace. ''Ultima II'' has a larger game world than ''Ultima I'', and hosts advances in graphics and in gameplay.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Ultima2.jpg|thumb|left|The main overhead view. The player is on the [[Italian Peninsula]] on Earth in the year 1423 BC. A town is to the west.]]

The gameplay is very similar to the previous game in the series, ''[[Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness]]''. The scope of the game is bigger, in that there are several more places to explore, even though some of them (like most of the [[Solar System]] planets and the dungeons and towers) are not required to complete the game.

In the game, the player has to travel to several different time periods of Earth, using time doors. The periods are the Time of Legends (a mythological period), [[Pangea]] (about 300 to 250 million years ago), B.C. (1423, "before the dawn of civilization"), A.D. (1990), and the Aftermath (after 2112).<ref name="u2manual" /> The player also has to travel to space, where all the planets in the Solar System can be visited.<ref name="u2manual" />

==Plot==
From the game's story, the player learns that the lover of the dark [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] [[Mondain]], the [[Magician (paranormal)|enchantress]] [[Minax (Ultima)|Minax]], is threatening Earth through disturbances in the [[space-time]] continuum. The player must guide a hero [[Time travel in fiction|through time]] and the Solar System to defeat her evil plot.

The young Minax survived her mentor's and lover's death at the hands of the [[Avatar (Ultima)|Stranger]] (in ''[[Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness]]'') and went into hiding. Several years later, Minax got older and very powerful, more so than Mondain once was.<ref name="u2manual">{{cite book | publisher=Sierra On-Line | year=1982 | title=Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress Manual}}</ref><ref name="u4manual">{{cite book | publisher=[[Origin Systems]] | year=1985 | title=Ultima IV: Quest for the Avatar Manual: The History of Britannia}}</ref> Minax wanted to avenge the death of her lover, so she used the time doors created by Mondain's defeat to travel to the Time of Legends, a place located at the origin of times.<ref name="u2manual" /> From there, she sent her evil minions to all the different time eras; she also used her dark powers to disturb the fabric of time and influence men, who ultimately destroyed each other in the far future, nearly wiping out humanity.<ref name="u2manual" />

[[Lord British]] called for a hero to crush Minax's evil plans. The Stranger once again answered British's call.<ref name="u2manual" /> The game begins with the Stranger starting his quest to defeat Minax. Minax's castle, named Shadow Guard, can only be reached through time doors (similar to moongates in the later games); even then an enchanted ring is required to pass unhurt through the [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]] inside. The hero hunts down the sorceress to the Time of Legends, pursues her as she [[Teleportation in fiction|teleports]] throughout the castle, and destroys her with the quicksword Enilno.

Even though ''Ultima I'' is set on the fictional land of Sosaria, ''Ultima II'' borrowed characters and the story of ''Ultima I'', but relocated them to Earth. Garriott explained from a narrative perspective, Earth needed to be used as a basis for comparison due to the time travel element.<ref>''The Official Book of Ultima'', page 20.</ref> Later games in the ''Ultima'' series [[Retroactive continuity|ret-conned]] this, and assumed that ''Ultima II'' actually happened on Sosaria,<ref name="u4manual"/> not Earth, to create a continuity among the games.

==Development==
''Ultima II'' was Garriott's first program that he wrote completely in [[assembly language]]<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Lord British Kisses and Tells All / as told by His Royal Highness, High King of Britannia | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=July 1988 | author=Garriott, Richard | pages=28}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Ultima IX: Ascension |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=39 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=March 1998|page=63}}</ref> instead of interpreted [[BASIC]]. Playing speed and reaction time were vastly improved over the original release of ''Ultima I''.  Since Garriott was attending the [[University of Texas]] at the time it took him almost two years to create ''Ultima II'',<ref>''The Official Book of Ultima'', page 23.</ref> including learning assembly in one month from Tom Luhrs, the author of the popular Apple II arcade game ''[[Apple-Oids]]''.<ref name=maher20121011>{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2012/10/the-wizardry-and-ultima-sequels/ | title=The Wizardry and Ultima Sequels | work=The Digital Antiquarian | date=October 11, 2012 | access-date=July 10, 2014 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref>

''Ultima II'' was the first game in the series to include a cloth map inside the box, which would become a staple of the franchise. This map, which illustrated how the time doors were linked, was inspired by the one seen in the film ''[[Time Bandits]]'', as were the time doors themselves.<ref>''The Official Book of Ultima'', page 17.</ref> [[California Pacific Computer]], which published Garriott's first two games, had financial difficulties and did not pay full royalties; when other publishers approached him Garriott insisted on including the map. [[Sierra On-Line]] agreed and provided Garriott, who had left the university, with technical assistance as he developed his first major assembly language project.{{r|maher20121011}} Two versions of this map were produced. The first version is of a heavier and thicker material.  This map can be found in the large boxed (8"x11") [[Apple II]] and [[Atari 8-bit]] versions of the game. Later production runs of the game featured a much smaller box and a lighter weight map.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Despite reservations of Richard Garriott and [[Chuck Bueche]], the original Apple II version of the game was [[copy protection|copy-protected]] using Sierra's new [[Spiradisc]] system.<ref name="Levy">{{cite book |last1=Levy |first1=Steven |title=Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/hackersheroescom00levy_989 |url-access=limited |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hackersheroescom00levy_989/page/n343 326]–332 |chapter=Chapter 19: Applefest |year=2010 |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |isbn=978-1449388393|edition=25th Anniversary }}</ref>

The original Apple ''Ultima II'' received an audiovisual upgrade in 1989, bringing its graphics up to date with more recent games in the series much as was done with ''Ultima I''.  This "enhanced" version was only available as part of the ''Ultima Trilogy I-II-III'' box set released that year and discontinued only months later. (The Commodore and IBM versions of the ''Ultima Trilogy'' include the original, unenhanced versions of the game for their respective platforms.)

The game was re-released several times later in [[CD-ROM]] PC compilations, including 1998's ''Ultima Collection''. All these re-releases are missing necessary map files for most planets other than Earth; however, the map for "Planet X" is intact and the game is still winnable.  Modern (too fast) computers also generate a [[divide by zero error]] when attempting to run the game. These issues are addressed with [[fan patch]]es created by Voyager Dragon, a fan of the series, and are available on his website ''The Exodus Project''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Michael C. Maggio |url=http://exodus.voyd.net/ultima2.html |title=The Exodus Project – Projects – Ultima II |publisher=Exodus.voyd.net |access-date=November 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503175443/http://exodus.voyd.net/ultima2.html |archive-date=May 3, 2013 }}</ref> The game is known to run without errors and at an acceptable speed in a [[DOSBox]] environment, provided the missing map files are present.

''Ultima II'' was the first game in the series officially ported to platforms other than the Apple II.

==Ports==
===Atari 8-bit computers===
The Atari 8-bit version was released in late 1983, several months after the Apple original. The game is mostly a direct port from the Apple II using the computer's high resolution graphics (which works in a similar manner to the Apple II's HGR mode) but does not otherwise take advantage of the Atari's advanced features.

===Commodore 64===
The C64 port was apparently released before the programmer (credited only as "Bobbit") could finish.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} As a consequence, it is missing some gameplay elements{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} and also has a simplified title screen with text characters instead of the dragon graphic on other versions.

===IBM PC compatibles===
The IBM PC version of ''Ultima II'' runs under MS-DOS compatible operating systems and  supports only the [[Color Graphics Adapter]] and [[PC speaker]] sound. It  uses the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] for timing, and it will run too fast on anything except an [[Intel 8088|8088]]. It is  prone to generating divide by zero errors and [[Crash (computing)|crashing]]. The original contract between Garriott and Sierra On-Line didn't include an IBM PC edition, because Garriott considered this system "cumbersome, expensive and underpowered"; he later was disappointed by the contract terms for this port and started thinking about starting his own company.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Contato|first=Andrea|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1255404454|title=Through the Moongate : the story of Richard Garriott, Origin Systems Inc. and Ultima|date=2020–2021|publisher=Independently Published |isbn=978-1-0710-0685-6|edition=2nd|location=|language=English|oclc=1255404454}}</ref>

===Macintosh===
In May 1985,<ref name="CE1985">{{cite magazine |title=1985 Index |magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]] |date=January 1986 |volume=4 |issue=10 |page=6 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/newsletters/video_game_update/computer_entertainer_jan86.pdf#page=6}}</ref> Sierra released a port of ''Ultima II'' for the [[Macintosh 128K]]/[[Macintosh 512K|512K]]. Along with ''Ultima III'', this would be the only of the classic ''Ultima'' games available for the Macintosh family. The game is compatible with Mac OS versions up to System 6 and will run on System 7.5 with a patch.

===Atari ST===
The Atari ST port was one of the earliest commercially released games for the system, coming out shortly after the computer's June 1985 launch. It uses mostly simple block graphics with little enhancement for the ST's hardware capabilities and runs from within TOS, not a self-booting disk as most Atari ST games do.

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' in 1983 stated that ''Ultima II'' "continues the interplanetary saga with a creative programming flair far beyond the scope of most fantasy or adventure games". The magazine concluded that "Lord British has another, greater hit on his hands ... the ultimate in real-time D&D type fantasy games for the micro".<ref name="shore198301">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=6&id=9 | title=Ultima II | work=Softline | date=January 1983 | access-date=July 27, 2014 | author=Shore, Howard A. | pages=40}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1983 gave ''Ultima II'' a positive review, noting many improvements over its predecessor, particularly in the amount of detail. The magazine praised the large size of the game world, even though little of it is necessary to complete the game, suggesting that additional scenarios would be added leading up to an "Ultimate" quest.<ref>{{Cite news | date = March–April 1983 | last = McPherson | first = James | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Ultima II: A Review  | pages = 23, 45 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&pub=2&id=9 }}</ref> In 1991 and 1993 the magazine's [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] called it "a good sequel to the original game".<ref name="scorpia199110">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 | title=C*R*P*G*S / Computer Role-Playing Game Survey | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1991 | access-date=November 18, 2013 | author=Scorpia | pages=16}}</ref><ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | access-date=March 25, 2016 | author=Scorpia | pages=34–50}}</ref> ''K-Power'' gave the game 7 points out of 10. The magazine described it as "an animated [[graphic adventure game]]" and stated that ''Ultima II'' "is more sophisticated and has a quicker pace" than its predecessor, with a "fascinating" world. It concluded that the game was "unique and its storyline is original".<ref name="langendoen198402">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/k-power-magazine-01/K-Power_Issue_01_1984_Feb#page/n59/mode/2up/search/zork | title=Ultima III | work=K-Power | date=February 1984 | access-date=January 16, 2015 | author=Langendoen, David | pages=59}}</ref> ''[[PC Magazine]]'' gave ''Ultima II'' 15.5 points out of 18, also praising the game's "great big wonderful world".<ref name="wiswell19840821">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jeH7OGPwUUC&pg=PA271 | title=Ultimate Sorcery | work=[[PC Magazine]] | date=August 21, 1984 | access-date=October 25, 2013 | author=Wiswell, Phil | pages=271}}</ref>
