'''''The Amazing Adventures of Mr. F. Lea''''', often shortened to '''''Mr. F. Lea''''', is an [[arcade game]] released by [[Pacific Novelty]] in 1982. It is a collection of four canine-themed mini-games that borrow gameplay elements from ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', ''[[Frogger]]'', and ''[[Jungle Hunt]]'', and a fourth game where Mr. F. Lea runs up a dog's back, jumping over spots and bursting [[balloon]]s.
