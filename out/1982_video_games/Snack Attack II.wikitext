==Reception==
Richard Cook for ''[[PC World]]'' said "''Snack Attack II'' is a simple but polished program; no problems interfere with serious gumdrop gobbling. This game's improvements over ''Pac Man'' – the speedup of the mouth after it gobbles an apple, the safety boxes, the skill levels, and the different mazes – give it an edge over its famous predecessor."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/pcworld15unse/page/134/mode/2up|title=PC World|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Will Fastie for ''[[Creative Computing]]'' said "as far as I'm concerned, it's the best arcade-style game currently available for the IBM PC. The game is ''Snack Attack II''. It's a Pac-Man clone. It's addictive and tough. It's well-built. It's fun."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/CreativeComputingbetterScan198302/page/n279/mode/2up|title=Creative Computing (better Scan) 1983 02|date=February 1, 1983|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Corey Sandler for ''[[PC Magazine]]'' said "''Snack Attack II'' looks like, sounds like, plays like – and if you really want to anthropomorphize its hero – ''tastes'' like old friend Pac-Man. Only it's been subtly improved."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/PC-Mag-1983-02/page/n205/mode/2up|title=PC Mag 1983-02|date=February 4, 1983|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
