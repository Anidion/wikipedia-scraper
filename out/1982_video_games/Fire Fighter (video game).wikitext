'''''Fire Fighter''''' is a video game written by Brad Stewart for the [[Atari 2600]] published by [[Imagic]] in 1982.<ref name=mania/> The player uses fire fighting equipment in an attempt to extinguish the fire in a tall building and rescue the occupants.

==Gameplay==

The player moves a fire fighter around a non-scrolling screen to spray water on fires in a building, the size of which may vary between levels depending on options selected by the player, before a person trapped in the building is killed by the fire. Once the fire is out the player can extend a ladder from a [[fire truck]] to rescue the person from the building.

The game may be played in single-player mode, or in a two-player mode where each player takes turns.<ref name="Classic Home Video Games" />

==Reception==
The contemporary reception to the game was broadly positive. ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' praised it, saying "''Fire Fighter'' strikes a positive note by having the player save people and property rather than destroy them".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Atari 2600 Games |journal=Good Housekeeping |date=1983 |volume=197 |page=768 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jxYyAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Fire+Fighter%22+%22Atari+2600%22 |accessdate=28 August 2019}}</ref> German magazine ''TeleMatch'' gave it 4/6, praising particularly its action and gameplay.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fire Fighter |journal=TeleMatch |date=February–March 1983 |issue=2 |pages=18–19 |url=https://archive.org/details/TeleMatch.N02.1983.02-KCz.pdf/page/n17 |accessdate=28 August 2019}}</ref> ''TV Gamer'' magazine described it as "a pleasant game that is moderately challenging" though they also noted that "the novelty may soon wear off and boredom could set in".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fire Fighter |journal=TV Gamer |date=Autumn 1983 |page=25 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/magazines/tv_gamer/tv_gamer_autumn83.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2019}}</ref> ''Viedogaming Illustrated'' described the game as "not so much fun as an exercise in stubborn, methodical perseverance".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Towering Inferno |journal=Videogaming Illustrated |date=February 1983 |page=62 |url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_Illustrated_1983-02_Ion_International_US/page/n61 |accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref> The 1983 ''Book of Atari Software'' assessed the game as a C+ overall, praising the graphics and the sound but criticising the replayability of the game.<ref name="Stanton et al">{{cite book |last1=Stanton |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Wells |first2=Robert P. |last3=Rochowansky |first3=Sandra |title=The Book of Atari Software 1983 |date=1983 |publisher=The Book Company |issn=0736-2706 |page=328 |url=https://archive.org/details/ataribooks-the-book-of-atari-software-1983/page/n329/mode/2up?q=baseball |access-date=20 February 2021}}</ref>

Retrospective reviewers have been less positive about ''Fire Fighter''. In ''Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984: A Complete Reference Guide'', Brett Weiss noted that the game "has no real sense of danger" and can be "repetitious and incredibly dull", and summarises it as "arguably the weakest title in the Imagic library".<ref name="Classic Home Video Games" /> In their review, [[Classic Game Room]] described the game as not being at the same level as Imagic's own ''[[Demon Attack]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Classic Game Room - FIRE FIGHTER Atari 2600 review |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9pp_itw640 |website=Youtube | date=14 October 2011 |publisher=CGR Publishing |accessdate=28 August 2019}}</ref>
