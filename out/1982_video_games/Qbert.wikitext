'''''Q*bert''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|juː|b|ər|t}}) is an [[arcade video game]] developed and published for the North American market by [[Gottlieb]] in 1982. It is a [[Video game graphics|2D]] [[action game]] with [[Puzzle video game|puzzle elements]] that uses [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric graphics]] to create a [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] effect. The objective of each level in the game is to change every cube in a pyramid to a target color by making Q*bert, the on-screen character, hop on top of the cube while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Players use a [[joystick]] to control the character.

The game was conceived by Warren Davis and [[Jeff Lee (video game artist)|Jeff Lee]]. Lee designed the [[title character]] and original concept, which was further developed and implemented by Davis. ''Q*bert'' was developed under the project name ''Cubes''.<ref name="Retro54" />

''Q*bert'' was well-received in arcades and among critics. The game was Gottlieb's most successful video game and is among the most recognized brands from the [[golden age of arcade video games|golden age of arcade games]]. It has been [[Porting|ported]] to numerous [[Glossary of video game terms#P|platforms]]. The game's success resulted in [[#Updates, remakes, and sequels|sequels]] and the use of the character's likeness in [[merchandising]], such as appearances on lunch boxes, toys, and an animated television show. The Q*bert character became known for his "swearing" and "Q*bertese sound" – an incoherent phrase made of synthesized speech generated by [[Votrax#Third party|the sound chip]] and a speech balloon containing a [[grawlix]] that appears when he collides with an enemy.

Because the game was developed during the period when [[Columbia Pictures]] owned Gottlieb, the intellectual rights to ''Q*bert'' remained with Columbia, even after they divested themselves of Gottlieb's assets in 1984. Therefore, the rights have been owned by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] since its parent, [[Sony]], acquired Columbia in 1989. Q*bert appeared in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[Wreck-It Ralph (franchise)|''Wreck-It Ralph'' franchise]], under license from [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]], and later appeared in the film ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Q*bert'' is an [[action game]] with [[Puzzle video game|puzzle elements]] played from an [[Isometric video game graphics|axonometric]] third-person perspective to convey a three-dimensional look. The game is played using a single, diagonally mounted four-way joystick.<ref name="EF-Mar83" /> The player controls Q*bert, who starts each game at the top of a pyramid made of 28 cubes, and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next [[Level (video games)|stage]].<ref name="EG-May83" />

At the beginning, jumping on every cube once is enough to advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of remaining on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.<ref name="vidiot">{{cite magazine |date=April–May 1983 |title=Arcade Action Close-Up: Crazy For Q&bert's Cube |magazine=[[Vidiot]] |publisher=Creem Publications |pages=30–31 |url=https://archive.org/stream/vidiotmagazine_202003/Vidiot%2003%20%28Apr-May%201983%29%20The%20Beatles%20-%20The%20Fab%20Four%20on%20Tape%21#page/n29/mode/2up}}</ref>

An orange spherical character, a red ball, and a purple coiled snake are on the cubes. Multicolored discs are adjacent to the left and right sides of the pyramid. Above the pyramid are statistics related to gameplay.|Q*bert hops diagonally down the pyramid to avoid the purple snake, Coily.]]

The player is impeded by several enemies, introduced gradually to the game:
* '''Coily''' – Coily first appears as a purple egg that bounces to the bottom of the pyramid and then transforms into a snake that chases Q*bert. He is often considered the main antagonist and Q*bert's arch-nemesis. Q*bert will die if he collides with Coily.<ref name="EF-Mar83" />
* '''Ugg and Wrongway''' – Two purple creatures that hop along the sides of the cubes in an [[Relativity (M. C. Escher)|Escheresque]] manner. Starting at either the bottom left or bottom right corner, they keep moving toward the top right or top left side of the pyramid respectively and fall off the pyramid when they reach the end. Both are dangerous. Q*bert will also die if he collides with them.<ref name="EF-Mar83" />
* '''Slick and Sam''' – Two green creatures that descend down the pyramid and revert cubes whose color has already been changed. They do not hurt Q*bert, but are usually irritating to the player since they change the color of the cube to the original or former color.<ref name="vidiot" />

Contact with purple enemies results in a life lost, whereas the green ones are removed from the board upon contact.<ref name="EF-Mar83" /> Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball also results in a life lost, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time.<ref name="vidiot" /> Multicolored floating discs on either side of the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points.<ref name="EF-Mar83" /> This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.

Points are awarded for each color change (15 or 25), defeating Coily with a flying disc (500), remaining discs at the end of a stage (at higher stages, 50 or 100) and catching green balls (100) or Slick and Sam (300 each).<ref name="vidiot" /> Bonus points are also awarded for completing a screen, starting at 1,000 points on the first screen of Level 1 and increasing by 250 on each subsequent completion, up to 5,000 after Level 4. [[Life (video games)#Extra lives|Extra lives]] are granted for reaching certain scores, which are set by the machine operator.<ref name="CVG-Apr83">{{cite magazine |date=April 1983 |title='Q' Up for this One |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |publisher=[[EMAP]] |issue=18 |page=31 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/8/86/CVG_UK_018.pdf |access-date=2020-09-05 |archive-date=2021-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210730023633/https://retrocdn.net/images/8/86/CVG_UK_018.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Development==
[[File:Q*Bert concept sketch.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A concept sketch illustrating an earlier outline of the game. The pyramid and Q*bert's movement are already very similar to the final product, but it still shows a shooting mechanic, which was not implemented in the final game. It also shows a sole enemy type not in the final game, which differs only in its shading and orientation on the three visible sides of the cubes.|In this concept sketch, Q*bert is still depicted shooting his foes. The sole enemy type depicted appears to be Ugg or WrongWay, although some are positioned on top of the blocks instead of just the sides as they would appear in the final version.]]

===Concept===
[[File:Warren Davis by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|''Q*bert'' developer Warren Davis]]
Programmer Warren Davis wrote that he was inspired by a pattern of hexagons implemented by fellow Gottlieb developer and ''[[Mad Planets]]'' designer Kan Yabumoto.<ref name="coinop" />

In a different telling, the initial concept began when artist Jeff Lee drew a pyramid of cubes inspired by [[M. C. Escher]].<ref name="Ultimate-1">{{cite book| title=[[Ultimate History of Video Games]]| first=Steven| last=Kent | authorlink=Steven L. Kent| pages=222–224| chapter=The Fall| publisher=[[Three Rivers Press]]| isbn=0-7615-3643-4| year=2001}}</ref> Lee believed a game could be derived from the artwork, and created an orange, armless main character. The character jumped along the cubes and shot projectiles, called "mucus bombs", from a tubular nose at enemies.<ref name="VideoGames-Apr83" /> Enemies included a blue creature, later changed purple and named Wrong Way, and an orange creature, later changed green and named Sam.<ref name="Retro54">{{cite magazine |last=Wild |first=Kim |date=September 2008 |title=The Making of Q*bert |url=https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_054#page/70/mode/2up |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |issue=54 |pages=70–73}}</ref> Lee had drawn similar characters since childhood, inspired by characters from comics, cartoons, ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine and by artist [[Ed "Big Daddy" Roth]].<ref name="edge">{{cite magazine| title=The Making of Q*bert| author=Edge Staff| magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]| issue=132| pages=114–117| date=January 2003| url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/making-qbert| access-date=January 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503102958/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-qbert |archive-date=May 3, 2012}}</ref> Q*bert's design later included a [[speech balloon]] with [[wikt:grawlix|a string of nonsensical characters]], "{{nowrap|@!#?@!}}",<ref group="Note">The original artwork displays the first and fifth character as [[spiral]]s. The [[at sign]] ("@") is used in its place in the text of the references.</ref> which Lee originally presented as a joke.<ref name="Retro54" />

===Implementation===
Warren Davis, who was hired to work on the game ''Protector'',<ref name="Ultimate-1" /> noticed Lee's ideas and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as [[game mechanics]]. Thus, he added balls that bounce from the pyramid's top to bottom.<ref name="Retro54" /> Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also believed games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective of saving the protagonist from danger.<ref name="edge" /> As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them.<ref name="Ultimate-1" /><ref name="Retro54" /><ref name="edge" /> Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision.<ref name="Ultimate-1" /><ref name="Retro54" /> Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982,<ref name="coinop" /> but the project was only put on the schedule as an actual product several months later.<ref group="Note">Davis stated that this happened "by June or July", whereas Howie Rubin, vice president of Gottlieb, claimed in an early 1983 interview with Video Games that the game was not yet on a list of games voted for in a brainstorming session in August. {{cite magazine| magazine=[[Video Games]]| volume=1| publisher=Pumpkin Press| issue=8| pages=26–30| title=The Life and Times of Q*bert & Joust| first=Neil| last=Tesser| date=March 1983}}</ref>

A [[MOS Technology 6502]] chip that operates at 894&nbsp;kHz generates the sound effects, and a [[Speech synthesis|speech synthesizer]] by [[Votrax]] generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web| url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9182| title=Q*bert Videogame by Gottlieb (1982)| publisher=[[Killer List of Videogames]]| access-date=May 31, 2009| archive-date=February 12, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212121618/http://arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9182| url-status = live}}</ref> The audio system uses 128&nbsp;[[Byte|B]] of [[random-access memory|RAM]] and 4&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] of [[EPROM]] to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.<ref name="AudioAnecdotes">{{cite book| title=Audio Anecdotes: Tools, Tips, and Techniques for Digital Audio, Volume 1| editor1-first =Ken| editor1-last=Greenebaum| editor2-first=Ronen| editor2-last=Barzel| publisher=A K Peters, Ltd.| year=2004| isbn=1-56881-104-7| chapter=Retro Game Sound: What We Can Learn from 1980s Era Synthesis| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OPo-nEhjB9gC&pg=PA164| pages=164–165| access-date=2016-09-24| url-status=live| archive-date=2018-03-03| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303132711/https://books.google.com/books?id=OPo-nEhjB9gC&pg=PA164}}</ref>

Thiel was tasked with using the synthesizer to produce English phrases for the game. However, he was unable to create coherent phrases and eventually chose to string together random [[phoneme]]s instead. Thiel also believed the incoherent speech was a good fit for the "{{nowrap|@!#?@!}}" in Q*bert's speech balloon. Following a suggestion from technician Rick Tighe, a [[pinball]] machine component known as a ‘knocker’ was included to make a loud sound when a character falls off the pyramid.<ref name="Ultimate-1" /><ref name="Retro54" /> This knocker consists of a solenoid with a plunger that strikes the mounting bracket (which in turn is firmly fastened to the cabinet). Foam padding was added to the area of contact on the bracket; the developers decided the softer sound better matched a fall rather than a loud knocking sound. The cost of installing foam, however, was too expensive and the padding was omitted.<ref name="edge" />

===Title===
The Gottlieb staff had difficulty naming the game. Aside from the project name "''Cubes''", it was untitled for most of the development process. The staff agreed the game should be named after the main character, but disagreed on the name.<ref name="Retro54" /> Lee's title for the initial concept—''Snots And Boogers''—was rejected, as was a list of suggestions compiled from company employees.<ref name="Retro54" /><ref name="Fever">{{cite book| title = Arcade Fever: The Fan's Guide to The Golden Age of Video Games| first = John| last = Sellers| pages = 108–109| publisher = [[Running Press]]|date=August 2001| isbn = 0-7624-0937-1}}</ref> According to Davis, vice president of marketing Howie Rubin championed ''{{nowrap|@!#?@!}}'' as the title. Although staff members argued it was silly and would be impossible to pronounce, a few early test models were produced with ''{{nowrap|@!#?@!}}'' as the title on the units' artwork.<ref name="Retro54" /><ref name="Fever" /> During a meeting, "Hubert" was suggested, and a staff member thought of combining "Cubes" and "Hubert" into "Cubert".<ref name="Retro54" /><ref name="Fever" /> Art director Richard Tracy changed the name to "Q-bert", and the [[hyphen]] was later changed to an [[asterisk]]. In retrospect, Davis expressed regret for the asterisk, because it prevented the name from becoming a common [[crossword]] term and it is a [[wildcard character]] for [[Search engine (computing)|search engines]].<ref name="Retro54" />

===Testing===
As development neared the production stage, ''Q*bert'' underwent location tests in local [[Amusement arcade|arcades]] under its preliminary title ''{{nowrap|@!#?@!}}'', before being widely distributed. According to Jeff Lee, his oldest written record attesting to the game being playable as ''{{nowrap|@!#?@!}}'' in a public location, a Brunswick bowling alley, dates back to September 11, 1982.<ref name="Retro54" /> Gottlieb also conducted [[focus group]]s, in which the designers observed players through a [[one-way mirror]].<ref name="Retro54" /> The control scheme received a mixed reaction during playtesting; some players adapted quickly while others found it frustrating.<ref name="Retro54" /><ref name="edge" /> Initially, Davis was worried players would not adjust to the different controls; some players would unintentionally jump off the pyramid several times, reaching a [[game over]] in about ten&nbsp;seconds. Players, however, became accustomed to the controls after playing several rounds of the game.<ref name="Retro54" /> The different responses to the controls prompted Davis to reduce the game's level of difficulty, a decision that he would later regret.<ref name="edge" />
