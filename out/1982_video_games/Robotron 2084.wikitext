'''''Robotron: 2084''''' (also referred to as '''''Robotron''''') is a [[multidirectional shooter]] developed by [[Eugene Jarvis]] and [[Larry DeMar]] of [[Vid Kidz]] and released in arcades by [[WMS Industries|Williams Electronics]] in 1982. The game is set in the year 2084 in a fictional world where [[AI takeover|robots have turned against humans]] in a cybernetic revolt. The aim is to defeat endless waves of robots, rescue surviving humans, and earn as many points as possible.

Jarvis and DeMar drew inspiration from ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', ''[[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]'' and ''[[Space Invaders]]'' for the design of ''Robotron: 2084''. A two-joystick control scheme was implemented to provide the player with more precise controls, and enemies with different behaviors were added to make the game challenging. Jarvis and DeMar designed the game to instill panic in players by presenting them with conflicting goals and having on-screen projectiles coming from multiple directions.

''Robotron: 2084'' was critically and commercially successful. Praise among critics focused on the game's intense action and control scheme. Though not the first game with a twin joystick control scheme, ''Robotron: 2084'' is cited as the game that popularized it. It was ported to numerous home systems - most of which are hampered by the lack of two joysticks - Jarvis used the same control scheme in ''[[Smash TV]]'' (1990). The game is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the [[video game industry]].

== Gameplay ==

''Robotron'' is a 2D [[multidirectional shooter]] game in which the player controls the on-screen protagonist from a [[Video game graphics|top-down perspective]]. The game is set in the year 2084 in a fictional world where robots ("Robotrons") have taken control of the world and eradicated most of the human race. The main protagonist is called "Robotron Hero" who is a super-powered [[genetic engineering]] error (or mutant) and attempts to save the last human family.<ref name="Fever-1">{{cite book | title = Arcade Fever: The Fan's Guide to The Golden Age of Video Games | chapter = Robotron: 2084 | first = John | last = Sellers | pages = 110–111 | publisher = [[Running Press]] | date=August 2001 | isbn = 0-7624-0937-1}}</ref><ref name="KLOV">{{cite web | url = http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9347 | title = Robotron: 2084 Videogame by Williams (1982) | publisher = [[Killer List of Videogames]] | access-date = 2009-02-10}}</ref><ref name="allgame">{{cite web | url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=436&tab=overview | title = Robotron: 2084 - Overview - allgame | publisher = [[Allgame]] | first = Brad | last = Cook | access-date = 2009-02-10}}</ref>

The game uses a two-joystick control scheme; the left joystick controls the on-screen character's movement, while the right controls the direction the character's weapon fires. Both joysticks allow for an input direction in one of eight ways. Each [[Level (video games)|level]], referred to as a "wave", is a single screen populated with a large number of various enemy robots and obstacles; types range from invincible giants to robots that continually manufacture other robots that shoot the protagonist. Coming into contact with an enemy, projectile, or obstacle costs the player one life, but extra lives can be earned at certain point totals. Waves also include human family members who can be rescued to score additional points, but certain robots can either kill them or turn them into enemies. Destroying all vulnerable robots allows the player to progress to the next wave; the cycle continues until all lives are lost.<ref name="Fever-1" /><ref name="KLOV" /><ref name="allgame" />

''Robotron: 2084'' features [[Beat (acoustics)|monaural]] sound and [[raster graphics]] on a 19-inch [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor.<ref name="KLOV"/> It uses a [[Motorola 6809]] [[central processing unit]] that operates at 1M[[Hertz|Hz]].<ref name="Halcyon"/> Sounds are generated in software, with the same routines as in other Williams games of the era. The game uses a priority scheme to determine which sounds to play on a single channel.<ref name="gamesTM-36"/> A custom [[blitter]] chip generates the on-screen objects and visual effects. It transfers memory faster than the CPU, allowing the game to simultaneously animate a large number of objects.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref>{{cite book | title = Handbook of Computer Animation | first = John | last = Vince | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]] | page = 4 | isbn = 1-85233-564-5 | year = 2002}}</ref>

The game was developed in six months by [[Eugene Jarvis]] and [[Larry DeMar]], founders of [[Vid Kidz]].<ref name="Halcyon">{{cite book | title = Halcyon Days: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Games Programmers | editor = James Hague | year = 1997 | chapter = Eugene Jarvis | publisher = Dadgum Games | chapter-url = https://dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/JARVIS.HTM | title-link = Halcyon Days (book)}}</ref> Vid Kidz served as a consulting firm that designed games for Williams Electronics (part of [[WMS Industries]]), whom Jarvis and DeMar had previously worked for.<ref name="Ultimate-1">{{cite book | title = [[Ultimate History of Video Games]] | first = Steven | last = Kent | authorlink = Steven L.

''Robotron: 2084''{{'}}s gameplay is based on presenting the player with conflicting goals: avoid enemy attacks to survive, defeat enemies to progress, and save the family to earn points.<ref name="Fever-2">{{cite book | title = Arcade Fever: The Fan's Guide to The Golden Age of Video Games | chapter = The Creator | first = John | last = Sellers | pages = 52–53 | publisher = [[Running Press]] | date=August 2001 | isbn = 0-7624-0937-1}}</ref> It was first inspired by [[Stern (game company)|Stern]] Electronics' 1980 arcade game ''[[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]'' and the [[Commodore PET]] computer game ''Chase''. ''Berzerk'' is a shooting game in which a character traverses a maze to shoot robots, and ''Chase'' is a [[text-based game]] in which players move text [[Character encoding|characters]] into others.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-1">{{cite video game | title= [[Midway Arcade Treasures]] | developer= [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]] | publisher= [[Midway Games]] | date= 2003-11-18 | platform= [[PlayStation 2]] | level= The Inside Story On Robotron 2084}}</ref>

The initial concept involved a passive main character; the object was to get robots that chased the protagonist to collide with stationary, lethal obstacles.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="gamesTM-36">{{cite journal | journal = [[GamesTM]] | title = Robotron: 2084 Behind the Scenes | issue = 36 | date=October 2005 | author = GamesTM Staff | pages = 146–149}}</ref> The game was deemed too boring compared to other action titles on the market and shooting was added to provide more excitement.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="Retro60">{{cite journal | journal = [[Retro Gamer]] | title = The Making of Robotron: 2084 | first = Craig | last = Grannell | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]] | issue = 60 | date=March 2009 | pages = 44–47}}</ref> The shooting elements drew inspiration from 1978 arcade game ''[[Space Invaders]]'' (1978), which had previously inspired ''Defender''.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Grannell | first1=Craig | title=Eugene Jarvis on the reality of clones in the games industry | url=http://reverttosaved.com/2008/07/30/eugene-jarvis-on-the-reality-of-clones-in-the-games-industr/ | access-date=19 May 2021 | work=Revert to Saved | date=July 30, 2008}}</ref>

The dual-joystick design was developed by Jarvis, and resulted from two experiences in Jarvis's life: an [[Traffic collision|automobile accident]] and playing ''Berzerk''. Prior to beginning development, Jarvis injured his right hand in an accident—his hand was still in a cast when he returned to work, which prevented him from using a traditional joystick with a button. While in rehabilitation, he thought of ''Berzerk''.<ref name="Ultimate-1"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> Though Jarvis enjoyed the game and similar titles, he was dissatisfied with the control scheme; ''Berzerk'' used a single joystick to move the on-screen character and a button to fire the weapon, which would shoot the same direction the character was facing.<ref name="Ultimate-1"/><ref name="Retro60"/> Jarvis noticed that if the button was held down, the character would remain stationary and the joystick could be used to fire in any direction.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="Retro60"/> This method of play inspired Jarvis to add a second joystick dedicated to aiming the direction projectiles were shot.<ref name="Retro60"/> Jarvis and DeMar created a prototype using a ''[[Stargate (1981 video game)|Stargate]]'' [[arcade system board]] and two [[Atari 2600 hardware#Controllers|Atari 2600 controllers]] attached to a control panel.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="Ultimate-1"/> In retrospect, Jarvis considers the design a contradiction that blends "incredible freedom of movement" with ease of use.<ref name="gamesTM-36"/>

The developers felt a rescue theme similar to ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]''—one of their previous games—was needed to complete the game, and added a human family as a method to motivate players to earn a high score.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/><ref name="Retro60"/> The rescue aspect also created a situation where players had to constantly reevaluate their situation to choose the optimal action: run from enemies, shoot enemies, or rescue humans.<ref name="gamesTM-36"/><ref name="Fever-2"/> Inspired by [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', Jarvis and DeMar worked the concept of an [[Orwellian]] world developed into the plot. The two noticed, however, that 1984 was approaching, but the state of the real world did not match that of the book. They decided to set the game further in the future, the year 2084, to provide a more realistic timeframe for their version of "[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]". Jarvis, a [[science fiction]] fan, based the Robotrons on the idea that computers would eventually become advanced entities that helped humans in everyday life. He believed the robots would eventually realize that humans are the cause of the world's problems and revolt against them.<ref name="Ultimate-1"/>

Jarvis and DeMar [[playtest]]ed the game themselves, and continually tweaked the designs as the project progressed.<ref name="gamesTM-36"/> Though games at the time began to use [[scrolling]] to have larger levels, the developers chose a single screen to confine the action.<ref name="Retro60"/> To instill panic in the player, the character was initially placed in the center of the game's action, and had to deal with projectiles coming from multiple directions, as opposed to previous shooting games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Galaxian]]'', where the enemies attacked from a single direction. This made for more challenging gameplay, an aspect Jarvis took pride in.<ref name="Ultimate-1"/> Enemies were assigned to stages in different groups to create themes.<ref name="Halcyon"/> Early stages were designed to be relatively simple compared to later ones. The level of difficulty was designed to increase quickly so players would struggle to complete later stages. In retrospect, Jarvis attributes his and DeMar's average player skills to the game's balanced design. Though they made the game as difficult as they could, the high end of their skills ended up being a good challenge for expert players.<ref name="gamesTM-36"/> The graphics were given a simple appearance to avoid a cluttered game screen, and object designs were made distinct from each other to avoid confusion. Black was chosen as the background color to help characters stand out and reduce clutter.<ref name="Retro60"/>

=== Enemy designs ===
Each enemy was designed to exhibit a unique behavior toward the character; random elements were programmed into the enemies' behaviors to make the game more interesting.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="gamesTM-36"/> The first two designed were the simplest: Electrodes and Grunts. Electrodes are stationary objects that are lethal to the in-game characters, and Grunts are simple robots that chase the protagonist by plotting the shortest path to him.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="Retro60"/> Grunts were designed to overwhelm the player with large groups.<ref name="gamesTM-36"/> While testing the game with the new control system and the two enemies, Jarvis and DeMar were impressed by the gameplay's excitement and fun. As a result, they began steadily increasing the number of on-screen enemies to over a hundred to see if more enemies would generate more enjoyment.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="Retro60"/>

Other enemies were created to add more variety. Large, indestructible Hulks, inspired by an enemy in ''Berzerk'', were added to kill the humans on the stage. Though they cannot be destroyed, the developers decided to have the protagonist's projectiles slow the Hulk's movement as a way to help the player. Levitating Enforcers were added as enemies that could shoot back at the main character; Jarvis and DeMar liked the idea of a floating robot and felt it would be easier to animate. A projectile [[algorithm]] was devised for Enforcers to simulate enemy [[artificial intelligence in video games|artificial intelligence]]. The developers felt a simple algorithm of shooting directly at the protagonist would be ineffective because the character's constant motion would always result in a miss. Random elements were added to make the projectile more unpredictable; the Enforcer aims at a random location in a ten-[[pixel]] radius around the character, and random acceleration curves the [[trajectory]]. To further differentiate Enforcers, Jarvis devised the Spheroid enemy as a robot that continually generated Enforcers, rather than have them already on the screen like other enemies. Brains were conceived as robots that could capture humans and brainwash them into enemies called Progs, and also launch cruise missiles that chase the player in a random zigzag pattern, making them difficult to shoot down. DeMar devised the final enemies as a way to further increase the game's difficulty; Tanks that fire projectiles which bounce around the screen, and Quarks as a tank-producing robot.<ref name="Retro60"/>

In the summer of 2012, Eugene Jarvis wrote a comprehensive evaluation of the Robotron Enemy Dynamics: the game is [[hard-coded]] with 40 waves, whereupon the game repeats wave 21 to 40 over and over until the game restarts back to the original wave 1, once the player completes wave 255. In the same year, Larry DeMar provided details on how to trigger the secret copyright message in ''Robotron''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UJd2iFuTfY | title = Larry DeMar shows Robotron secret | website = [[YouTube]] | access-date = 2015-08-18 | archive-date = 2015-11-26 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151126080839/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UJd2iFuTfY | url-status = dead}}</ref>

Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra commented that ''Robotron''{{'}}s success, along with ''Defender'', illustrated that video game enthusiasts were ready for more difficult games with complex controls.<ref name="Gamasutra-History">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4099/the_history_of_robotron_2084__.php | title = The History of Robotron: 2084 - Running Away While Defending Humanoids | first1= Bill | last1= Loguidice | author2= Matt Barton | website = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2009-08-04 | access-date = 2009-10-15}}</ref> Though not the first to implement it,<ref group="Note">The two-joystick control scheme was previously used in Taito's ''[[Gun Fight]]'' (1975) and ''[[Space Dungeon]]'' (1981) as well as Artic Electronics' ''Mars'' (1981).</ref> ''Robotron: 2084''{{'}}s use of dual joysticks popularized the design among 2D shooting games, and has since been copied by other arcade-style games.<ref name="Retro60"/><ref name="Retro54"/><ref name="Coin-OpFavs"/><ref name="20Control">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2844/game_design_essentials_20_unusual_.php?page=2 | title = Game Design Essentials: 20 Unusual Control Schemes | first = John | last = Harris | website = Gamasutra | date = 2007-12-06 | access-date = 2009-05-12}}</ref> The control scheme has appeared in several other titles produced by Midway Games:<ref group="Note">Williams Electronics purchased Midway in 1988, and later transferred its games to the Midway Games subsidiary.</ref> ''Inferno'', ''Smash TV'', and ''[[Total Carnage]]''.<ref name="20Control"/> Many shooting games on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and [[PlayStation Network]] use this dual control design.<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] | publisher = [[Ziff Davis]] | date=November 2007 | issue = 221 | title = Online Scene: Robocopied | first = Michael | last = Donahoe | page = 50}}</ref><ref name="Retro49">{{cite journal | journal = [[Retro Gamer]] | title = Retro Rated: Omega Five | author = Retro Gamer Staff | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]] | issue = 49 | date=April 2008 | page = 88}}</ref><ref name="Retro55">{{cite journal | journal = [[Retro Gamer]] | title = Retro Rated: Commando 3 | author = Retro Gamer Staff | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]] | issue = 55 | date=October 2008 | page = 89}}</ref> The 2003 title ''[[Geometry Wars]]'' and its sequels also use a similar control scheme.<ref name="20Control"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21377 | title = Gamasutra's Best Of 2008: Top 10 Games Of The Year | author = Gamasutra Staff | website = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2008-12-23 | access-date = 2009-05-12}}</ref> The input design was most prominent in arcade games until video games with [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional (3D) graphics]] became popular in the late 1990s. Jarvis attributes the lack of proliferation in the home market to the absence of hardware that offered two side-by-side joysticks. Most 3D games, however, use the dual joystick scheme to control the movement of a character and a camera. Few console games, like the 2004 title ''[[Jet Li: Rise to Honor]]'', use two joysticks for movement and attacking.<ref name="Gamasutra-History"/>
