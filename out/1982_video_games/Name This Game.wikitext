'''''Name This Game and Win $10,000''''', usually shortened to '''''Name This Game''''', is a [[video game]] developed by [[U.S. Games]] for the [[Atari 2600]].

==Gameplay==
The player controls a [[scuba diver]] who must protect a treasure from an [[octopus]] at the top of the screen: The octopus tries to capture the treasure with its [[tentacle]]s. Meanwhile, a [[great white shark]] tries to distract the diver by swimming back and forth toward the bottom of the screen.

The diver loses a life if he is captured by the shark or the octopus's tentacles, or if the air meter runs out. The diver can refill his air meter by touching a long pole which extends from a boat that appears from time to time.

==History==
The game was conceived by Rob Dubren in February 1982. He offered it to [[Parker Bros.]], who owned the video game license for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitpress.com/video-game-guide/?mode=GameInfo&gameid=24723|title=Jaws (Atari 2600) - Video Game Guide|website=DigitPress.com|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> After Parker Bros. lost the license, the game was shown to Jim Wickstead of [[James Wickstead Design Associates]], who programmed it from August to October 1982. Originally developed as '''''Treasures of the Deep''''', the game was picked up by [[U.S. Games]] as '''''Guardians of Treasure'''''.

U.S. Games decided to create a contest around the game,<ref name="eg198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Programmable Arcade | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=6 January 2015 |author1=Katz, Arnie |author2=Kunkel, Bill | pages=38â€“42}}</ref> releasing it as '''''Name This Game and Win $10,000''''' with a cash prize to be awarded to the winning name after April 30, 1983. However, before the contest was completed, U.S. Games ceased operation.

Carrere Video Distribution released the game in Europe as ''Octopus''.{{cn|date=June 2020}} [[Amiga]] also planned to include the game in its ''Power Play Arcade #2'' cartridge under the name '''''Galleon's Gold''''', but development did not proceed past the prototype stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/powerarcade/powerarcade.htm|title=AtariProtos.com - All Your Protos Are Belong To Us!|website=Atariprotos.com|accessdate=12 December 2018}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1994, Digital Press held its own naming contest for the game. The winning title, coined by Russ Perry Jr., was '''''Going Under''''', which alluded not only to the game content, but to the final days of its publisher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitpress.com/video-game-guide/?mode=GameInfo&gameid=24144|title=Name This Game (Atari 2600) - Video Game Guide|website=DigitPress.com|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>
