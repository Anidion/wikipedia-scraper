==Reception==
Bill Willett reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "I would recommend ''Controller'' to those who would like a "thinking" game that doesn't let you dawdle around moving planes like chessmen. The arcade player, however, may be disappointed with the slow (real time) action of the game."<ref name="CGW5">{{cite magazine |last=Willett |first=Bill |title=Controller: A Review |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=July–August 1982 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=12–13}}</ref>
