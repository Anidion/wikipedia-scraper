{{nihongo foot|'''''BurgerTime''''',|バーガータイム|Bāgātaimu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} originally released as {{nihongo foot|'''''Hamburger'''''|ハンバーガー|Hanbāgā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in [[Japan]], is a 1982 [[arcade video game]] from [[Data East]] released initially for its [[DECO Cassette System]]. The player is chef Peter Pepper, who must walk over hamburger ingredients in a maze of platforms and ladders while avoiding anthropomorphic hot dogs, fried eggs, and pickles which are in pursuit. 

In the United States, Data East USA licensed ''BurgerTime'' for distribution by [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]] as a standard dedicated arcade game.<ref name="GM199">{{cite magazine|title=Overseas Readers Column: Deco "Burger Time" License - Midway For Coin-Op, Mattel For Home Video|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=199|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 November 1982|page=34|lang=ja}}</ref> Data East also released its own version of ''BurgerTime'' in the United States through its DECO Cassette System. The Data East and Midway versions are distinguished by the manufacturer's name on the title screen and by the marquee and cabinet artworks, as the game itself is identical. The game's original Japanese title ''Hamburger'' changed outside of Japan to ''BurgerTime'', reportedly to avoid potential trademark issues. In addition to all releases in the Western world, ''BurgerTime'' also became the title used for the Japanese ports and sequels.

The first home port of ''BurgerTime'' was released for the [[Intellivision]] console in 1983, followed by versions for other systems. There have been multiple sequels for both the arcade and home. 

When Data East went bankrupt in 2003, [[G-Mode]] bought most of Data East's [[intellectual property|intellectual properties]], including ''BurgerTime'', ''BurgerTime Deluxe'', ''Super BurgerTime'', and ''Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200402/ai_ziff118189 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501054244/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200402/ai_ziff118189 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-05-01 |title=G-Mode Buys Up Data East Catalog (Archived) |date=2007-08-28 |access-date=2012-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_bt/|title=VC バーガータイム|website=www.nintendo.co.jp}}</ref> 

==Gameplay==
[[File:BurgertimeInPlay.png|thumb|left|The first level of the arcade version, with Peter Pepper at center, climbing a ladder.]]

The object of the game is to build a number of hamburgers while avoiding enemy foods. The player controls the protagonist, chef Peter Pepper, with a four-position joystick and a "pepper" button.

Each [[game level|level]] is a maze of platforms and ladders in which giant burger ingredients (bun, meat patty, tomato, lettuce) are arranged. When Peter walks the full length of an ingredient, it falls to the level below, knocking down any ingredient that happens to be there. A burger is completed when all of its vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. The player must complete all burgers to finish the board.

Three types of enemy food items wander the maze: Mr. [[Hot dog|Hot Dog]], Mr. [[Pickled cucumber|Pickle]], and Mr. [[Egg (food)|Egg]]. The player can score extra points by either crushing them under a falling ingredient or dropping an ingredient while they are on it. In the latter case, the ingredient falls two extra levels for every enemy caught on it. Crushed or dropped enemies return to the maze after a short time.

At the start of the game, the player is given a limited number of pepper shots to use against enemies. Pressing the button causes Peter to shake a cloud of pepper in the direction he is facing; any enemy touching the cloud is briefly stunned, and Peter can safely move through them. Ice cream, coffee, and French fries appear on occasion, awarding bonus points and one extra pepper shot when collected.

There are six boards of increasing difficulty, with more burgers/ingredients, more enemies, and/or layouts that make it easier for Peter to become cornered. After the player completes the sixth board, the cycle repeats. One life is lost whenever Peter touches a non-stunned enemy, and the game ends once all lives are lost.

Following its North American debut at the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) show in November 1982, it was reviewed by ''Video Games'' magazine, which listed it as the show's fourth best game, while saying it was the "stupidest, silliest game ever, and that's why you couldn't get people off the Burger Time games with a crowbar!"

An arcade spin-off, ''Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory'' (1984), and an arcade sequel, {{nihongo|''Super BurgerTime''|スーパーバーガータイム}} (1990), were not widely released. ''Super BurgerTime'' stars Peter Pepper Jr. and allows two players to play at once. It is fairly true to the original, but with many added features and a different style of graphics.

A console-only sequel, ''Diner'', was created after the 1984 purchase of [[Intellivision]] from Mattel by INTV Corp. It was programmed by Ray Kaestner, the programmer of the Intellivision version of ''BurgerTime''. In ''Diner'', Peter Pepper must kick balls of food so that they roll off platforms and down ramps to land on a large plate at the bottom of the screen, while avoiding or crushing enemy food items that are trying to stop him.

''BurgerTime Deluxe'' was released for the [[Game Boy]] in 1991 featuring similar gameplay to the original arcade game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gameboy Burgetimer Deluxe 1991|url=http://churchofburgertime.com/history/btgameboy.html|website=Church of BurgerTime}}</ref> ''BurgerTime Deluxe'' was re-released for the [[Nintendo Switch]] through the [[Nintendo Switch Online]] Game Boy service.<ref>{{Cite web |title=New update adds Game Boy™, Super NES™, and NES™ classics to the Nintendo Switch Online games list |url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/new-nintendo-switch-online-classic-game-library-additions/ |access-date=2023-03-16 |website=www.nintendo.com |language=en-us}}</ref>

A crossover with ''[[The Flintstones]]'' titled ''The Flintstones: BurgerTime in Bedrock'' was released on [[Game Boy Color]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gbc/579040-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock/data|title = The Flintstones: BurgerTime in Bedrock Release Information for Game Boy Color - GameFAQs}}</ref>

Namco released ''BurgerTime Delight'' for mobile devices in 2007. It includes "new graphics, characters and power-ups".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.namcogames.com/mobile/burgertime-delight_5.html|title=''BurgerTime Delight'' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106110839/http://www.namcogames.com/mobile/burgertime-delight_5.html |archive-date=2009-01-06 |work=[[Namco]]}}</ref> There are six "arcade levels" and eight enhanced mode levels with perils of falling ice and rising fire from the grill. Besides the pepper of the classic game, there is now a salt shaker, that when collected stuns all enemies on the screen.

A 3D update, ''[[BurgerTime World Tour]]'', was released in 2011 for [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and [[PlayStation Network]], and in 2012 for [[WiiWare]].<ref name="worldtour">{{cite web |url=http://www.burgertimeworldtour.com |title=Burger Time World Tour |publisher=Burger Time World Tour |access-date=2012-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107053004/http://www.burgertimeworldtour.com/ |archive-date=2012-11-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It was delisted from Xbox Live Arcade in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cowan |first=Danny |date=April 15, 2014 |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-15-burgertime-world-tour-discounted-ahead-of-delisting-on-april-30.html |title=BurgerTime World Tour discounted ahead of delisting on April 30 |website=[[Engadget]] ([[Joystiq]]) |publisher=[[Yahoo (2017–present)|Yahoo]] |access-date=November 22, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424072618/http://m.joystiq.com/2014/04/15/burgertime-world-tour-discounted-ahead-of-delisting-on-april-30 |archive-date=April 24, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> G-Mode and XSEED Games released a re-imagining of the game on October 8, 2019, titled ''BurgerTime Party!'', for the [[Nintendo Switch]], with new modes and redesigns.
