The '''Horace''' video game series was created in the 1980s by [[William Tang (video game designer)|William Tang]] for [[Beam Software]]. The series comprised ''Hungry Horace'', ''Horace Goes Skiing'' and ''Horace and the Spiders''.

''Hungry Horace'' and ''Horace and the Spiders'' were two of the few [[ZX Spectrum]] games also available in ROM format for use with the [[ZX Interface 2|Interface 2]].

==Hungry Horace==
{{Main|Hungry Horace}}
The original Horace game, ''Hungry Horace'' was written as a simple ''[[Pac-Man]]'' clone,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/06/runit.htm |title=CRASH 6 – Run It Again |publisher=Crashonline.org.uk |access-date=2011-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Escape! |url=https://archive.org/stream/popular-computing-weekly-1983-01-06/PopularComputing_Weekly_Issue_1983-01-06#page/n11/mode/2up |work=Popular Computing Weekly |issue=6 January 1983}}</ref> published in 1982. In it, Horace must gather food from around a park and move onto the next section while avoiding park guards. It is possible for him to collect a bell to panic the guards and render them vulnerable, like the power pills in ''Pac-Man''. This title was available on the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Dragon 32]]. The ZX Spectrum original was marketed and distributed by Sinclair themselves, the Commodore 64 and Dragon 32 versions by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]].

==Horace Goes Skiing==

In 1983<ref name=eurogamer>{{cite web|last1=Mason|first1=Graeme|title=10 games that defined the ZX Spectrum|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-09-10-games-that-defined-the-zx-spectrum|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|access-date=10 April 2017|date=9 April 2017}}</ref> Tang produced ''Horace Goes Skiing'', in which Horace must cross a dangerous road teeming with traffic, à la ''[[Frogger]]'', to rent out a pair of skis, then get back over the road and successfully navigate a ski course.

Like ''Hungry Horace'', this title was available on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Dragon 32. As before, Sinclair distributed the Spectrum version, Melbourne House the Commodore 64 and Dragon 32 versions. In 2017, the game placed on ''[[Eurogamer]]'''s "10 games that defined the ZX Spectrum" list.<ref name=eurogamer />
''Horace Goes Skiing'' was released on Steam by Pixel Games UK in October 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Horace Goes Skiing on Steam|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1443640/Horace_Goes_Skiing/|access-date=2021-02-17|website=store.steampowered.com}}</ref>

==Horace and the Spiders==
[[Image:HoraceSpidersGame3.png|256px|thumb|left|In-game screen of ''Horace'' in the Spiders' Lair.]]
In 1983, Tang produced the third title in the series, ''Horace and the Spiders'' which was primarily a platform game. The first level sees Horace climbing a hill while jumping over spiders. The second level involves crossing a bridge by swinging on spider threads. The third level is the final confrontation with the spiders – he must create holes in the web, luring the spiders into the holes to fix them and subsequently jumping on them.

Unlike the earlier two titles, this game was only released for the ZX Spectrum. The first stage of this game shared similarities with both ''[[Pitfall!|Pitfall]]'' and the [[ColecoVision]] game ''[[Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle]]'', whilst the third platform stage is essentially a ''[[Space Panic]]'' clone.

==Horace to the Rescue==
This title was announced in 1985 but the game never appeared, due to the author Tang suffering a collapsed lung and being unable to continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/39/taylor.htm |title=CRASH 29 – TAYLOR MADE FOR MELBOURNE |publisher=Crashonline.org.uk |access-date=2011-02-06}}</ref>

==Horace in the Mystic Woods==
Horace made a comeback in 1995 with the platform based game ''Horace in the Mystic Woods'' for the [[Psion Series 3|Psion 3-Series]] of palmtop computers. This fourth entry in the Horace series is a platform game split into one-screen levels in the style of ''[[Manic Miner]]'' and was coded by Michael Ware of Proteus Developments. It is Series 3a/3c and 3mx compatible.

In 2010, a conversion of the game to the ZX Spectrum was released by indie coder Bob Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0025136 |title=Horace in the Mystic Woods conversion at World of Spectrum |publisher=Worldofspectrum.org |access-date=2011-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Horace in the Mystic Woods released on ZX Spectrum |url=http://retroactionmagazine.com/retronews/horace-in-the-mystic-woods-released-on-zx-spectrum/ |access-date=22 October 2019 |work=Retro Action |date=24 September 2010}}</ref>

==Other appearances==
In the Spectrum version of the 1987 game ''[[Inspector Gadget and the Circus of Fear]]'', Gadget has to make his way through several scrolling worlds. In the first of these, he is hindered by Horaces travelling in the opposite direction; if he trips over too many of them, he loses a life.

A reference to Horace is also present in the 2003 [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[Dog's Life]]'', which features a shop named ''Horace's Ski Shop''. The name is written in a font similar to the one used on the ZX Spectrum, and is accompanied by a Spectrum-style rainbow pattern.

A fan made game ''Horace Goes to the Tower'' was released in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://retroactionmagazine.com/retronews/horace-goes-to-the-tower-released-on-zx-spectrum/ |access-date=22 October 2019 |work=Retro Action |issue=31 Aug 2011|title=Horace Goes to the Tower released on ZX Spectrum}}</ref>
