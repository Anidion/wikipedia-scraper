released for the [[PC-8801]] computer in April 1982. 

It was one of the earliest commercial Japanese [[Adult video game|erotic computer game]]s, featuring sexually explicit images,<ref name="Retro"/> and a precursor to the modern [[eroge]] genre.<ref name="Jones"/> ''Night Life'' was marketed as an aid for the sex life of couples. It included such features as a schedule to determine a woman's [[menstruation|period]], and a catalog of possible [[sexual position]]s, with artwork consisting of black-and-white outlines.

The PC-8801 version got an English translation patch on May 19, 2022.
