==Gameplay==
''Computer Stocks & Bonds'' is a game in which the [[stock market]] is simulated.<ref name="CGW5"/> Players have ten turns, each representing one year, to invest in [[Security (finance)|securities]] (the [[wikt:eponymous|eponymous]] [[Stock|stocks]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]) with differing [[Risk factor (finance)|risks]] and [[Yield (finance)|yields]]. The securities' market prices fluctuate annually. The player who accumulates the most wealth by the end of the tenth year is declared the winner.<ref name="manual"/>

==Reception==
Bob Proctor reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Plausible reasons are given for very large gains and losses but these are after the fact: winning is largely a matter of luck. Two factors make this game unique: it is the only one of the four available for computers other than the Apple and it is the only one which needs only 32K of RAM (instead of 48K)."<ref name="CGW5">{{cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |title=We're in the Money...
