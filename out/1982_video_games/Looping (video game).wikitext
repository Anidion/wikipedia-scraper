'''''Looping''''' is an [[action game]] developed and published in arcades in 1982 by Video Games GmbH in Europe and Venture Line in North America. The player controls a plane across two phases in order to reach a docking station by destroying a terminal base or a rocket base to open a gate while avoiding obstacles along the way.

Conceived by Italian designer and engineer Giorgio Ugozzoli, ''Looping'' was the second of two original games produced by German game developer Video Games GmbH, the first being ''Super Tank'' (1981). The idea came up during a period when Ugozzoli obtained a license for both gliding and engine aircraft due to being a fan of flying. He was chosen by Video Games GmbH due to being one of the few people in Europe at the time working with the [[TMS1000]], as [[Texas Instruments]] suggested him to Video Games GmbH when looking for ideas and developers for a new project using the 8-bit [[Texas Instruments TMS9900#Variants|TMS9980]] processor. It was ported to the [[ColecoVision]] by Nuvatec in 1983. [[Video game conversion|Conversion]]s for the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]] were planned but never released.

''Looping'' was met with mixed reception from critics since its release on the ColecoVision but became one of the top-selling cartridges for the console in 1983; praise was given to the arcade-accurate presentation but others felt mixed in regards to sound design, while criticism was geared towards the frustrating gameplay and sensitive controls. A follow-up, ''Sky Bumper'' (1982), was developed shortly after the game's launch without involvement of Ugozzoli and released by Venture Line.

''Looping'' is a side-scrolling action game where players guide a plane capable of performing 360° loops by holding the joystick in one direction while steering up or down across two phases in order to reach a docking station.<ref name="CVGARCl">{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3ACVG_UK_011.pdf&page=79|title=Arcade Action: Amazing Antics In Aero-Maze - Looping|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=11|publisher=[[EMAP]]|date=September 1982|page=79|access-date=2021-06-17|archive-date=2021-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617005753/https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3ACVG_UK_011.pdf&page=79|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="LCVmanual">''Looping'' cartridge instructions (ColecoVision, US)</ref><ref name="CVEv1i1">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/ColecoVision_Experience_Volume_01_Issue_01_1983-06_Coleco_Industries#page/n5/mode/1up|title=What's New: Looping|magazine=ColecoVision Experience|volume=1|issue=1|publisher=[[Coleco]]|date=June 1983|page=4}}</ref><ref name="AllgameVC2600l">{{cite web|last=Marriott|first=Scott Alan|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=43917|title=Looping (Atari Video Computer System) - Overview|work=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=2003|access-date=2021-06-16|archive-date=2014-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115015810/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=43917|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Brett|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&pg=PA183|chapter=ColecoVision - Looping|title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984: A Complete Reference Guide|edition=1st|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|date=December 20, 2011|pages=183–184|isbn=9780786487554}}</ref> In multiplayer, two players alternate turns after losing one of their plane stocks.<ref name="AllgameVC2600l"/> The first phase starts in a runway and players must destroy either a terminal base or a rocket base to open a gate that leads to the second phase while avoiding hot-air balloon enemies and city obstacles.<ref name="CVGARCl"/><ref name="LCVmanual"/><ref name="CVEv1i1"/><ref name="AllgameVC2600l"/>

Unlike other game manufacturers, the staff adopted a rack system that consisted of CPU, I/O and power supply; Giorgio Ugozzoli designed the concept, graphic, CPU board and [[Printed circuit board|PCB]], while Video Games GmbH re-used the same video board and power supply from ''Super Tank''.<ref name="MAME2"/> Ugozzoli stated that he invested his savings on a development kit consisting of a TI-990/4 based on the 16-bit [[Texas Instruments TMS9900#Variants|TMS9900]] with an in-circuit emulation (ICE) for the TMS1000, while TI also gifted him an ICE for the TMS9900 with an [[operating system]], [[compiler]] and debugger.<ref name="MAME2"/> Ugozzoli made a first attempt using a [[Intel 8086]] chip, which was faster but not effective, as he was not able to have scrolling background and high sprite counts.<ref name="MAME2"/> Ugozzoli found the idea of working with 16-bit hardware to be thrilling and the sole solution, as his idea for ''Looping'' required "a lot of CPU."<ref name="MAME2"/>

''Looping'' was programmed over the course of eight months by [[University of Parma]] graduate engineers Marco, Pietro and Silvio, who worked underpaid during the process.<ref name="MAME2"/><ref name="G-H"/> Ugozzoli stated that the gameplay logic was developed in "Pascalator", a programming translator from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] to [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]], while the plane flight and shots were coded directly in assembler.<ref name="MAME2"/> Ugozzoli also stated that development was quick due to the rack system, allowing software development to precede in parallel to hardware development.<ref name="MAME2"/> Due to his connections, the [[speech synthesis]] was handled in a week at a Texas Instruments factory in [[Nice]], where Ugozzoli had previously completed speech for other products and the speech was provided by Giorgio Morosi.<ref name="MAME2"/> However, Ugozzoli claimed that programming the speech was very expensive, as staff chose single words or small phrases from a library by TI, though he refuted that the project was not costly.<ref name="MAME2"/> Ugozzoli revealed that a person named Mario created the sound effects.<ref name="MAME2"/> Ugozzoli recalled that how the plane controls should work became the most discussed point during development.<ref name="MAME2"/>

The [[ColecoVision]] conversion of ''Looping'' was met with mixed reception from critics since its release but proved to be one of the top-selling cartridges for the console in September 1983.<ref name="CVEv1i3">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/ColecoVision_Experience_Volume_01_Issue_03_1983-12_Coleco_Industries#page/n10/mode/1up|title=Hot Stuff & High Rollers: Best Sellers|magazine=ColecoVision Experience|volume=1|issue=3|publisher=[[Coleco]]|date=December 1983|page=9}}</ref> ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]''{{'}} Noel Steere gave the port a perfect rating and regarding its controls as unique.<ref name="EFwCaGcvL"/> Likewise, ''Video Games Player''{{'}}s Raymond Dimetrosky found the controls to be extremely sensitive, stating that young players may find the game frustrating, but praised the ColecoVision version for the colorful and detailed graphics as well as sound effects.<ref name="VGPcvL"/>

Helge Andersen of German magazine ''TeleMatch'' said that the unfamiliar controls were a constant challenge for players and regarded the title as a simple game without much technical effort. Andersen commended the visuals in the ColecoVision release but felt mixed in regards to the action and gameplay, however the sound design was panned.<ref name="TMcvL"/> French publication ''[[Tilt (French magazine)|Tilt]]'' gave positive remarks to the audiovisual presentation of the ColecoVision conversion.<ref name="TILTcvL1"/> ''[[AllGame]]''{{'}}s Brett Alan Weiss gave positive comments to the arcade-like graphics but found the music to be repetitive, while regarding the gameplay to be frustrating and tedious, stating that "''Looping'' for the ColecoVision is a very good translation of the Arcade game; unfortunately, the Arcade game is not much fun to begin with."<ref name="AllgameCVl"/>
