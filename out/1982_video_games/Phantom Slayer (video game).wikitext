'''''Phantom Slayer''''' is a [[video game]] released by Med Systems in 1982 for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] and [[Dragon 32/64]]. Written by [[Ken Kalish]], ''Phantom Slayer'' is considered by some{{who?|date=April 2017}} an early forerunner of the modern [[first-person shooter]] genre.

==Gameplay==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Phantom slayer screenshot.png|thumbnail|150px|left|Screenshot: A red-robed Phantom closes in on the player.]] -->
The player moves around a randomly generated [[maze]], attempting to kill the eponymous [[ghost|phantoms]] by shooting them.  As each level is cleared, a new maze is created, and the phantoms became harder (requiring more shots) to kill.

The game combines a relatively sedate pace and a then-rare [[first person (video games)|first-person point of view]] (using simple fixed-perspective graphics) to produce high levels of dramatic tension for a game on such primitive hardware. As the player moves around the maze, the only indication that a phantom is encroaching is an ominous sound played when the phantom is a few squares away from the player's position. The player can adjust the setting for the audio range finder to indicate the phantom's presence at close or further number of squares to help locate the phantom.  

A power-up time is required for the player's weapon, leading to the player holding a position in order to charge the weapon while stalking (or being stalked). The phantoms can take multiple hits (usually two). Combined with their creepy ability to get in close and blind-side the player, this is effective for elevating the fear factor.
