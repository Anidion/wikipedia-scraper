'''''Spider Fighter''''' is a [[fixed shooter]] designed by Larry Miller for the [[Atari 2600]] and published by [[Activision]] in 1982.<ref name="giantlist"/> The object of ''Spider Fighter'' is to protect an [[orchard]] containing [[fruit]]&mdash;[[grape]]s, [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], and [[banana]]s&mdash;from four kinds of bugs.<ref name="manual">{{cite web|title=Spider Fighter Manual|url=https://archive.org/details/Spider_Fighter_1983_Activision|website=archive.org|year=1983 }}</ref> ''Digital Press'' described it as "much like the coin-op game ''[[Stratovox]]'' but w/o the voice."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Digital Press Virtual Collectors Guide|url=http://www.digitpress.com/video-game-guide/?mode=GameInfo&gameid=24229|website=Digital Press}}</ref>

According to the manual, Miller was "the newest addition to the Activision design team."<ref name="manual"/> He went on to create the Atari 2600 racing game ''[[Enduro (video game)|Enduro]]'' for Activision, released in 1983.<ref name="giantlist"/>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Spider Fighter Atari 2600.jpg|thumb|left|The player still has all three oranges (upper right).]]

In each level, the player protects three pieces of fruit using a blaster that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen.  The joystick button fires a shot upward toward four types of attackers. Each level contains a set number of "master nests": enemies which can grab a piece of fruit and drag it off the left side of the screen. A nest drops the fruit when shot. The game ends if all fruit has been stolen or all of the blasters are destroyed. The type of fruit varies per level: grapes, strawberries, oranges, and bananas.

There is an option to have the shots move horizontally with the blaster after being fired, allowing them to be steered.<ref name=manual/>

At the time of release, anyone who sent a photo showing a score of 40,000 or more points received a patch for the Activision "Spider Fighters."<ref name="manual"/>

==Reception==
''Spider Fighter'' was not as successful as Activision's other fixed shooter released earlier the same year, ''[[Megamania]]''.

''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' gave the game 3 out 4 joysticks in the May 1983 issue.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wiswell |first1=Phil |title=Spider Fighter |url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_07_1983-05_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer__Games_Vol_01_No_07_1983-05_Fun__Games_Publishing_US#page/n61 |page=64 |date=May 1983|journal=[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]}}</ref> A June 1983 ''[[Electronic Games]]'' review was more critical, claiming it a "keen disappointment" and a "mediocre title from a superior game company."<ref name="eg">{{cite journal|title=Spider Fighter|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=June 1983|page=40|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n39/mode/2up}}</ref> ''Joystik'' took the middle road, calling it "a better than average bottom-shoot game that somehow looks like it should be more difficult than it is."<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Jim |last1=Gorzelany |title=The Home Front: Spider Fighter |journal=Joystik |date=July 1983 |volume=1 |issue=6 |page=61 |url=https://archive.org/details/joystik_magazine-1983-07/page/n61/mode/2up/}}</ref>

In an AtariHQ retrospective review, Keita Iida said "2600 players who are familiar with Activision's usual efforts (which are exceptional overall) might feel a bit let down by ''Spider Fighter''."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Iida|first1=Keita|title=Spider Fighter|url=http://www.atarihq.com/reviews/2600/spider_fighter.html|website=AtariHQ}}</ref>
