'''''Repton''''' is a [[video game]] originally developed by 16-year-old Briton Tim Tyler for the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] and released by [[Superior Software]] in 1985. The game spawned a series of follow up games which were released throughout the 1980s. The series sold around 125,000 copies between 1985 and 1990<ref name="eug64">[http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/64/a-rept.html Acornelectron.co.uk]; Repton on Acorn Electron World</ref> with ''Repton 2'' selling 35,000 itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Heading for the century|first=Tony|last=Leah|journal=Electron User|date=Feb 1989|publisher=Database Publications}} <!--[http://www.stairwaytohell.com/articles/EUFEB89-Superior.html StairwaytoHell.com]--></ref> The games have since been remade for several modern systems, including ''iRepton'' for the [[iPhone]] / [[iPod Touch]] in 2010, and<ref name=irepton>[http://www.iRepton.com/ iRepton website]</ref> ''Android Repton 1'', ''Android Repton 2'' and ''Android Repton 3'' from 2016 to 2018.<ref name=superior>[http://www.superiorinteractive.com/ Superior Interactive website]</ref>

The author was inspired by a review of the recently released ''[[Boulder Dash (video game)|Boulder Dash]]'', but had never played the game.<ref name="eug64" /> Compared with ''Boulder Dash'', ''Repton'' is a much more calm and organized playing experience with the emphasis on puzzle-solving as opposed to arcade-style improvisation. This remained true as more types of object were added in the sequels.

===''Repton''===
[[File:Repton level L.jpg|thumb|left|In-game shot of the final level, Screen L (BBC Micro)]]
Repton, the titular protagonist, is moved around an underground maze in a quest to find all the diamonds (some are held in safes, their release being triggered by finding and collecting a key) within a time limit for each of several levels, while avoiding being trapped or killed by falling rocks and monsters hatched from eggs. The original ''Repton'' game was released in the summer of 1985 and has 12 levels, with [[password (video games)|passwords]] making it possible to jump directly to later levels. If passwords are employed, on completion of the final level the displayed message challenges the player to complete the game without using them. The new versions of ''Repton'' for the PC, iOS and Android introduce additional levels; new ''Repton'' levels are also featured in ''Repton Spectacular'', ''Repton's Mystic Challenge (for Repton 1)'' and ''Repton's Journeys (for Repton 2)''.

===''Repton 2''===
The sequel to the game, ''Repton 2'', released for Christmas 1985 (release date 14 November 1985 <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Superior Software advert|journal=Electron User|volume=3|issue=2|pages=45|date=Nov 1985|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/eu/cats/eu3_02.html|access-date=2015-02-27|archive-date=2011-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717131551/http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/eu/cats/eu3_02.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>) is much bigger. It introduces several new features: spirits (that follow walls and objects to their left and must be guided into cages, turning them into diamonds) and skulls, both of which are fatal to Repton on collision. There are also jigsaw puzzle pieces to collect, which eventually spell out the message "Repton 2 is ended". There are no levels as such in ''Repton 2'': instead transporters move Repton between different screens which, subject to some restrictions, can be completed in any order desired. The entire game is in effect one very large level without passwords, meaning that it must be completed in one attempt. Finally, some screens also contain an exposed 'roof', where meteors (predictably fatal to Repton) fall from the sky.

Repton's requirements in ''Repton 2'' are challenging: Repton must not only collect all diamonds (including those held in safes and behind cages), but also collect all earth, kill all the monsters, collect all puzzle pieces and use all transporters. Once these substantial tasks have been accomplished, Repton must then negotiate the 'roof' of the entire width of the final screen, avoiding meteors falling from the sky in order to reach the starport and thus complete the game. This part is particularly tricky, since the meteors fall in a random fashion, making it difficult for the gamer to guide Repton to safety. This long list of requirements, coupled with the fact that the game must be completed in one attempt, marks ''Repton 2'' as the hardest ''Repton'' game to successfully complete.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The initial version of ''Repton 2'' contained one diamond fewer than the stipulated number needed to finish the game, so completion of this first version is impossible.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} When ''Repton 2'' was re-written for the PC, it introduced a 'save game' feature making it considerably easier to complete. In addition, brand new scenarios were included, effectively new games.

===''Repton 3''===
''Repton 3'', released on 5 November 1986,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Superior Software advert|journal=Electron User|date=November 1986|volume=4|issue=2|pages=56|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/eu/cats/eu4_02.html|access-date=2015-02-27|archive-date=2014-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918203359/http://acornelectron.co.uk/mags/eu/cats/eu4_02.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> was developed by Matthew Atkinson at Superior's invitation since Tim Tyler was not interested in programming it, although he did design some of the levels for the new game. While the first two games had only taken a month each to program, ''Repton 3'' took eight months.<ref name="eug64" /> It reverts to the form of a series of time-limited, password-protected levels. A few new features were introduced: fungus (a substance that gradually spreads wherever it finds space and kills Repton on contact), time capsules (resetting the current level's time limit each time one is collected), crowns and a timebomb which must be defused to complete each level. The inclusion of the timebomb means that, as well as collecting all of the diamonds and crowns, the players have to plan their routes so as to finish up at the timebomb at the end of the level.

''Repton 3'' includes a map editor along with the game, so that data files can be created with new maps and graphics for the levels. Three themed sets of such files were released as continuations of ''Repton 3'', with the titles ''Around the World in 40 Screens'' (1987), ''The Life of Repton'' (1987) and ''Repton Thru Time'' (1988). These three titles use a slightly modified game engine, in which the algorithm for deciding on the direction spirits first move at the start of a level is improved. They all come with the same game editor as ''Repton 3''.

===''Repton Infinity''===
''Repton Infinity'' was released in 1988, by which time the BBC Micro's popularity as a games platform was beginning to wane. It was developed by Dave Acton and Dave Lawrence (who wrote the user-submitted program section *INFO in ''[[Acorn User]]'' magazine). It supplements the map editor and graphics editor with a powerful game logic editor which made it possible to alter the way all game objects behaved using a purpose-designed language called ''Reptol''. Four different example games are included to demonstrate its flexibility:
* ''Repton 3 - Take 2'', with a couple of small technical differences in gameplay from ''Repton 3''.
* ''Repton 4'', with imaginative new objects including photocopiers and moving jewels.
* ''Robbo'', "a crazy robot in a strange topsy-turvy world", according to the game inlay.
* ''Trakker'', a chaotic game in which a bulldozer-driving protagonist must destroy various monsters by pushing fruit at them, and all scores are multiples of 17.

There was a long-running problem, infamous amongst owners of the B+, the updated BBC B with 64k, when the newly released ''Repton Infinity'' ran on the original BBC B but refused to load on the updated B+. A string of unsuccessful replacements were issued before one that was compatible with both was eventually released.

===''EGO: Repton 4''===
A game marketed as ''EGO: Repton 4'' was released for the [[Acorn Archimedes]] in 1992. It was designed by Richard Hanson and programmed by Gary Partis. This was actually an Archimedes conversion of an earlier [[Amiga]]/[[Atari ST]] game called ''Personality Crisis'' with the character of Repton added in.<ref>[http://www.partis.org/portfolio/main.php?entry=1992-xx-xx-repton4.txt&sid=ce44aeaec5eca24c21e3565c271f84a8 ''Repton 4 - Ego''], Gary Partis portfolio, Partis Computing (Retrieved 2011-12-04)</ref> The game bears little relation to the rest of the Repton series, particularly in that contrary to the spirit of the original it relies on "secret" traps and passages which can only be discovered by walking onto them. The objects and objectives in all the previous ''Repton'' games are visible and there are no hidden secrets to be discovered, although in some advanced episodes - notably "OAP" in ''Life of Repton'', "Oceans" in ''Around the World'' and "Future" in ''Repton Thru Time'' - some objects and enemies are invisible or appear very similar to desirable or innocuous objects.

===''Repton: The Lost Realms''===
In 1988, teenage programmer Paras Sidapara submitted a game he called ''Repton 4'' to Superior Software. As Superior were already working on ''Repton Infinity'', it was not published, and was forgotten until 2008, when a copy was rediscovered. The game was re-programmed by Sarah Walker and rechristened ''The Lost Realms'', to avoid confusion with the ''Repton 4'' game included in ''Repton Infinity''. It was launched in November 2010 by Retro Software, with Superior's permission.<ref>[http://www.retrosoftware.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Repton:_The_Lost_Realms Retro Software's Repton: The Lost Realms page]</ref> The game is similar in style to ''Repton 3'', retaining the structure of separate, password-protected levels and the map and graphics editors. New features include balloons, "absorbency" doors (which can be opened when an "absorbalene" pill is collected, but each pill only allows a certain number of doors to be opened) and ice crystals (which, when collected, freeze any monsters on the level).

==Music==
The music for ''Repton'' is ''[[Black and White Rag]]'', by [[George Botsford]], which has been well-known in the UK since at least its 1969 popularisation as the theme tune to the long-running television [[snooker]] programme ''[[Pot Black]]''. The [[Scott Joplin]] intermezzo ''The Chrysanthemum'' is the music for ''Repton 2'', and the music for ''Repton 3'' was composed specifically for the game by Paul Hughes and Peter Clarke. ''Repton Infinity'' features in-game music, on pressing the 'T' key, although it does not play at the same time as the sound effects during the game, and is turned off by default; it was composed especially for the game by David Acton.

==''Repton'' ports, clones and derivatives==
===Ports===
The ''Repton'' games were closely associated with the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] but versions were released for other [[8-bit]] computers. [[Superior Software]] had planned to launch ''Repton 3'' with ports for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] (as shown in pre-release press advertisements).<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Electron User|date=November 1986|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013843/http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eu/ills/4_02/s-p56.jpg|archivedate=2007-09-27|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eu/ills/4_02/s-p56.jpg |title=Repton 3 quarter-page advertisement}}</ref> The Amstrad version was never released but the C64 port did arrive in 1987. Ports of the first 3 ''Repton'' games were later developed for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and ''Repton'' and ''Repton 2'' were released together as ''Repton Mania'' in 1989 (published using the joint [[Superior Software|Superior]]/[[Alligata]] name). This was not a success and the Spectrum ''Repton 3'' was not released. In 1989 a version of ''Repton 3'' featuring all expansion packs was also released for the BBC Micro's replacement, the [[32-bit]] [[Acorn Archimedes]]. Its programmer, John Wallace, also produced a slightly expanded version of ''Repton 2'' for the Acorn Archimedes which was released on the 1993 ''Play It Again Sam 2'' compilation (which also included ''[[Zarch]]'', ''Master Break'' and ''Arcpinball''). None of these ports achieved the sales of the BBC originals.

In the late 1990s, Superior sub-licensed the games to ProAction who released a number of [[RISC OS]] ports for the Acorn Archimedes and RiscPC. John Wallace created new ports of ''Repton'', ''Repton 2'' and ''Repton 3''. ProAction also released ''Desktop Repton'' which includes the 3 games (including the expansion games for ''Repton 3''). These games were built from scratch by Darren Salt, and developed to run in a multi tasking window on the desktop.

There have been numerous ports of ''Repton 3'', including a free version for [[Linux]].<ref>[http://www.keelhaul.me.uk/krepton/ KRepton]</ref>

Under the name Superior Interactive,<ref>[http://www.superiorinteractive.com/ SuperiorInteractive.com]</ref> the original publishers re-released versions of ''Repton 1'' (2003), ''Repton 2'' (2004) and ''Repton 3'', including all of the expansion games (2005), for [[Microsoft Windows]]. They also released a large pack of new levels for all three modern Repton ports named ''Repton Spectacular'' in 2010. Also in 2010, ''iRepton'' was released for the Apple [[iPhone]] / [[iPod Touch]] (ESZ Consulting / Superior Interactive). This has retro and enhanced graphics and sounds and new screens.<ref name=irepton /> In 2014 ''iRepton 3'' was released for the iPad and iPhone, featuring the same level of graphic enhancements as ''iRepton 1'', which also had an overhaul at the same time.

===Clones===
A deliberate clone called ''Ripton'', extremely faithful apart from different level design and several humorous digs at the original game, was written by Kenton Price and submitted to ''A&B Computing'' but the magazine never dared to publish it. It is, however, now available at BBC software Internet sites.

There was also a [[Public domain|PD]] clone for the [[ZX Spectrum]] called ''Riptoff'', which included a level editor. It was developed by Rick O'Neill and Craig Hunter, and was released exclusively on a 1991 [[Your Sinclair]] covertape.<ref>''[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004151 Riptoff]'' at [[World of Spectrum]]</ref>

===Derivatives===
Due to ''Repton'''s ubiquity on the platform, it is sometimes compared to other scrolling-map games for the BBC/Electron. Later puzzle-based games such as ''[[Bonecruncher]]'' and ''Clogger'' might be said to be derivatives of ''Repton'', and this perception is also encompassed by [[arcade adventure]]/[[role-playing game]]s presented in four-way-scrolling format – the notable ones being ''[[Ravenskull (computer game)|Ravenskull]]'' and ''[[Pipeline (game)|Pipeline]]'' – despite their different styles involving unique objects, encounters and unexpected traps.

A non-scrolling 5-level [[type-in program|type-in]] called ''Pitfall Pete'' written by Jonathan Temple was also described as "'Repton' style" when it was published by [[BEEBUG]] in 1986<ref>{{cite journal |last=Temple |first=Jonathan |date=December 1986 |title=Pitfall Pete |journal=Beebug |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=57}}</ref> and expanded to 15 levels in 1991.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Temple |first=Jonathan |date=December 1991 |title=Pitfall Pete |journal=Beebug |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=49}}</ref>

''Repton'''s original author has written a [[public domain]]<ref>[https://sourceforge.net/projects/rockz/ Rockz SourceForge page] (linked to from Rockz site) says License: Public Domain</ref> [[Java applet|Java]] rocks-and-diamonds game, Rockz,<ref>[http://rockz.co.uk/ Rockz]</ref> which features elements in the vein of both ''Repton 2'' and ''Boulder Dash''.

A game called ''Mole Miner'' was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in 2009 by Little Fluffy Toys Ltd. The game was designed by Kenton Price, who also wrote ''Ripton''. It builds on the rocks-and-diamonds genre typified by ''Repton'', extending it with features such as explosives, sliding ice and wraparound, and includes a community level designer. ''Mole Miner'' contains 60 levels created by Michael S. Repton, the author of many levels in later ''Repton'' series games.
