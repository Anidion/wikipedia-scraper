'''''Entombed''''' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game published by [[Ultimate Play the Game]] for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1985. It is the second instalment of the ''Pendragon'' series and is a sequel to ''[[The Staff of Karnath]]''. The game features series protagonist and [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] adventurer, ''Sir Arthur Pendragon'', as he attempts to escape an ancient Egyptian tomb before all oxygen runs out. As with its predecessor, ''Entombed'' is presented in an isometric format.

The game was created and designed by brothers Dave and Bob Thomas, with Ultimate founders [[Tim and Chris Stamper]] otherwise being uninvolved in development. ''Entombed'' took considerably longer to develop due to the re-programming of its [[game engine]]. It received positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise being directed at its playability and graphics. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Blackwyche]]'', which was released later in the year.

The game is presented in an [[isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] format and is set inside an [[ancient Egypt]]ian tomb. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to escape the tomb, the [[Great Sphinx]], before all oxygen runs out.<ref name=PC/> To achieve this end, the player must navigate a series of chambers linked by corridors, solve logic [[puzzle game|puzzles]] and deal with hostile enemies by either avoiding or fighting them. The tomb has seven floors.<ref name=history/> Pendragon's only form of defence is his whip, which he can utilise to defend himself from enemies.<ref name=PC/> The player also has access to a [[flashlight|torch]], which will allow them to see in certain pitch-black areas of the tomb.<ref name=PC/>

Unlike other games from the ''Pendragon'' series, ''Entombed'' features no collectable items required to finish the game.<ref name=zap/> The player-character has a life bar, which will deplete every time he makes contact with an enemy. To replenish life, the player must kill crows which will spawn in rooms at various times, and upon its death the crow will drop an [[Ankh]] symbol, the ancient Egyptian "Symbol of Life".<ref name=CG/> If the player completely runs out of life or if all the oxygen runs out from the tomb, then the game will end.<ref name=CG/>

The ''Pendragon'' series and ''The Staff of Karnath'' were created by brothers Dave and Robert "Bob" Thomas, rather than Ultimate founders Tim and Chris Stamper.<ref name=history/> Dave Thomas began his career in 1983 when he began producing games for the [[Atari 400]], including moderate-sellers such as ''Warlok'', which won him {{GBP|5,000|link=yes}} in a competition from Calisto Software. Although he later began working for the company in producing video games, he quit due to the strain of his daily {{convert|68|mi}} commute. Shortly after quitting Calisto Software, Dave Thomas started work on ''The Staff of Karnath''. Bob Thomas was a trained technical illustrator for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and had experience with designing interiors for the [[Royal Navy]], which later aided to the military-themed visuals of the ''Pendragon'' series.<ref name=history/> As with all games in the ''Pendragon'' series, ''Entombed'' was programmed by Dave Thomas, whereas the graphics were designed by Bob Thomas. Dave Thomas admitted in a March 2008 interview that the name of the series protagonist, "Sir Arthur Pendragon", was copied from the character of the Black Prince Pendragon from the ''Jack the Giant Killer'' stories.<ref name=history/> According to Dave Thomas, ''Entombed'' had the longest development cycle due to the expansion of the previous engine.<ref name=history/>

Cook praised the game's puzzle sections, comparing them more favourably than those of its predecessor, and summarised that the game was "definitely a must for any adventurer's collection".<ref name=PC/> Rignall stated that the puzzles "have logical and sometimes spectacular solutions" and similarly praised them more favourably than those in ''[[The Staff of Karnath]]''. However, Rignall criticised the sprites of the game, asserting that they were "large and crude".<ref name=zap/>
