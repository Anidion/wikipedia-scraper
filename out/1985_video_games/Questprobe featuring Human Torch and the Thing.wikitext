==Reception==
John Sweeney for ''[[Page 6]]'' said: "It's got some pretty pictures â€“ if you don't mind waiting while they load".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Page_6_Issue_25_1987-01_ABACUS_GB/page/n71/mode/2up|title=Page 6 - Issue 25 (1987-01)(ABACUS)(GB)|date=January 18, 1987|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Derek Brewster for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' wrote: "This third release shows little care for what the British adventure market wants and I think it unlikely that people are that interested in mind-bogglingly difficult games constructed in such an uncaring fashion".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Crash_Magazine_030/page/76/mode/2up|title=Crash Magazine 030|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave a positive review of the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_0050/page/n7/mode/2up|title=Computer and Video Games Issue 0050|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Your Sinclair]]'' wrote that "the game's still sufficiently interesting to keep you trying, as you wonder if the solution lies in battling with Blob, inside the circus tent, or in the hot little hands of the Human Torch himself".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Your_Sinclair_007/page/76/mode/2up|title=Your Sinclair 007|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

David Williams for ''[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]'' said that "''Questprobe 3'' will definitely be a giant hit but my feeling is that the Adams database is a little obscure and the price is [...] too much, but I doubt if that will deter any would-be superhero/ines from buying the game".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Your_Computer_Magazine_Issue_V606/page/32/mode/2up|title=Your Computer Magazine Issue V606|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Peter Sweasey for ''ZX Computing'' wrote that "''Questprobe 3'' is not a bad game in itself, but when compared with products like Level 9 games, or even some budget titles, it is weak".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/zxcomputing-magazine-1986-07/page/n35/mode/2up|title=ZX Computing Magazine (July 1986)|date=July 18, 1986|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Zzap!64]]'' said: "As with all of Scott's games, the location descriptions are extremely brief, though in this case the graphics are of such a high quality that the atmosphere of the game isn't seriously affected by this. Nevertheless this is definitely not a game for text-only fanatics".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ZZap64Issue0151986Jul/page/n71/mode/2up|title=ZZap_64_Issue_015_1986_Jul|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Commodore Computing International]]'' described the game as "a good adventure, with quite a challenge. Despite being slow, it is well thought out, and two characters having to be controlled, makes a refreshing deviation from the standard adventure route".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Commodore_Computing_International_Vol_05_No_02_1986-09_Croftward_GB/page/n39/mode/2up|title=Commodore Computing International - Vol 05 No 02 (1986-09)(Croftward)(GB)|date=September 18, 1986|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Richard Price for ''[[Sinclair User]]'' wrote: "All told, a fairly inaccessible game opening with a linear set of problems in a closed set of locations. Unless you're smart enough to get through this in one or two goes you may well end up feeling cheated and disappointed".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Sinclair_User_051/page/53/mode/2up|title=Sinclair User 051|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
