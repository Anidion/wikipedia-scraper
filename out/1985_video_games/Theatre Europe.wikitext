'''''Theatre Europe''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] video game developed and published by [[Personal Software Services]] (PSS). It was first released in the United Kingdom for the [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Atari 8-bit computers]]
in 1985. It was later released in France by [[ERE Informatique]] in 1986, and was released in the United States by [[Datasoft]] later that year. A port for the [[Tatung Einstein]] was released in 1989, in the UK. It is the fifth installment of the ''Strategic Wargames'' series.

The game is set during a fictional war in Europe between [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], in which both sides use [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[chemical weapon]]s. The developers used information and statistics on military strength from the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and the [[Embassy of Russia, London|Soviet embassy]] in London. The objective is to fight conventional battles in continental Europe, whilst trying to avoid a worldwide [[nuclear holocaust]]. During the game, capital cities and their civilian populations are destroyed by nuclear weapons. The game ends once either side is forced to surrender or if the entire population of Europe perishes. To request a nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number to hear an automated message giving the authorisation code.

''Theatre Europe'' was criticized by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper. Some high street retail chains refused to sell the game upon release. The game received critical acclaim for its accuracy, playability and value for money. It won the "Best Strategy Game" award at the 1985 [[Golden Joystick Awards]] and was nominated for "Game of the Year".

PSS released a [[16-bit]] follow-up game in 1989, ''[[Conflict: Europe]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Railton |first1=Ken |title=Games - Conflict Europe |journal=[[ST Format]] |date=October 1989 |issue=3 |page=74 |url=http://www.atarimania.com/atari-magazine-issue-st-format-issue-03_1144.html |publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Rignall |first1=Julian |title=Review - Conflict in Europe [sic] |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=August 1989 |issue=93 |page=74 |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-093b/page/n73/mode/2up |publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Theatre Europe gameplay 1.png|thumb|left|250px|A map displaying NATO and Soviet troop deployments in Europe. The background colour will turn red once a chemical or nuclear strike is imminent.]]
The game is a [[turn-based strategy]] and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of [[NATO]] and allies of the [[Warsaw Pact]].<ref name=zzap/> The player has the choice of choosing either NATO or the Warsaw Pact (collectively referred to as Soviet forces), or a "demo" computer versus computer option, where the game plays itself.<ref name=YS/><ref name=crash/> The game takes place over a period of 30 in-game days, in which one day is equal to one "round".<ref name=YS/><ref name=CVG/> There are three types of difficulty; level one, in which unless provoked, the enemy will not use nuclear weapons, whilst levels two and three will enable the enemy to use [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[chemical weapon|chemical]] attacks to prevent the player from winning the game.<ref name=crash/>

The main feature of the game is focused on a map of Europe and western Russia, which displays accurate terrain such as mountain ranges, major cities, borders and all military forces belonging to each side. The game also features an arcade sequence which involves shooting down enemy units in order to secure combat bonuses; this gameplay mode, however, can be ignored by changing the game's settings.<ref name=YS/> If the arcade sequences are turned on, the player will be notified to choose a battle on the map. Depending on the area chosen, an illustration of a battle commencing in countryside or a city is presented with various forms of military equipment including aeroplanes, helicopters and tanks. The player must shoot down and destroy enemy units using their cursor, in similar style to ''[[Missile Command]]''.<ref name=crash/> The outcome of the arcade sequence will affect the game;<ref name=YS/> performing poorly will result in severe losses throughout that round.<ref name=crash/>

After combat has been resolved, the player must move and assemble their forces in continental Europe, which is known as the movement phase.<ref name=SU/> Two special units are exclusively available to the Warsaw Pact: "the 1st Airborne Army which can be flown directly behind enemy lines, and the 1st Amphibious Army which can move over the sea to a tactical attack point".<ref name=crash/> Units are moved by cursor, and only one may be moved at a time. Once all units have been moved within a round, the attack phase will begin. Any amount of friendly units may attack an opposing army; however, once a unit has been dispatched for battle it cannot be stopped until the current attack phase concludes.<ref name=crash/><ref name=CVG/> During the attacking phase, a separate screen displaying combat information, such as enemy numbers and casualties, is displayed.<ref name=CG/> If the screen detailing the attacking phase has been turned off in the settings, the battle will instead be decided on warrants of air superiority and armaments.<ref name=crash/>

[[File:Theatre Europe gameplay 2.png|thumb|right|250px|In this sequence, a capital city and its civilian population have been completely destroyed by nuclear weapons.]]

After battle sequences, the player will have the opportunity to rebuild their units by allocating a quantity of armament supplies, such as air support, which can be issued to any friendly unit on the map. After rebuilding ground units, the game will move onto an "air phase", which consists of commanding aircraft such as aeroplanes, bombers and a limited number of reserve air units.<ref name=crash/> Several options for allocating air forces include: counter air strikes, [[reconnaissance]] on enemy movement, [[interdiction]], assault breakers, and deep strikes.<ref name=CG/><ref name=crash/> Counter air strikes involve attacks on enemy air bases, whereas interdiction involves aircraft being sent behind enemy lines in order to attack supply and movement networks. If interdiction aircraft are discovered in enemy territory, there will be a chance that the side will respond with a retaliatory nuclear strike.<ref name=crash/> The remaining three aircraft options are to attack a single unit, strike enemy territory, and attack railways in order to disable enemy reinforcements, respectively.<ref name=zzap/>

The game allows the player to request chemical and nuclear tactical strikes against the enemy. A chemical attack is automatically targeted at an enemy capital city, and will conclude with a readout announcing the outcome of the attack, such as civilian casualties. In order to launch a strategic nuclear attack, the player is given 30 seconds to call a dedicated [[1-800]] telephone number and obtain a special authorisation code from the automated answerphone message (the authorisation code was 'Midnight Sun').<ref name="Goldberg2015">{{cite book|author=Daniel Goldberg|title=The State of Play: Creators and Critics on Video Game Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXnWBQAAQBAJ|date=20 October 2015|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=978-1-60980-640-8}}</ref><ref name=crash/><ref name=zzap/><ref name=PSS>{{cite journal|title=History of PSS|journal=Your Computer|date=13 June 1986|volume=6|issue=6|pages=84â€“85|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-computer-magazine-1986-06/YourComputer_1986_06#page/n83/mode/2up|access-date=3 October 2015}}</ref> Once the authorisation code has been received, the player will be given three separate options on how to proceed. Standby mode will postpone the nuclear launch, whereas a strategic launch will involve one nuclear warhead targeting a city. The third option, known as "Fire-Plan", will issue a full-scale nuclear strike across Europe and results in a [[nuclear holocaust]], which will end the game.<ref name=crash/><ref name=zzap/><ref name=CG/>

In an interview with ''Your Computer'' magazine, Gary Mays stated that ''Theatre Europe'' received heavy criticism from the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND).<ref name=PSS/> The CND accused the developers of "bad taste", despite Cockayne claiming that the organisation never "looked into the product".

The game received critical acclaim upon release. Gwyn Hughes of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' defended the accuracy and morality of the game, stating that it was not in "bad taste" and that the game was a "well researched program", which he thought would give the player an insight into the nature of modern war.<ref name=YS>{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Gwyn|title=Theatre Europe review|journal=Your Sinclair|date=August 1986|issue=8|page=67|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/theatreeurope.htm|access-date=31 December 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306033551/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/theatreeurope.htm|archive-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> Philippa Irving of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' similarly stated that ''Theatre Europe'' offered more than a usual "run-of-the-mill" war game and heralded its simplistic nature, adding that novice gamers would "get in to it with ease".<ref name=crash>{{cite journal|last1=Irving|first1=Philippa|title=Theatre Europe review (Crash)|journal=Crash|date=July 1986|issue=30|pages=54, 55|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/30/t_europe.htm|access-date=31 December 2015}}</ref> John Gilbert of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' added scepticism over the developer's intention of making something "so serious" as opposed to their other titles; however he praised the game as a "brilliant, if chilling" simulation.<ref name=SU>{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=John|title=Theatre Europe review|journal=Sinclair User|date=August 1986|issue=53|page=61|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/SinclairUser/Issue053/Pages/SinclairUser05300061.jpg}}</ref> A reviewer writing for ''ZX Computing'' similarly  stated that the game was "superbly chilling" and "extremely" well-presented.<ref name=ZX>{{cite journal|title=Theatre Europe and Iwo Jima review|journal=ZX Computing|date=August 1986|issue=86|page=43|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/ZXComputing/Issue8608/Pages/ZXComputing860800043.jpg}}</ref> A reviewer of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' criticised the inferior graphics on the [[ZX Spectrum]], stating that they were "a bit flawed" in comparison to the [[Commodore 64]] version.<ref name=CVG>{{cite journal|title=Theatre Europe review (CVG)|journal=Computer and Video Games|date=October 1986|issue=61|page=43|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue061/Pages/CVG06100043.jpg}}</ref>

Bill Harrington reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that " TE does a credible job of demonstrating the perils of escalation and dramatizing how slippery the slope to nuclear war might be, but is basically a game in search of a market."<ref name="CGW39">{{cite magazine |last=Harrington |first=Bill |title=Theatre Europe: Datasoft Goes To War |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Augâ€“Sep 1987 |volume=1 |issue=39 |pages=32â€“33}}</ref>

''[[Computer Gamer]]'' noted that the game attracted media attention, despite the objective of the game discouraging the use of nuclear weapons. Reed praised the presentation and gameplay, also stating that the use of a joystick and keyboard is "excellent".<ref name=CG>{{cite magazine|last1=Staff|title=Theatre Europe review|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_17_1986-08_Argus_Press_GB/page/n94/mode/1up?view=theater|magazine=Computer Gamer|date=August 1986|issue=17|page=95}}</ref> A reviewer from ''[[Zzap!64]]'' heralded the presentation and value for money, stating that it is overall "very special indeed".
