'''''Ballyhoo''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] game designed by Jeff O'Neill and published by [[Infocom]] in 1985.<ref name=iforg/> The [[circus]]-themed game was released for ten systems, including [[MS-DOS]], [[Atari ST]], and [[Commodore 64]]. ''Ballyhoo'' was labeled as "Standard" difficulty.<ref name=iforg/> It is Infocom's nineteenth game.

==Plot==
The player's character is bedazzled by the spectacle of the [[circus]] and the mystery of the performer's life. After attending a show of Tomas Munrab's "The Travelling Circus That Time Forgot", the player loiters near the tents instead of rushing through the exit. Maybe some [[clown]]s will practice a new act, or perhaps at least one of the [[trapeze]] artists will trip...

Instead, the player overhears a strange conversation. The circus' owner has hired a drunken, inept detective to find his daughter Chelsea, who has been [[kidnapping|kidnapped]]. Munrab is convinced that it was an outside job; surely his loyal employees would ''never'' betray him like this!

As the player begins to investigate the abduction, it soon becomes clear that the circus workers don't appreciate the intrusion. Their reactions range from indifference to hostility to attempted murder. In order to unravel the mystery, the player engages in a series of actions straight out of a circus fan's dream: dressing up as a clown, walking the high wire, and taming [[lion]]s.

==Release==

''Ballyhoo'' included the following physical items in the package:<ref name=gallery/>
#An "Official [[Souvenir]] Program" from The Traveling Circus That Time Forgot describing each of the featured acts and listing common circus slang
#A ticket to the circus
#A toy [[balloon]] imprinted with the circus' name and logo (blue was the most common color, although a few orange or black ones were also shipped)
#A [[trade card]] for "Dr. Nostrum's Extract", a fictitious [[patent medicine]] hailed as a "wondrous curative" containing 19% alcohol

==Reception==
''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' in 1986 called ''Ballyhoo'' "richly evocative, often exasperating, and very clever". The magazine approved of the splendid feelies and "surprisingly flexible" parser.<ref name="rouleau198606">{{Cite magazine |last=Rouleau |first=Jean |date=June 1986 |title=Ballyhoo |url=https://archive.org/details/1986-06-computegazette/page/n47 |magazine=Compute!'s Gazette |pages=46,48 |access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''[[The Lost Treasures of Infocom]]'' bundled 20 Infocom releases, including ''Ballyhoo''. This package as shipped lacked some information necessary to complete the game; the final page of the souvenir program was omitted. This page was an ad for a [[european classical music|classical music]] [[radio station]]; at one point in the game, the player must tune a radio to the [[frequency]] listed in the ad ([[AM broadcasting|AM]] 1170) in order to proceed.
