==Plot==
The death of an Arabian prince's father, the king, shatters three enchanted [[oil lamp]]s, freeing the three [[genie]]s trapped within.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!-- ad copy writer --> |year=1985 |title=''Master of the Lamps'' |journal=[[COMPUTE!'s Gazette]] |volume=3 |issue=7 |page=29 |url=http://www.commodore.ca/gallery/magazines/gazette/Compute-Gazette-Issue-25.pdf |issn=0737-3716 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> The genies overrun the palace; to contain them, the prince must reassemble the three broken lamps. The player, in the role of the prince wearing a white [[thawb]] and red [[keffiyeh]], must journey into the seven dens of each genie, as each den contains one of the lamp pieces.<ref name="manual">{{cite web |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-master-of-the-lamps_3175.html |title=''Master of the Lamps Instructions'' |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Atari Mania |accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://c64-games.blogspot.com/2009/11/master-of-lamps-manual.html |title=''Master of the Lamps'' manual |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=25 November 2009 |website=Commodore 64 Games |accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

[[Gameplay]] alternates between two modes. In the first, the prince maneuvers a [[flying carpet]] through a winding tunnel to a genie's den. In practice, this requires the player to direct the carpet over diamond-shaped gates as they appear; failure to do so returns the prince to the beginning of the tunnel.<ref name="manual" />

Once in the den, the second mode, the player strikes a gong thrice to summon the genie. The genie draws from a [[hookah]], and blows out a ball of smoke. From the smoke emerges a sequence of tones, which the player must repeat in a [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response pattern]]. In order to play a tone, the player must strike the corresponding [[gong]]. If the player strikes the incorrect gong, or strikes the correct gong too early, the genie's magic transports the prince to the beginning of the tunnel.<ref name="manual" />

In the seven dens of the first genie, each tone is audible, and manifests as a colored [[quaver]] (eighth note) that floats toward the ground. In the seven dens of the second genie, the tone is inaudible, so the player must match the color of the note to the color of the corresponding gong. In the seven dens of the third genie, the tone is audible, but no note appears; the player must recognize the note's [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], and strike the correct gong.<ref name="manual" /> When the player passes the trial, a gateway to another tunnel opens.

After passing the musical trials of the three genies, the player navigates one final tunnel to the palace.<ref name="manual" /> If the player succeeds, the prince reclaims the palace.

==Reception==
''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' in 1986 called ''Master of the Lamps'' an "offbeat game program with a number of unique elements". While stating that "it does become a little monotonous", the magazine approved of the non-violent gameplay.<ref name="antic198603">{{Cite magazine |last1=Moore |first1=Rich |last2=Plotkin |first2=David |last3=Kershaw |first3=Brad |last4=Lewis |first4=Scott |date=March 1986 |title=product reviews |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v4n11/productreviews.html |magazine=Antic}}</ref>
