[[File:Borrowed_Time_(video_game)_Atari_ST_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot (Atari ST)]]
''Borrowed Time'' is a text adventure with a complementary graphical user interface. Control is via the keyboard, alternatively, many commands and objects can be selected from a graphical menu with a joystick or a mouse. Moving around is done in the same way - a selection window with cardinal directions is available. The player must interrogate suspects and collect evidence at the various locations in order to achieve the game goal. Some game actions have a time limit for problem-solving.

== Development ==
''Borrowed Time'' was produced by Interplay for Activision and was part of a $100,000 contract that included a total of three adventure games.<ref name="demaria-2004">Rusel DeMaria, Johnny L. Wilson: ''High Score.'' McGraw-Hill/Osborne: Emeryville, California, 2004. Page 209. ISBN 0-07-223172-6</ref> Interplay founder Fargo already had experience in the adventure genre: his first game was the adventure [[The Demon's Forge]], released for [[Apple II]] in 1981. The parser used by Interplay was developed by Fargo and a collaborator, and at one stage of development had a dictionary of 250 nouns, 200 verbs, and could evaluate input with prepositions and indirect objects.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Computer Entertainment | title=if yr cmptr cn rd ths... | author=Shay Addams | year=1985 | pages=24 | url=http://www.vaxdungeon.com/Infocom/Articles/parser-war.asp| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121112618/http://www.vaxdungeon.com/Infocom/Articles/parser-war.asp | archive-date=2016-01-21 }}</ref> The same engine had been used in the previous games [[Mindshadow (video game)|Mindshadow]] and The Tracer Sanction. The writing and much of the game design were done by Subway Software, a company founded by game journalist [[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]] specifically for ''Borrowed Time''. Fargo outsourced the writing because he felt that no one at Interplay could produce quality prose.<ref name="da">{{cite web|title=Brian Fargo and Interplay|url=https://www.filfre.net/2015/05/brian-fargo-and-interplay/|last1=Maher|first1=Jimmy}}</ref>
