== Plot ==

== Gameplay ==
The game is half a maze and half a puzzle solver, with elements of a [[role-playing game]] (RPG). It is similar to titles such as ''[[Atic Atac]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gilbert|first=John|date=2013-11-01|title=Sinclair User 45 - Spectrum Software Scene|url=http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/045/sftwrea.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828195236/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/045/sftwrea.htm|archive-date=2013-08-28|access-date=2017-09-27|website=Sinclair User Classic}}</ref> It came packaged with a poem filled with clues that the player had to decipher to progress through the game.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_050_1985-12_EMAP_Publishing_GB|title=Computer & Video Games|date=December 1985|publisher=EMAP Publishing|location=GB|pages=29|issue=50}}</ref>

The player could only carry a limited number of items.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=December 1985|title=Your Spectrum - Joystick Duty - Issue 21|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr21/yr21_47.htm|access-date=2021-04-17|website=www.users.globalnet.co.uk}}</ref> A flask displayed on the top right of the screen indicated the player's energy level. If this ran out the game ended. If holding the correct object, it was possible to sleep and regain energy. This would move the timer on to the next day. The game had to be completed within a certain number of days.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1985|title=Riddler's Den - Manual|url=https://worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/r/RiddlersDen.txt|website=worldofspectrum.org}}</ref>

== Reception ==
[[Sinclair User]] magazine asserted that the game was easy to play, but difficult to master.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gilbert|first=John|url=https://archive.org/details/sinclair-user-magazine-045|title=Sinclair User Magazine Issue 045|date=December 1985|pages=25}}</ref> [[Your Spectrum]] magazine deemed the program both absorbing and frustrating due to its blending of two disparate genres: arcade and adventure.<ref name=":1" />
