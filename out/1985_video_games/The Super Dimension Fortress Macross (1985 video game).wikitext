{{nihongo|'''''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'''''|超時空要塞マクロス|Chō Jikū Yōsai Macross|}} was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in 1985 by video game company [[Namco]] and is based on the popular [[anime]] television series of the [[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross|same name]].<ref name="NES">[http://macross.anime.net//production/software/index.html Nintendo Family Computer System Compatible Cartridge Video Game. ''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross''. Instruction Booklet. NMR-4500. Namco/Bandai. Japan. Y4800. 1985, December 10]</ref> The game is a side-scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] in which the player controls a transformable [[VF-1 Valkyrie]] [[variable fighter]] in an unending battle against an invading race of [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] [[humanoid]] [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as the [[Zentradi]].<ref name="NES"/>

It is one of the earliest known collaborations between Namco and [[Bandai]], both of which would eventually merge into [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] in 2005.

== Gameplay ==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:FCMacross Title.jpg|thumb|left|Game title screen.]] -->

The gameplay is a very basic and fairly standard form of the recognizable style that has become part of the shoot-em-up genre over the years. The player's task is to blast their way through wave after wave of enemy [[mecha|battlepods]], [[powered exoskeleton|power armor]]s and ships until they reach the Zentradi mothership.<ref name="NES"/> Inside it, there is only thirty seconds to reach the central reactor, destroy the outer wall and shoot the core.<ref name="NES"/> The mission ends and then begins all over again on an [[infinite loop]].

The player's [[VF-1 Valkyrie]] can be transformed into three modes: [[VF-1 Valkyrie#GERWALK mode|Gerwalk]], Battroid and fighter.<ref name="NES"/> This adds to the gameplay as the Gerwalk and Battroid modes serve to progressively slow down the horizontal scrolling and make the game less difficult. However they also move slower. The controller's B button fires the Gun Pod while the A button - in conjunction with the movement of the D-pad - engages the transformation mode. A limited number of micro-missiles can be fired by pressing the Select button.

==Music==
The game's main background music is an 8-bit version of the [[Lynn Minmay (Macross)|Lynn Minmay]] song "''Shao Pai Long''" ("Little White Dragon"), which was featured in both the original [[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross|1982 TV series]] and its [[Macross: Do You Remember Love?|1984 movie adaptation]].
