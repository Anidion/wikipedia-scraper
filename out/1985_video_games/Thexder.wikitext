In ''Thexder'', the player controls a fighter robot that is able to transform into a jet and shoot lasers.

== Release ==
The game was originally released in 1985 for the [[NEC PC-8801]] platform in Japan. Game Arts licensed ''Thexder'' to [[Square (video game company)|Square]] in order to develop a conversion for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) game console. In 1987, Game Arts also developed a ''Thexder'' conversion for the [[MSX]] platform. The game was licensed to [[Sierra Entertainment]] for release in the United States. Sierra ported the game to multiple platforms, including the [[IBM PC]], [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Tandy Color Computer 3]], [[Apple II]], [[Apple IIGS]], [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]], and [[Tandy 1000]].

== Reception ==
''Thexder'' quickly became a [[List of best-selling PC games|best-selling hit]], selling over 500,000 copies in Japan by 1987.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=THEXDER Coming from Sierra |magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]] |date=August 1987 |volume=6 |issue=5 |page=1 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/newsletters/video_game_update/computer_entertainer_aug87.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Storer|first=Andy|title=Thexder|journal=[[ST/Amiga Format]]|date=July 1988|issue=1|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_17838|access-date=14 January 2012|page=55}}</ref> The PC-8801 platform was only popular in Japan and, despite home market success, ''Thexder'' garnered little attention abroad initially. With the conversion for the MSX (the best-selling platform in Brazil and many Eastern European countries), it became an international hit. It became the company's best-selling title of 1987.

'''''Thexder 2''''', also known as '''''Fire Hawk''''' and '''''Fire Hawk: Thexder – The Second Contact''''', was released in 1989 on MSX2 and 1990 on DOS. It retained the same concept as the original ''Thexder'' but added many improvements. The Fire Hawk robot had the same design as the Thexder: the main laser, shield, and ability to transform into a jet. It also had upgrades to allow it to launch guided missiles, and use special weapons found throughout the game. Obtaining special weapons caused a weapon carrier droid to be deployed, and if positioned correctly, would act as a shield against enemies. Graphics were improved from the original game, and gameplay was divided into sub-levels, with the fourth sub-level containing a "boss" enemy. It was also possible to restart later games at the beginning of a level previously visited.
