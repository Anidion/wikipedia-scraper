{{nihongo foot|'''''City Connection'''''|シティコネクション|Shiti Konekushon|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1985 [[platform game]] developed and published as an [[arcade video game]] by [[Jaleco]]. It was released in North America by Kitkorp as '''''Cruisin''''''. The player controls Clarice in her [[Honda City (AA)|Honda City hatchback]] and must drive over elevated roads to paint them. Clarice is pursued by police cars, which she can stun by hitting them with oil cans. The design was inspired by [[maze video game|maze chase]] games like ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980) and ''[[Make Trax]]'' (1981).

''City Connection'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[MSX]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. In Japan, the game has maintained a loyal following, and the NES version is seen as a classic for the platform. It was re-released in several Jaleco game collections and services such as the [[Wii Virtual Console]]. These received mixed responses in North America, with critics disliking its simplicity, lack of replay value, and poor controls. Some felt it possessed a cute aesthetic and unique concept and was entertaining. Clarice is one of the first female protagonists in a console game.

Jaleco released a sequel, ''City Connection Rocket'', for Japanese mobile phones in 2004.

''City Connection'' has maintained a loyal following in Japan, where it became one of Jaleco's most successful and beloved games.<ref name="Red Bull">{{cite web |last1=Totsuka |first1=Gichii |title=まずは｢『シティコネクション』なら大丈夫」と思われる必要があった─ジャレコゲーム"再復活"のキーマン |url=https://www.redbull.com/jp-ja/city-connection |website=[[Red Bull|Red Bull Japan]] |access-date=25 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126061620/https://www.redbull.com/jp-ja/city-connection |archive-date=26 November 2020 |language=ja |date=23 June 2016}}</ref><ref name="FCM">{{cite book |title=5月10日号特別付録 ファミコンロムカセット オールカタログ |date=10 May 1991 |publisher=[[Tokuma Shoten]] |page=72 |edition=Volume 7, Number 9 |language=ja}}</ref> The NES version, in particular, is viewed as a classic title on the system for its accurate portrayal of the arcade original.<ref name="Yuge"/> In 2003, ''Yuge'' listed it as being among the console's greatest games, through its unique gameplay, colorful visuals, and memorable soundtrack. The magazine staff described it as being a game that fulfills the dreams of children who want to play arcade games.<ref name="Yuge"/>

The NES version and its digital re-releases received mixed reviews in North America, by comparison. Critics focused largely on its overall simplicity and poor controls. A reviewer for ''Computer Entertainment US'' felt that the game was hindered by its lack of replay value for older players.<ref name="CEnt"/> ''[[IGN]]'' and ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' reviewers Lucas M.

Critics felt ''City Connection'', in spite of its flaws, possessed a cute aesthetic and unique gameplay. ''[[Computer Entertainer|Computer Entertainer US]]'' believed its cute visual style would appeal to younger players and its challenge to older ones, and said what little the game had to offer was enjoyable.<ref name="CEnt"/> Christopher Michael of ''[[AllGame]]'' likened its gameplay to ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and similar maze-chase arcade games from the era, writing that its graphics and gameplay made it a must-play for the platform.<ref name="Allgame"/> Reviewing for ''[[Eurogamer]]'', Dan Whitehead compared its gameplay to ''[[Q*Bert]]'' and its horizontal-scrolling to ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]'', and made for an addictive game that justified its price tag.<ref name="EuroG"/> Thomas and Duyn agreed that ''City Connection''{{'}}s gameplay was simplistic and enjoyable, though constrained by its controls and high difficulty.<ref name="IGN"/><ref name="NLife"/>
