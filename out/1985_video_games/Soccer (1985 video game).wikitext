It was released in Japan and North America in 1985, and in Europe in 1987. It was released for the [[Famicom Disk System]] in 1986. It was released on the [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] on June 12, 2014. It was released on [[Nintendo Switch Online]] in 2018.

==Gameplay==
As with real [[soccer]], the objective is to kick the ball into the opponent's goal. The game features [[cheerleaders]] and the option of 15, 30, and 45-minutes halves. Pressing B passes the ball, and A shoots at the opponent's goal.

Seven teams are represented: [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], [[Great Britain men's Olympic football team|Great Britain]], [[France national football team|France]], [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Japan national football team|Japan]], and [[Spain national football team|Spain]].

When beginning a game, the player chooses whether to play with one or two players. The single-player mode is against [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|the computer]] with five variable difficulty settings. The player chooses between seven teams and sets a time limit of either 15-, 30-, or 45-minute halves. Games begin in the center of a horizontal field, which pans from side to side with player activity. The player closest to the ball controls it and can kick the ball at the push of a button. An indicator over the closest teammate headed in the same direction as the player indicates who can receive a pass. Goal shots can be controlled with a small meter that represents the ball reaching over the goalie's head. Likewise, the player automatically controls the goalie when the opponent makes a goal shot.<ref name=CVG/>

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Vs. Soccer'' in its February 1, 1986, issue as being the nineteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=277|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=February 1, 1986|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said that though every console receives a soccer game, Nintendo's was among the best. They noted the game was somewhat slow and not very attractive, with sparse backgrounds and formless players, but that did not affect the fun. The magazine rated the game 83% overall, with 8/10 for playability and 6/10 for graphics and sound.<ref name=CVG/>
