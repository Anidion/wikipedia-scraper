'''''Lord of the Rings: Game One''''' (released in North America as '''''The Fellowship of the Ring: A Software Adventure''''') is a [[video game]] released in 1985 and based on the book ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. It was the follow-up to the 1982 game ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]]'', but did not reach the same level of critical success as its predecessor. It's generally considered inferior by the gaming community, with many{{who|date=September 2017}} complaining about the removal of the real-time aspects and complex AI patterns of the previous game, and puzzles that lacked coherent solutions. To promote the game, Melbourne House commissioned [[hologram]] picture of a [[Nazgûl]] from a company called Holographix.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=From Faluvian Empire to Sculpting in Light |journal=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |date=September 1985 |issue=October 1985 |pages=36–38}}</ref> It was available to purchase from Melbourne House directly using an order form on the instruction booklet included with the game.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Lord of the Rings: Game One |journal=Manual |date=1985 |pages=27–28}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Shadows of Mordor|Shadows of Mordor: Game Two of Lord of the Rings]]'', was released in 1987.

''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh versions of ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]]'', ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' and ''[[Shadows of Mordor|The Shadows of Mordor]]'' simultaneously, criticizing ''The Hobbit'', calling it "particularly clumsy" as it is "handicapped by a 400-word input vocabulary" as opposed to the latter two games' 800 words. ''Macworld'' calls ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' "particularly intricate" and recommends it as an entry point to the series as opposed to ''The Hobbit''. ''Macworld'' praises ''The Hobbit's'' graphics, but states that in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' and ''The Shadows of Mordor'' the art adds little to the games' overall appeal. Furthermore, ''Macworld'' heralds the three games as "literate and faithful in spirit to original books", but criticizes the dated and "rigid" nature of the text-adventure format.<ref>{{cite magazine|last = McCandless|first = Keith|title = New Hobbits For Old|date = May 1989|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_8905_May_1989/page/n219|magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|page = 209}}</ref>

According to Beam Software, the game was a commercial success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beam.com.au/beamhist.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970607090542/http://www.beam.com.au/beamhist.html|title=Beam Software History|website=beam.com.au|archivedate=June 7, 1997|accessdate=March 17, 2022}}</ref>
