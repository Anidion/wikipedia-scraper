'''''Alpha Mission''''', known as {{nihongo foot|'''''ASO: Armored Scrum Object'''''|エー・エス・オー - アーマード・スクラム・オブジェクト|Ē Esu Ō - Āmādo Sukuramu Obujekuto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} [[Video games in Japan|in Japan]], is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] developed by [[SNK]] and released as an [[arcade video game]] in 1985 by [[Namco]] in Japan and [[Tradewest]] in North America. It was later ported to the [[Famicom]] in 1986 and released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1987.

The arcade game was a commercial success in Japan, where it was the seventh highest-grossing table [[1986 in video games|arcade game of 1986]]. A sequel, ''[[Alpha Mission II]]'', was released for the [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo Geo]] arcade system in 1991.

==Gameplay==
''Alpha Mission'' is a one-player [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] game in its segregation of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons. [[Missile]]s are used to destroy ground enemies, while [[laser]]-like weapons are used for aerial opponents. Throughout each of the levels, the player must fight off waves of enemies that threaten several [[space station]]s and a boss must be defeated at the end of each. Like most early games in this genre, when the player dies, all weapons are lost and the player is moved to a point slightly before the point of death. The player's craft can also be upgraded to have more powerful weapons by picking up various [[power-up]]s throughout the level.

==Release==
''Alpha Mission'' was released on the [[PlayStation Portable]] as part of PSP Minis via [[PlayStation Store]] in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Says|first=Onmode-Ky|title=Alpha Mission Review—Finding Pleasure in Pain {{!}} PSP Minis|url=http://www.pspminis.com/7345/alpha-mission-review-finding-pleasure-in-pain/|access-date=2020-12-03|language=en|archive-date=2020-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607233404/http://www.pspminis.com/7345/alpha-mission-review-finding-pleasure-in-pain/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Alpha Mission (PSP Minis) Review for PSP (2011) - Defunct Games|url=http://www.defunctgames.com/courant/549/alpha-mission-psp-minis|access-date=2020-12-03|website=www.defunctgames.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Three SNK PSP Minis Reviewed|url=https://www.tech-gaming.com/three-snk-psp-minis-reviewed/|access-date=2020-12-03|website=www.tech-gaming.com|date=20 September 2011 }}</ref> ''Alpha Mission'' was also released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] in the [[Nintendo eShop]] on 25 October 2018 and on the [[PlayStation 4]] via PlayStation Store on 18 July 2019 by [[Hamster Corporation]] as part of their [[Arcade Archives]] series.<ref name="Aca">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/guide_every_arcade_archives_game_on_nintendo_switch_plus_our_top_picks|title=Guide: Every Arcade Archives Game On Nintendo Switch, Plus Our Top Picks|last=Lane|first=Gavin|date=2020-03-13|website=Nintendo Life|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=18 July 2019|title=Arcade Archives Alpha Mission PS4 HAMSTER Corporation|url=http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/arcadearchives/aso.htm|access-date=2020-12-03|website=www.hamster.co.jp}}</ref> The game is also included on ''[[SNK 40th Anniversary Collection]]'', the collection has both the original arcade and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SNK 40th ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION: ALPHA MISSION {{!}} OFFICIAL WEBSITE|url=https://snk40th.com/games.html?p=alpha|access-date=2020-12-03|website=snk40th.com}}</ref> It includes both the Japanese version and the Western/international version.
