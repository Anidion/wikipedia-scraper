'''''Mercenary''''' is a 3D [[action-adventure game]] written for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published by [[Novagen Software]] in 1985. It was converted to the [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], and [[Commodore 16|Commodore 16/116]]/[[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]]. The game uses [[vector graphics]] renderings of vast, sparse environments and has [[Sandbox (video games)|open-ended gameplay]]. It was also released as '''''Mercenary: Escape from Targ''''' and '''''Mercenary: A Flight Simulator Adventure'''''. 

''Mercenary'' was favourably reviewed and followed by two sequels: ''Damocles'' and ''Mercenary III: The Dion Crisis''.

==Plot==
Having crash-landed on the planet Targ (''en route'' to the Gamma System of ''Damocles''), the player's main objective is to find a means of escape.<ref name="eurogamer2014">{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-15-mercenary-retrospective |title=Mercenary retrospective |last=Coles |first=Tony |date=15 June 2014 |website=Eurogamer |publisher= |access-date=21 June 2019 |quote=}}</ref> There are several ways to achieve this end. A civil war between two factions, the Palyars (indigenous "good guys") and the Mechanoids (invading "bad guys"), affords the player an opportunity to earn money to buy their escape from Targ.

The player is accompanied and advised by Benson, a "9th generation [[personal computer|PC]]". This interaction is handled via a scrolling [[news ticker]] at the bottom of the display. As well as providing assistance to the player, much of the humour within the games comes from the occasional sarcastic remarks made by Benson.<ref name="damocles_CUA">{{cite journal|title=''Damocles'' Amiga review|journal=[[CU Amiga]]|date=November 1989|url=http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/damocles.htm#damoclescu|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603142332/http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/damocles.htm#damoclescu|archivedate=2007-06-03}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[image:Mercenary pic 2.gif|thumb|left|Bosher stadium (Atari ST)]]
The player explores a world rendered in realtime 3D graphics, completing a number of non-linear tasks in order to achieve a single main objective. The title of the series derives from the player's role in carrying out tasks as a "hired gun". The player is able to play the warring factions off against one another to the player's own advantage. For instance, each faction seeks the destruction of installations belonging to its rival, and the capture of material or other resources to support their cause. There are other routes to escape, and it is possible to combine strategies to both leave Targ and keep the wealth accrued there.

==''Mercenary: The Second City''==
[[image:Mercenary-the-second-city-on-atari-800-FAIR-USE.jpg|thumb|Scenery from ''The Second City'' (Atari 8-bit)]]
''Mercenary: The Second City'', released in 1986, is an [[expansion pack]]. Initially its major distinction is the new colour scheme, representing the other side of the planet. The ground is now red rather than the original green, and the sky is no longer blue. Instead, it is pink in the Amiga and Atari (8-bit and ST) versions,<ref name="atarimania">{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-mercenary-the-second-city_3323.html |title=Atari 400 800 XL XE Mercenary – The Second City: scans, dump, download, screenshots, ads, videos, catalog, instructions, roms |publisher=Atarimania.com |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref><ref name="atarimania2">{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-st-mercenary-compendium-edition_21212.html |title=Atari ST Mercenary – Compendium Edition: scans, dump, download, screenshots, ads, videos, catalog, instructions, roms |publisher=Atarimania.com |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref> dark blue on the Commodore 8-bit platforms (C64 and Plus/4)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gb64.com/oldsite/gameofweek/17/gotw_mercenarysecondcity.htm |title=gamebase64.com – The Gamebase Collection |publisher=Gb64.com |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commodore16.com/index.php/software/47-games/393-mercenary-compendium-.htm|title=Mercenary Compendium|accessdate=2014-02-16}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> and yellow on the ZX Spectrum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003128 |title=Mercenary: The Second City |publisher=World of Spectrum |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref>

However, after a similar objective, the substantive differences reveal themselves subtly: there is a different city layout, a more intricate underground complex, a new set of puzzles to overcome and several significant changes with game objects.

==Legacy==
===''Damocles''===
{{Main|Damocles (video game)}}
''Damocles'' (also advertised as ''Mercenary II'') is the second game in the series. It was released on the Atari ST and Amiga platforms in 1990. Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions were in development but cancelled. ''Damocles'' represents the game environment using filled polygon graphics. Two mission disks were released.

===''Mercenary III''===
{{Main|Mercenary III}}
''Mercenary III'' (also known as ''Mercenary III: The Dion Crisis'' or ''Damocles II'') is the third game in the series. It was released on the Atari ST and Amiga in 1992. This time the roads of the various cities are populated by vehicles such as [[taxicab|taxi]]s and [[bus]]es. Observation and attack spacecraft are present in the skies. Interaction with other characters is possible to a limited degree.

===Re-releases===
''Mercenary'' and ''The Second City'' were later combined into the ''Mercenary Compendium''.<ref name="atarimania2" />

In the 2000s, the three games were [[Porting|ported]] to [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was distributed with the agreement of the former Novagen team.<ref name="mddclone">{{cite web | url=http://mercenarysite.free.fr/mddclone.htm | title=Mercenary site, MDDClone section | publisher=Simon Guyart | accessdate=2011-02-25}}</ref> The program, called ''MDDClone'' ('''M'''ercenary, '''D'''amocles, '''D'''ion crisis '''Clone''') is [[freeware]], includes all three games, selectable through a [[drop-down list]]. The graphics and gameplay are identical to the Atari ST version, with the additional option to fix some bugs that were originally present.

Another port, focusing on the first game, was released in 2010. Called ''MDDClone-SDL'', this offers support for higher resolutions and texture mapping. Versions for Windows, [[OSX]], [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]] are available.<ref name="mddclonesdl">{{cite web | url=http://enderspace.de/mercenary/mddclone-sdl/ | title=MDDClone-SDL page | publisher=Szymon Ender | accessdate=2021-09-25}}</ref>

In 2018, an [[open source]] port of ''Damocles'' and ''Mercenary III'' was released. Called ''Mercenary Reloaded'', this port offers support for higher resolutions, a higher frame rate with smoother movements, [[virtual reality]] as per the specifications of the [[Oculus Rift]] [[head-mounted display]], and a separate side-by-side stereoscopic mode.<ref name="reloaded">{{cite web | url=http://mercenary.eversberg.eu/ | title=Mercenary Reloaded | publisher=Andreas Eversberg | accessdate=2021-09-25}}</ref>
