==Reception==
Gregg Pearlman for ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' said "The Temple of Apshai Trilogy is essentially an enjoyable game, among the most popular of its genre. Many of the elements are interesting and imaginative."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1987-05-anticmagazine/page/n63/mode/2up|title=Antic Magazine Volume 6 Number 01 (Fifth Anniversary)|date=May 24, 1987|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Ervin Bobo for ''[[Commodore Power/Play]]'' said "good games never die. They either become classics as they are, or are improved upon at a later date. The ''Temple of Apshai Trilogy'' proves they can do both."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-power-play-19/page/n35/mode/2up|title=Commodore Power Play Issue 19|date=February 24, 1986|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Patrick J. Kelley for ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' said "So, if you're the armchair-barbarian type, come on in. You have nothing to lose but . . ."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/analog-computing-magazine-40/page/n37/mode/2up|title=Analog Computing Magazine Issue 40 (Applications Issue)|date=March 24, 1986|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''Compute!'s Gazette'' in 1986 called ''Temple of Apshai Trilogy'' for the Commodore 64 "a classic series of computer games made even better", stating that improved graphics and game play made it worthwhile even for those who had played them before.<ref name="cg198601">{{Cite magazine |date=January 1986 |title=Temple Of Apshai Trilogy |url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-01-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_31_1986_Jan#page/n59/mode/2up |magazine=Compute's Gazette |pages=58–59}}</ref> ''[[Amiga World]]'' criticized the Amiga version of ''Trilogy''{{'}}s repetitiveness, stating that "unless you are very easily amused you will probably lose interest fairly soon".<ref name="amigaworld"/> Bill Kunkel, Arnie Katz and Joyce Worley for ''ANALOG Computing'', on the other hand, listed ''Trilogy'' as one of the best Atari ST games of 1986, lauded the improved graphics and interface, while asserting that "the actual content is timeless".<ref name="analogcomputing1986"/> In ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #114's "The Role of Computers" column in 1986, reviewers Hartley and Pattie Lesser also stated that the game was "well-worth your interest."<ref name="Dragon114">{{cite journal| title=The Role of Computers| author=Lesser, Hartley and Pattie| journal=Dragon| issue=114| date=October 1986| pages=72–76}}</ref> ''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'' gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, stating that the trilogy "has been admirably [[video game porting|Amiga-tized]]". The magazine approved of the graphics, sound, and user interface and concluded that the game would be "more likely to appeal to novices than Ultima".<ref name="info198701amiga">{{Cite magazine |last1=Dunnington |first1=Benn |last2=Brown |first2=Mark R. |last3=Malcolm |first3=Tom |date=January–February 1987 |title=Amiga Gallery |url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n89/mode/2up |magazine=Info |pages=90–95}}</ref>

Roy Wagner reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that " For simple exploring adventure and mapping this fills the need. It is a good introduction for beginning or younger players. There are no puzzles to solve."<ref name="CGW30">{{cite magazine |last= Wagner |first= Roy |title=Amiga Preferences |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=August 1986 |volume=1 |issue=30 |pages=26}}</ref>

Lee Hutchinson writing for [[Ars Technica]] recalled of the ''Trilogy'' set that "It seems like rather a thin experience, but I spent ''hours'' wandering through the three ''Temple'' adventures as a ludicrously overpowered adventurer. I certainly missed the main point of the game, but it was undeniably fun to wander around and bash monsters."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/growing-up-gaming-the-first-five-pc-games-i-ever-bought/|title=Growing up gaming: The first five PC games I ever bought|first=Lee|last=Hutchinson|date=June 26, 2015|website=Ars Technica}}</ref>
