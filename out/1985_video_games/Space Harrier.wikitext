{{nihongo foot|'''''Space Harrier'''''|スペースハリアー|Supēsu Hariā|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is a [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] arcade [[rail shooter]] game developed by [[Sega]] and released [[1985 in video gaming|in 1985]]. It was originally conceived as a realistic military-themed game played in the third-person perspective and featuring a player-controlled [[Fighter aircraft|fighter jet]], but technical and memory restrictions resulted in Sega developer [[Yu Suzuki]] redesigning it around a jet-propelled human character in a fantasy setting. The arcade game is controlled by an analog [[flight stick]] while the deluxe [[arcade cabinet]] is a cockpit-style [[linear actuator]] [[motion simulator]] cabinet that pitches and rolls during play, for which it is referred as a ''taikan'' (体感) or "body sensation" arcade game in Japan.

It was a commercial success in arcades, becoming one of Japan's top two highest-grossing upright/cockpit [[1986 in video games|arcade games of 1986]] (along with Sega's ''[[Hang-On]]'').<ref name="auto">{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '87 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=324 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=15 January 1988 |page=20 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19880115p.pdf#page=11}}</ref> Critically praised for its innovative graphics, gameplay and motion cabinet, ''Space Harrier'' is often ranked among Suzuki's best works. It has made several [[List of crossovers in video games|crossover appearances]] in other Sega titles, and inspired a number of clones and imitators, while [[Capcom]] and [[PlatinumGames]] director [[Hideki Kamiya]] cited it as an inspiration for his entering the [[video game industry]].

''Space Harrier'' has been [[Porting|ported]] to over twenty different [[home computer]] and [[Home video game console|gaming platforms]], either by Sega or outside developers such as Dempa in Japan and [[Elite Systems]] in North America and Europe. Two home-system sequels followed in ''[[Space Harrier 3-D]]'' and ''[[Space Harrier II]]'' (both released in 1988), and the arcade spin-off ''[[Planet Harriers]]'' (2000). A [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]-based remake of the original game was released by Sega for the [[PlayStation 2]] as part of their ''[[Sega Ages]]'' series in 2003.

Suzuki had little involvement with the game after its initial release: the [[Master System]] port was developed by Mutsuhiro Fujii and [[Yuji Naka]], and they added a final boss and an ending sequence which were included in subsequent ports. The game was too successful for Sega to abandon the series, and other Sega staff, such as [[Naoto Ohshima]] (character designer for ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''),  [[Kotaro Hayashida]] (planner of ''[[Alex Kidd in Miracle World]]''), and [[Toshihiro Nagoshi]] (director of ''[[Super Monkey Ball (video game)|Super Monkey Ball]]'') have had involvement in various sequels. In a 2015 interview, Suzuki said that he would have liked to create a new ''Space Harrier'' by himself, and was pleased to see it ported to the [[Nintendo 3DS]].<ref name=Making />

According to ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' magazine in 1991, Sega "arguably pioneered the deluxe ground-ride cabinet cum video game with classics such as" ''Space Harrier''. Sega went on to produce "bigger" and "better" motion simulator cabinets for arcade flight games such as ''[[After Burner]]'' (1987) and the [[R360]] cabinet for ''[[G-LOC: Air Battle]]'' (1990).<ref name="theone">{{cite magazine|title = Coin-Operated Corkers!|date = 28 January 1991|url = https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-29/page/n19|magazine = [[The One (magazine)|The One]]|publisher = [[EMAP Images]]|last = Nesbitt|first = Brian|issue = 29 (February 1991)|page = 20}}</ref>

[[Hideki Kamiya]], the director of [[PlatinumGames]] and creator of the ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series, cited ''Space Harrier'' as an inspiration for his entering the video game industry in a 2014 interview: "There were so many trend-setting definitive games that came out [in the 1980s], like ''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]'' and ''Space Harrier''.

Game composer [[Yuzo Koshiro]] was a fan of the game's music. He said ''Space Harrier'' was the first time he had heard [[FM synthesis]] music, and the game inspired him to become a [[video game music]] composer. He considers ''Space Harrier'' composer Hiroshi Kawaguchi to be one of Sega's best ever composers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yuzo Koshiro |url=https://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/yuzo-koshiro |access-date=15 October 2021 |work=[[Red Bull Music Academy]] |publisher=[[Red Bull GmbH]] |date=2019}}</ref>
