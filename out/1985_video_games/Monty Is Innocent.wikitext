'''''Monty Is Innocent''''' is a [[video game]] written by Chris Kerry for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and published by [[Gremlin Graphics]] in 1985. It is a sequel to ''[[Wanted: Monty Mole]]'' released the previous year. While the game was marketed as ''Monty Is Innocent'', it is never referred to by that title in-game; instead it merely displays '''''Great Escape!'''''. The inlay also features this title, on the newspaper that Monty Mole is reading in his cell.

While billed as a sequel to the game ''[[Wanted: Monty Mole]]'', ''Monty Is Innocent'' is very different; in addition to the obvious difference (the player controls Sam Stoat, rather than Monty) the previous Monty Mole game was a [[platform game]] whereas ''Monty Is Innocent'' is a linked, multi-screen 3D maze game. The player must collect a key from the Governor's office to open a cell door. There are eight keys (which open eight doors) and the player must return to the office each time until the key to open Monty's cell is found. A number of bottles containing a magic disappearing potion can be found around the prison, which will cause Sam to become invisible for a short time. There is also an armoury which contains an endless supply of guns, although the weapons have only five bullets each.

Points are scored for completing the game; the faster the game is completed, the more points are awarded.<ref name="Inlay" /><ref name="CRASH_Review">{{Citation|title=Monty Is Innocent Review|newspaper=[[Crash (magazine)|CRASH]]|date=March 1985}}</ref><ref name="YC_Review">{{Citation|title=Monty Is Innocent Review|newspaper=[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]|first=Paul|last=Bond|date=March 1985}}</ref><ref name="SP_Review">{{Citation|title=Monty Is Innocent Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair Programs]]|date=April 1985}}</ref><ref name="SU_Review">{{Citation|title=Monty Is Innocent Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|first=Clare|last=Edgeley|date=April 1985}}</ref>

Reviews were mixed, with ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' giving the game 78%<ref name="CRASH_Review" /> and ''[[Sinclair User]]'' awarding 7/10,<ref name="SU_Review" /> while ''[[Sinclair Programs]]'' gave only 40%.<ref name="SP_Review" />

''CRASH'' declared that "''Monty Is Innocent'' is great. It's really colourful and although the graphic movement is not ultra-smooth, it's okay",<ref name="CRASH_Review" /> and ''Your Computer'' said that "plenty of imagination has been used to create the backdrops - there are a couple of good 3D mazes and an ingenious sequence in a gymnasium".<ref name="YC_Review" /> ''Sinclair Programs'' said that, while the idea behind the game was good, it was "badly presented. Doors to other screens are often invisible, and the 3D pictures are confusing" and declaring that "the game is not a patch on ''[[Wanted: Monty Mole]]''".<ref name="SP_Review" />
