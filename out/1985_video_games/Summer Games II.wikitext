'''''Summer Games II''''' is an [[Olympic video games|Olympic]] [[sports video game]] developed and published by [[Epyx]] in North America, and published by [[U.S. Gold]] in Europe, based on sports featured in the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. It is a [[sequel]] to ''[[Summer Games (video game)|Summer Games]]'' released by Epyx the previous year. ''Summer Games II'' was originally written for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ported]] to the [[Apple II]], [[Atari ST]], [[MS-DOS]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Amiga]].

==Gameplay==
The game was presented as a virtual multi-sport carnival called the "Epyx Games" (there was no official [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] licensing in place) with up to 8 players each choosing a country to represent, and then taking turns competing in various events to try for a medal. World records could be saved to the game disk.

The game features the following eight events: [[Triple jump]], [[High jump]], [[Rowing at the Summer Olympics|Rowing]], [[Javelin throw]], [[Equestrianism|Equestrian]], [[Fencing at the Summer Olympics|Fencing]], [[Canoeing at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Kayaking]], [[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|Cycling]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-user-magazine-23/page/n33/mode/1up?view=theater|title = Commodore User Magazine Issue 23|date = August 1985}}</ref>

The game allows the player to compete in all of the events sequentially, compete in some events, choose just one event, or practice an event. This version also features both the opening and closing ceremonies, where the closing ceremonies features a "fan man", the flame extinguishing as the sky goes dark, a blimp passing by and some fireworks. Certain ports also allow for participants to compete in events from the original Summer Games events, but they had to have the original Summer Games diskette for this to happen.

''Summer Games II'' was Epyx's second best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987 after ''[[Winter Games (video game)|Winter Games]]''.<ref name="ferrell198712">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-12-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_54_1987_Dec#page/n17/mode/2up | title=The Commodore Games That Live On And On | work=Compute's Gazette | date=December 1987 | access-date=24 January 2015 | author=Ferrell, Keith | pages=18â€“22}}</ref> ''[[Ahoy!]]'' said that "the production values of ''Summer Games II'' are absolutely top of the line, even better than the original ''Summer Games''". The magazine cited equestrian and fencing as the best events, and concluded that it "covers itself with glory from the familiar opening ceremony to the closing festivities. Put simply, if you own a Commodore 64, this disk is a must".<ref name="kunkel198511">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_23_1985-11_Ion_International_US#page/n53/mode/2up | title=Summer Games II | work=Ahoy! | date=November 1985 | access-date=27 June 2014 | author=Kunkel, Bill | pages=49}}</ref>
