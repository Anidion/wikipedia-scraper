It is a spiritual successor to the 1983 arcade game ''[[Tag-Team Wrestling]]'', also developed by Technōs Japan, but published by [[Data East]]. The arcade game was a commercial success in Japan and North America, becoming the highest-grossing arcade [[1986 in video games|conversion kit of 1986]] in the United States.

An updated arcade version with a two-player competitive mode was released in 1986 as ''Mania Challenge''. [[Atari Corporation]] published an [[Atari 7800]] port in 1990 which includes features of both games and lacks others. ''Mat Mania'' was re-released for the [[PlayStation 4]] as part of the [[Arcade Archives]] collection in 2015<ref>[http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/03/22/the-drop-new-playstation-games-for-324/ /// Exciting Hour (2015)]</ref> and the [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2019.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Matmaniasnapshot.png|thumb|left|Arcade version, showing the player (left) vs Insane Warrior (right).]]
The game is presented in the guise of a televised pro-wrestling broadcast, the Taito Wrestling Association (TWA) (''Technos Wrestling Association'' in the Japanese version). The intro sequence and subsequent intermissions portray a disheveled pro-wrestling host, Cory (''Nari'' in the Japanese version). His hair is unkempt and his sleeves rolled up as he manically announces the particulars of the upcoming bout.

The player controls a [[wrestler]] who makes his way through the ranks of the TWA, challenging various thematically colorful opponents, before finally challenging the champion in the fifth match. Upon ascending to the championship, the player is presented with a [[championship belt]] in a presentation ceremony.<ref name="triv"/> The player must then defend his title against the previous five opponents, drawn at random.

==Characters==
===The Player/Dynamite Tommy===
The player-controlled [[Professional wrestling|wrestler]] was possibly modeled after [[The Dynamite Kid]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} Called simply "You" in ''Exciting Hour'' and ''Mat Mania'', he is dubbed Dynamite Tommy (the Dynamite Kid's real name is Tom Billington) in ''[[Mania Challenge]]''. However, there are signs held up in the crowd which read ''Fight Tommy'' and ''Tommy great'', and since all the challengers have a name, the name Tommy only could refer to the unnamed player's character. He sports shaggy brown hair and wears blue trunks and white boots. His assortment of [[Professional wrestling moves (disambiguation)|manoeuvres]] include: a punch and a high kick, and a shoulder block from a standing position; from a [[headlock]], an [[Professional wrestling throws#Irish whip|Irish whip]], a [[Professional wrestling throws#Scoop slam|body slam]], a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]], and a [[Suplex#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]]; upon a running opponent, a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]], an elbow smash, a [[Clothesline from hell|clothesline]] or a jumping back kick; upon a downed opponent, a running body splash, or, from a turnbuckle, a sunset flip or a knee drop. The player-controlled wrestler is fashioned after common "[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]" performers of the era.

===Insane Warrior===
Misspelt "Insane Worrier" in ''Exciting Hour''. He is fashioned after fanciful, dystopian [[Punk subculture|punk]]/barbarian themed performers popular during the 80s (most notably [[Road Warrior Animal]]).<ref name=triv/> Characteristically, he sports a [[Mohawk hairstyle]], loose-fitting black trousers and heavy [[make-up]]. Accordingly, his maneuvers are limited to unskilled [[Strike (attack)#Hammerfist|clubbing blows]] and a [[Gorilla Press Slam#Gorilla press slam|Gorilla Press body slam]] as his ultimate move. Also, unique from other opponents in that he [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pins]] the player-controlled [[wrestler]] using only one hand. He has the Player's Elbow Smash and [[Clothesline from hell|Clothesline]].

===Karate Fighter===
A [[martial arts]] themed [[wrestler]]. His silken, [[Manchu people|Manchu]] style trousers and [[slippers]] indicates something of a misnomer - [[Kung Fu|''Kung Fu Fighter'']] seems more appropriate. Typically his maneuvers include fast, kicking strikes, jump kicks, and [[knifehand strike|karate chops]] (used as a normal grasp and also as his finishing move). His hair is shaggy and covers his face, suggesting possible inspiration by [[The Great Kabuki]], [[Chopsocky]], or well-known martial artists such as [[Bruce Lee]] and [[Bolo Yeung]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} In the introductory sequence he is depicted with what would appear to be a set of [[nunchaku]], but this weapon is not used during actual game-play. He is the only opponent who does not possess any of the Player's moves. Karate Fighter's character concept was later adapted by Technos for the Chin Taimei character featured in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version of ''[[Double Dragon (video game)|Double Dragon]]''.

===Coco Savage===
Named "Coco Savege" in the game.<ref name=triv/> He is a [[Noble savage|''"Wild Man"'']] themed [[wrestler]], clearly inspired by [[Bobo Brazil]]. Depicted wearing a [[Leopard]] skin and [[barefoot]], he is unique from other opponents in that his attacking style is especially swift. He neither [[Punch (strike)|punch]]es nor [[kick]]s; rather, he is the only opponent to use the shoulder block, the same used by the Player. His unorthodox and unpredictable fighting style includes shoulder blocks, coconuts (punches to the head while in a headlock), a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Mongolian chop|Mongolian chop]] and [[Professional wrestling throws#Giant swing|giant swing throw]] as his finishing move, as well as a [[body splash]] on a downed opponent. He is quite possibly the most difficult opponent to beat in the game.

===The Pirania===
A [[Wrestling mask|masked]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|''"rúdo"'']] themed [[wrestler]] fashioned after [[Mil Mascaras]],<ref name=triv/> who often used a mask with a shark teeth design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://extreme-lucha.blogspot.com/2010/10/mil-mascaras-shark-by-xtreme-lucha.html|title=MIL MÁSCARAS SHARK by XTREME LUCHA|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/pictures/m/milmascaras/12.jpg|format=jpg|title=Masked Wrestler|access-date=2023-08-20}}</ref> Pirania uses illegal tactics, like [[choking]], and cheating to win his matches. He possesses the Player's [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]]. He also uses a [[Professional wrestling holds#Clawhold|Clawhold]], performed after whipping the Player off the ropes, which drops the Player to his knees almost immediately. Perhaps his most effective, and most humiliating, move involves suspending the Player above the mat by grabbing his hair with one hand, and illegally gouging him square in the eyes with the other. He also uses an [[Professional wrestling throws#Drops#Elbow Drop|elbow drop]] as his ultimate move.

===Golden Hulk===
Named "Blues Bloody" in ''Exciting Hour''. The TWA World Champion, who uses his strength and skill to overpower his opponent, clearly inspired by famed [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] star, [[Bruiser Brody]]. In some versions of the game, the world champion changed to more closely resemble [[Hulk Hogan]] to reflect the rise of Hogan's popularity, although the character's furry boots (a la Brody) remained intact. He was named as Golden Hulk in ''Mat Mania'' for the purposes of U.S. licensing, likely to exploit the popular appeal of Hulk Hogan in that market. He uses Hogan's "Legdrop of Doom" as a finisher, which Brody also used. He also has the Player's [[Professional wrestling throws#Scoop slam|body slam]] (performed one-armed - another homage to Brody) and Elbow Smash, plus a [[dropkick]], which the player's character later gained in ''Mania Challenge''.

==Ports ==
[[Atari Corporation]] released an [[Atari 7800]] version in 1990 as ''Mat Mania Challenge''.<ref name=man7800/> The company described it as a cross between ''Mat Mania'' and ''Mania Challenge'', as the game includes both Dynamite Tommy and Hurricane Joe from the latter game, but it also omits all of the villain characters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}} A port to [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was planned but never released.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}} A prototype was sold for a limited time by B&C ComputerVisions.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Exciting Hour'' was the highest-grossing table arcade unit of [[1985 in video games|October 1985]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=270|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 October 1985|page=25|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19851015p.pdf#page=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=270|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 November 1985|page=23|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19851101p.pdf#page=12}}</ref> In the United States, ''Mat Mania'' was the highest-grossing arcade [[1986 in video games|conversion kit of 1986]],<ref>{{cite magazine |title=AMOA JB, Games & Cig Vending Awards Winners |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=December 6, 1986 |page=30 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/80s/1986/CB-1986-12-06.pdf#page=54}}</ref>
and the year's third highest-grossing overall arcade game.<ref>{{cite news |title=Top 20 of 1986 |work=Top Score |date=July–August 1987 |publisher=Amusement Players Association |page=3 |url=http://www.videoparadise-sanjose.com/ts-3.htm}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Mania Challenge'' is an updated version of ''Mat Mania'' released in 1986, a year after the original. It adds a two-player competitive mode. The first player takes control of the main character from the original game, now named Dynamite Tommy, while the second player controls a new character named Hurricane Joe, who plays identically to Tommy. ''Mania Challenge'' also adds several countering techniques to the player's move set from ''Mat Mania'' such as countering a headlock with an atomic drop or a suplex, or throwing drop kicks. However, the character roster was reduced to only three opponents in the single player mode: the Insane Warrior, the Golden Hulk and the other player character controlled by the computer (Dynamite Tommy or Hurricane Joe), repeating those three opponents in subsequent loops.
