'''''T.A.N.K.''''' is a 1985 vertically scrolling [[multidirectional shooter]] developed and released in arcades by [[SNK]]. It was published in North America as '''''TNK III''''' by Kitcorp.<ref name="Akagi134">{{cite book |last1=Akagi |first1=Masumi |title=アーケードTVゲームリスト国内•海外編(1971-2005) |trans-title=Arcade TV Game List: Domestic • Overseas Edition (1971-2005) |date=13 October 2006 |publisher=Amusement News Agency |language=ja |location=Japan |isbn=978-4990251215 |page=134 |url=https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005/page/n135}}</ref> Versions of ''T.A.N.K.'' for [[home computers]] were released by [[Ocean Software]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1987. A sequel was also released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] titled ''[[Iron Tank]]''.

''T.A.N.K.'' features the first appearance of [[Ralf Jones]], predating his appearance in ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' (1986). ''T.A.N.K.'' also introduced [[rotary switch|rotary]] [[joystick]] controls. The game's lead designer was Koji Obada, who went on to design and direct SNK's arcade hit ''Ikari Warriors'', which popularized the rotary joystick controls introduced by ''T.A.N.K.''

==Gameplay==
''TNK III'' is a game in which the player uses a tank to destroy enemies using machine guns and cannons while maneuvering to the destination, and searching [[power-up]]s that can be retrieved along the way.<ref name="Dragon135"/>

The game is controlled using a rotary [[joystick]].<ref name="Continue"/> It is a type of joystick-knob hybrid, with an eight-directional joystick controlling the direction of the tank's movement, while it can be turned with 360-degree rotation to point the direction of the gun turret.<ref name="CVG"/>

==Development==
The game was developed by SNK, where it was designed and directed by Koji Obada, who previously designed ''[[Munch Mobile]]'' (''Joyful Road'' in Japan). At the time, SNK was on the verge of bankruptcy. According to Obata, their line of thinking was, "if we’re going to go bankrupt, let’s do something crazy and go out with a bang!" A programmer from SNK discovered [[Taito]]'s arcade shooter ''[[Front Line (video game)|Front Line]]'' (1982), and thought that SNK could go further with the gameplay format. The team improved on ''Front Line'' with the addition of a rotary joystick, or what they called a "loop lever" joystick. The team came up with the rotary joystick when, according to Obada, "our hands hurt, so someone got the idea to put a film capsule container over the joystick, which would spin around in place there".<ref name="Continue">{{cite magazine |title=「怒」を作った男 |trans-title=The Man Who Made "Ikari" |magazine=[[:ja:CONTINUE (雑誌)|Continue]] |date=March 2001 |lang=ja |url=http://shmuplations.com/snkgoldenage/}}</ref>

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''T.A.N.K.'' on their August 15, 1985 issue as being the sixth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=266|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 August 1985|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the arcade version of ''T.A.N.K.'' a positive review in January 1986, with praise for the "instantly playable" and "action-packed" gameplay as well as the rotary joystick controls, but they felt the graphics were dated.<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action: Tank |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 January 1986 |issue=52 (February 1986) |page=51 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/45/351}}</ref> Mike Roberts and Eric Doyle of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' magazine also gave the arcade game a positive review in early 1986, praising the "novel joystick" controls and comparing the gameplay favorably with [[Capcom]]'s [[Run and gun game|run-and-gun shooter]] ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'' (1985), stating it is "approaching that sort of quality".<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Roberts |first1=Mike |last2=Doyle |first2=Eric |title=Coin-Op Connection |magazine=[[Computer Gamer]] |date=February 1986 |issue=11 |pages=54–5 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_11_1986-02_Argus_Press_GB/page/n53/mode/2up}}</ref>

The Commodore 64 version of the game was reviewed in 1988 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #135 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon135">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk|journal=Dragon|issue=135|date=July 1988|pages=82–89}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The same year, Capcom's [[Run and gun game|run-and-gun shooter]] ''Commando'' was a major hit in arcades. Koji Obada went on to combine the run-and-gun shooter gameplay of ''Commando'' with the rotary joystick controls and tank vehicles of ''T.A.N.K.'' to develop ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' (1986), which became a major hit in arcades.<ref name="Continue"/>
