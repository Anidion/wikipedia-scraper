'''''Konami GT''''', originally known as '''''Konami RF2 - Red Fighter''''', is a 1985 [[racing video game]] developed and released by [[Konami]], using their [[Konami GX400|GX400]] [[Arcade video game|arcade]] architecture. The player drives a [[sports car]] which must reach various checkpoints without running out of fuel. A [[turbo]] mode (activated by the gear shift) increases the car's speed but uses more fuel and puts the player at a higher risk of hitting an obstacle. Fuel power-ups can be found on the road which the player must pick up to make it to the final checkpoint.

The original title '''''RF2''''' is a reference to Konami's 1984 arcade game ''[[Road Fighter]]'', and thus this may be considered an unofficial sequel. ''RF2'' was a commercial success in Japanese arcades. The series was followed in 1996 by official sequel ''Midnight Run - Road Fighter 2''.

''Konami GT'' was made available on [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] ''[[Game Room]]'' service for its [[Xbox 360]] console and for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows-based]] [[personal computer|PC]]s on October 6, 2010.

Mike Roberts of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' magazine reviewed "''Street Fighter II'' from Konami" following its appearance at London's Preview '86 show in late 1985, calling it "a fantastic sequel to the ''Street Fighter'' game". He said it was "a three dimensional racing game in the style of" ''[[Pole Position]]'' (1982) "but the quality of graphics and gameplay are in excess of anything that I have seen for a long time".<ref name="CG10">{{cite magazine |last1=Roberts |first1=Mike |last2=Doyle |first2=Eric |title=Coin-Op Connection |magazine=[[Computer Gamer]] |date=1985 |issue=10 (January 1986) |pages=26–7 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_10_1986-01_Argus_Press_GB/page/n25/mode/2up}}</ref>
