==Gameplay==
[[File:Silent_Service_Atari_8-bit_PAL_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Atari 8-bit gameplay]]
''Silent Service'' is set in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during [[World War II]], with the player assuming control of a U.S. [[Gato-class submarine|''Gato''-class]] [[submarine]] for various war patrols against Japanese shipping. "Silent Service" was a nickname for the [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s submarine force in the Pacific during World War II. The player can choose when to attack from a range of realistic tactics, including the [[End Around (submarine tactic)|End Around]] and near invisibility at night (if the sub's profile is kept to a minimum). It allows four projectiles concurrently, a challenge when battling multiple destroyers. Real-time is accelerated when not in combat.

Sid Meier described several key factors that influenced the design of the game: The size of the [[Theater (warfare)|theater]], the variety of tactical situations, and evolving technology, such as the use of surface radar and torpedoes that did or did not leave trails of bubbles on the surface&mdash;only simulations set after their real-life introduction had access to these. Tasks such as navigation, damage repair, and firing were compartmentalized into different screens to allow players access to a great deal of information, but also to focus on the immediate task.<ref name = "CGW">{{cite magazine | date = March 1986 | last = Meier | first = Sid | authorlink = Sid Meier | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Silent Service: Designer's Notes | pages = 28–29}}</ref>
