In order to complete the game, the player must collect every money bag which is strewn around the city-sized amusement park; even the money bags Are placed on precarious perches and in the middle of rides. In order to do this, gambles and risks will have to be taken. The player can also be killed instantaneously by some dangers. This can be caused by numerous careless acts such as jumping from a great height, getting [[skewered]] by an erratic [[turnstile]]. The player has ten lives. Once the protagonist has died ten times, the player loses and the game is over.

A 1985 review in ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' gave ''Roller Coaster'' a 94%.<ref name=crash24/>

Four years later, in a review of the budget re-release of ''Roller Coaster'',  ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' magazine wrote: "The emphasis in ''Roller Coaster'' is to have vast amounts of fun, and, boy, do you! Each screen is deviously devised, but not difficult to master once you get to grips with the gameplay. And the gameplay&mdash;it's so addictive! Don't hesitate to buy ''Roller Coaster''!"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Roller Coaster |journal=CRASH |date=July 1989 |issue=66 |page=43 |url=https://archive.org/stream/crash-magazine-66/Crash_66_Jul_1989#page/n43/mode/2up/search/Roller+Coaster}}</ref>

''Roller Coaster'' was reworked into the 1991 [[Game Boy]] title ''Dragon's Lair: The Legend'', with the game's plot and graphics amended in order to closer resemble those of the original ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'' [[coin-op]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=6&cId=3158520 | publisher=Ziff Davis | work=1up.com | title=Total Makeover: How some publishers drastically rework games for different audiences | access-date=2008-07-01 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012095713/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=6&cId=3158520 | archive-date=2007-10-12}}</ref> As less of the playing area was visible in the Game Boy port than in the Spectrum version, the display was effectively a window on each of the original version's screens, scrolling within each one and flicking to the next when the edge of the screen was reached.
