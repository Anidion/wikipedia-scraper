'''''Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar''''', first released in 1985<ref>(USCO# PA-317-504)</ref> for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], is the fourth in the series of ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' [[role-playing video game]]s. It is the first in the "Age of Enlightenment" trilogy, shifting the series from the [[hack and slash]], [[dungeon crawl]] gameplay of its "Age of Darkness" predecessors towards an ethically-nuanced, story-driven approach. ''Ultima IV'' has a much larger game world than its predecessors, with an overworld map sixteen times the size of ''[[Ultima III]]'' and puzzle-filled dungeon rooms to explore. ''Ultima IV'' further advances the franchise with dialog improvements, new means of travel and exploration, and world interactivity.

In 1996 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' named ''Ultima IV'' as #2 on its [[List of video games considered the best|Best Games of All Time]] list for IBM PC compatibles. Designer [[Richard Garriott]] considers this game to be among his favorites from the ''Ultima'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playtr.com/team/team_bios.html#biosTop|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823112249/http://www.playtr.com/team/team_bios.html#biosTop|archive-date=2007-08-23 |title=Tabula Rasa Team Bios: Richard Garriott |access-date=2006-09-19 |last=Garriott |first=Richard |publisher= NCSoft }}</ref>

''Ultima IV'' was followed by the release of ''[[Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny]]'' in 1988.

==Plot==
[[File:ultima4.gif|frame|left|''Ultima IV'' on the [[Commodore 64]].]]

''Ultima IV'' is among the few role-playing games, and perhaps the first, in which the game's story does not center on asking a [[player character]] to overcome a tangible [[Fantasy tropes#Good vs. evil|ultimate evil]].{{r|scorpia199408}}<ref name=maher20140711>{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2014/07/ultima-iv/ | title=Ultima IV | work=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2014-07-11 | access-date=11 July 2014 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref> The story instead focuses on the player character's moral self-improvement.<ref name=NGen39>{{cite magazine |title=The Ultima Time Line |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=39 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=March 1998|page=65}}</ref>

After the defeat of each of the members of the Triad of Evil in the previous three ''Ultima'' games, the world of [[Sosaria]] underwent some radical changes in geography:{{r|maher20140711}}<ref name="u4manual">{{cite book | publisher=Origin Systems | year=1985 | title=Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, The History of Britannia}}</ref> Three quarters of the world disappeared, continents rose and sank, and new cities were built to replace the ones that were lost. Eventually the world, now unified under [[Lord British]]'s rule, was renamed Britannia. Lord British felt the people lacked purpose after their great struggles against the Triad were over, and he was concerned with their spiritual well-being in this unfamiliar new age of relative peace, so he proclaimed the Quest of the Avatar: He needed someone to step forth and become the shining example for others to follow.

Unlike most other RPGs the game is not set in an "age of darkness"; prosperous Britannia resembles [[Renaissance Italy]], or [[King Arthur]]'s Camelot. The object of the game is to focus on the main character's development in [[virtue|virtuous]] life—possible because the land is at peace—and become a spiritual leader and an example to the people of the world of Britannia. The game follows the protagonist's struggle to understand and exercise the [[Virtues of Ultima|Eight Virtues]].{{r|maher20140707}} After proving his or her understanding in each of the Virtues, locating several artifacts and finally descending into the [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon]] called the [[Styx|Stygian]] [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]] to gain access to the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom, the protagonist becomes an [[Avatar (Ultima)|Avatar]].<ref name=NGen39/>

Conversely, actions in the game could remove a character's gained Virtues, distancing them from the construction of Truth, Love, Courage and the greater axiom of Infinity—all required to complete the game. Though Avatarhood is not exclusive to one chosen person, the hero remains the only known Avatar throughout the later games, and as time passes he is increasingly regarded as a myth.

==Gameplay==
Instead of simply choosing [[Statistic (role-playing games)|stats]] to assign points to as in the first three ''Ultima'' games, players are asked various ethical dilemmas by a gypsy fortune-teller using remotely [[tarot]]-like cards of the eight virtues.  These situations do not have one correct resolution; rather, players must rank the Eight Virtues and whichever stands as their highest priority determines the type of [[Character class|character]] they will play.{{r|scorpia199408}} For example, choosing Compassion creates a [[Bard]], Honor a [[Paladin (character class)|Paladin]], Sacrifice a [[Tinker]], and so on. This is also the first ''Ultima'' where playing as a human is necessary, eliminating other [[Character race|races]] such as the [[Elves in fiction|elves]], [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], and "bobbits" found in previous games (however, even in the first three ''Ultima''s where they could be chosen as player characters, there were never any [[non-player character]]s (NPC) of those non-human races).

Although each profession embodies a particular Virtue, to become an Avatar the player must achieve enlightenment in all eight virtues. Virtue affects how NPCs interact with the player;{{r|scorpia199408}} enlightenment in the Virtues is achieved through the player's actions as well as through meditation at shrines. Shrines to each of the Virtues are scattered about Britannia, each requiring the player to possess the corresponding Virtue's rune before allowing entry. Through meditation and correctly repeating the Virtue's mantra three times at the shrine, the player gains insight and ultimately enlightenment in the Virtue. The seer Hawkwind in Lord British's castle provides the player with feedback on their progress in the Virtues, offering advice for actions that will improve their standing in each of the Eight Virtues, informing them when they are ready to visit a shrine for elevation, or chastising the character if they "hath strayed far from the path of the Avatar".  A player may be encouraged to give alms to the poor to improve their Sacrifice, or never flee from battle to improve their Valor. Players are equally able to lower their virtue by their in-game actions, such as selecting a bragging response in a dialog with certain characters (lowers Humility).  While most actions have a minor effect on a Virtue's progress, certain actions can have an immediate and devastating effect on a player's progress on multiple Virtues.

Technically, the game was very similar to ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]'', although much larger. It is the first ''Ultima'' to feature a dynamic conversation system;<ref name=NGen39/> whereas NPCs in earlier games would only give one canned answer when talked to, now players could interact with them by specifying a subject of conversation, the subject determined either by a standard set of questions (name, job, health) or by information gleaned from the previous answers, or from other characters. Many sub-[[Quest (video games)|quest]]s were arranged around this. Users playing the game a second time could save considerable time by knowing the answers to key questions which frequently required travel to another city to talk with another NPC. In at least one case, a player is asked "Who sent you?", which may require yet another round trip between cities.

Another addition were dungeon rooms, uniquely designed combat areas in the dungeons which supplemented the standard combat against randomly appearing enemies.

''Ultima IV'' is an [[open world game]]; most quests can be completed in any order. There are no [[fetch quest]]s.{{r|scorpia199408}} Although it is a [[turn-based]] game, the clock runs while the game was running. If a player does not act for a while, NPCs and monsters may move and time passes. Time is an important aspect to the game, as certain actions can only be performed at certain times.

The world of Britannia was first introduced here in full, and the world map in the series did not greatly change in later games. The player may travel about Britannia by foot, on horseback, across the sea in a ship or by air in a "lighter than air device". Speed and ease of travel is affected by the mode of travel as well as terrain and wind.

===Virtues===
[[File:Ultima_codex_symbol.svg|thumb|Annotated approximation of the Codex symbol &ndash; the virtues (numbered) are associated with the principles (italics in shaded circles) they touch]]
The Eight Virtues of the Avatar, their relationship to the Three Principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, and how [[gameplay]] has been designed around them are as follows:
* '''Honesty:''' Truth<br/>When purchasing goods from blind merchants, the player is required to enter the amount of gold they wish to pay. Although the player has the option of paying less than the merchant has asked for, this will mark the player as dishonest. Stealing gold from chests in towns, villages and castles will also penalize the player. This Virtue is embodied by Mariah the Mage.
* '''Compassion:''' Love<br/>By using the ''Give'' conversation subject, a player can give beggars [[alms]] and in doing so demonstrate Compassion. This Virtue is embodied by Iolo the Bard.
* '''Valor:''' Courage<br/>Valor is displayed by the player defeating enemies in combat{{r|scorpia199408}} and not fleeing in a cowardly fashion. This means that when retreat is necessary, the player should be the last [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] member to leave the field of battle. This Virtue is embodied by Geoffrey the Fighter.
* '''Justice:''' Truth and Love<br/>Not all of the hostile creatures in Britannia are evil and the player must avoid unprovoked attacks on those that are not. If attacked, he should resort to driving them away rather than killing them. Out of the eight virtues, this one requires the most finesse to embody and is a particularly good example of balancing ethical dilemmas. The player's party must stand their ground for Valor, yet drive their foes away without killing them. This Virtue is embodied by Jaana the Druid.
* '''Sacrifice:''' Love and Courage<br/>If the player goes to a place of healing while in good [[Health (game terminology)|health]], the player can make a blood donation and sacrifice some health in doing so. One noted critic, [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] of ''[[Computer Gaming World]],'' reported that players who wrote her for hints had the most trouble with ''self''-sacrifice, believing that giving gold to others was sufficient, as opposed to donating blood. Helping others retreat from battle and losing Valor points is another way of increasing Sacrifice.{{r|scorpia199408}} This Virtue is embodied by Julia the Tinker. In the NES [[Porting|port]], she was replaced with a male character named Julius.
* '''Honor:''' Truth and Courage<br/>By finding sacred items and exploring dungeons the player demonstrates Honor. This Virtue is embodied by Dupre the Paladin.
* '''Spirituality:''' Truth, Love, and Courage<br/>Meditating at shrines, consulting the seer, and achieving enlightenment in the other Virtues enhances the player's Spirituality. This Virtue is embodied by Shamino the Ranger.
* '''Humility:''' None, though it is considered the root of all Virtue.<br/>The player demonstrates Humility during conversations. A boastful response to a question results in a penalty, while a humble response results in a bonus. This Virtue is embodied by Katrina the Shepherd.

==Development==
[[Richard Garriott]] has said that he received no customer feedback for his first three games because neither [[California Pacific Computer]] nor [[Sierra On-Line]] forwarded him mail. After his own company released ''Ultima III'', Garriott—who attended an interdenominational Christian [[Sunday School]] as a teenager—realized (partly from letters of enraged parents) that in the earlier games, immoral actions like stealing and murder of peaceful citizens had been necessary or at least very useful actions in order to win the game, and that such features might be objectionable.<ref name="maher20140707">{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2014/07/the-road-to-iv/ | title=The Road to IV | work=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2014-07-07 | access-date=11 July 2014 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref> Garriott said he wanted to become a good storyteller and make certain the story had content, and that 90% of the games out there, including his first three ''Ultima'' games, were what he called "go kill the evil bad guy" stories. He said, "''Ultima IV'' was the first one that had ethical overtones in it, and it also was just a better-told story."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uo.com/archive/ftp/text/intrview/richgar.txt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106134239/http://www.uo.com/archive/ftp/text/intrview/richgar.txt |archive-date=2009-01-06 }}</ref> Shay Addams, Garriott's official biographer, wrote, "He decided that if people were going to look for hidden meaning in his work when they didn't even exist, he would introduce ideas and symbols with meaning and significance he deemed worthwhile, to give them something they could really think about."<ref>The Official Book of Ultima by Shay Addams, page 39</ref> To encourage a sense of responsibility for their character's actions, players were intended to feel they were playing themselves transported into a fantasy realm, not a separate person.  Garriott removed gameplay elements he believed would prevent players from identifying personally with their character, such as playing as a non-human.<ref name=usgamer>{{cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-richard-garriott-got-players-to-start-thinking-about-the-choices-they-make-in-games|title=How Richard Garriott Got Players to Start Thinking About the Choices They Make in Ultima IV|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[USgamer]]|date=2017-09-15|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>

Decades after the game's release, [[1UP.com]] described ''Ultima IV'' as "a direct barb at the self-appointed moral crusaders who sought to demonize RPGs" and complained that "the irony in seeing an 'evil' RPG better present the [[Christian ethics|Christian]] admonition to back faith with works in quiet modesty than the [[Bible]]-waving watchdog decrying the medium seems to have been lost".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-31-ultima-iv|title=The Essential 100, No. 31: ''Ultima IV''|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|date=14 September 2012|work=[[1UP.com]]|access-date=8 December 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018144745/http://www.1up.com/features/essential-31-ultima-iv|archive-date=18 October 2012}}</ref>  The game's moral dilemmas were designed to give players the opportunity to reap temporary rewards for amoral behavior, only to realize later that they have been penalized.  Garriott hoped they would approach later dilemmas with more thoughtfulness.  Near the end of the game, he took advantage of this to encourage players to overthink the puzzles and question the morality of their choices.  At one point, players are seemingly required to murder children, who are revealed to be monsters in disguise.  Though one playtester threatened to quit over this dilemma, Garriott refused to remove it from the game, reasoning that it had served its purpose in provoking an emotional response.<ref name=usgamer/>

The game's concept originated from when Garriott was watching a [[television documentary]] about [[religion]] that covered the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and a [[Hindu temple]] in India.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Official Book Of Ultima |edition=second |date=1990 |pages=38–9 |url=https://archive.org/details/TheOfficialBookOfUltima/page/n50}}</ref> The concept of virtues was inspired by a TV show about the [[Avatar]]s of [[Hindu mythology]], which described the avatars as having to master 16 virtues. The eight virtues used in the game were derived from combinations of truth, love, and courage, a set of motivators Garriott found worked best, and also found in one of his favorite films, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. The game took two years to develop, twice that of both ''[[Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress|Ultima II]]'' and ''[[Ultima III: Exodus|Ultima III]]''. Garriott described the playtesting as "slightly rushed" to make the Christmas season; he was the only one to finish playing through the game by the time it went out for publishing.<ref name = "CGW">{{Cite news | date = March 1986 | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Inside Ultima IV | pages = 18–21 }}</ref>

Like contemporary Origin games, ''Ultima IV'' was developed for the [[Apple II series]], then [[porting|ported]] to other computers, partially because Garriott himself was an Apple II user/coder, partially because this made ports easier. Garriott said in 1984 that the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Atari 8-bit]]'s [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s and hardware sound chips made porting from them to Apple "far more difficult, perhaps even impossible ... the Apple version will never get done".<ref name="cgw198410">{{cite magazine | title=The CGW Computer Game Conference | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1984 | pages=30 | type=panel discussion}}</ref> Like previous games, ''Ultima IV'' does not permit saving in dungeons because of technical limitations that Garriott described as "non-trivial".{{r|CGW}}

The [[ankh]] used as the symbol of the Avatar's virtuous path, was chosen after Garriott saw it in the film ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/richardgarriott/status/784523163615068161|title=Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar. Ankh inspired by Logan's Run.|first=Richard|last=Garriott}}</ref>

Garriott said in a 1985 interview that he was working on both ''Ultima IV: Part 2'' and ''[[Ultima V]]''.{{r|CGW}} Eventually, only ''Ultima V'' realized.

==Versions==
===Apple II===
Like previous ''Ultima''s, Richard Garriott wrote most of the core code himself; however, as the games were getting too complex for one person to handle, he was required to call in outside assistance for programming tasks he was not familiar with, such as music and optimized disk routines. ''Ultima IV'' was the first game in the series to require a 64k Apple II and primarily targeted the newer [[Apple IIe]] and [[Apple IIc|IIc]], although it could still run on an [[Apple II+]] if a language card was used to boost the system to 64k (Garriott himself was still using a II+ at this time). As had happened with ''Ultima III'', ''Ultima IV'' also included support for the [[Mockingboard]] [[sound card]], which enabled Apple II users to have 3-voice music. Custom disk routines allowed ''Ultima IV'' to have faster disk access than the previous games, which was also important as the growing size of the game caused it to now use two [[floppy disk]]s instead of one.

The dialog of two NPCs in the Apple II release were accidentally not entered, leaving them in their default test states. One of these NPCs was the most elusive in the game, and provided the player with the final answer they would require to complete the game. With this character not responding properly, players were forced to guess the correct answer or find it from sources outside the game to complete it. This [[Software bug|bug]] would later be acknowledged in ''Ultima V'', where the NPC appears again and admits his mistake to the player.{{Cn|date=September 2022}}

===Commodore 64===
The [[Commodore 64]] port was the first in the series to take full advantage of the computer's hardware rather than simply converting the sound and graphics from the Apple II, and include in-game music. It came on two 1541 disks and like the Apple II, Side 1 of Disk 1 (labeled "Program") was [[Copy protection|copy protected]] while the other disk sides ("Overworld", "Town", and "Dungeon") were not and the user was instructed to make [[backup]]s of them. ''Ultima IV'' also added support for two [[disk drive]]s, in which case the user would keep the Overworld side of Disk 1 in Drive 0 and flip the Town/Dungeon disk as needed in Drive 1. The Overworld disk is also used to [[Saved game|load/save]] the player's progress. One of the biggest criticisms of the C64 port was a lack of any disk [[fast loader]], which made for extremely slow disk access against the speed-optimized disk routines in the Apple version.

===Atari 8-bit===
''Ultima IV'' was the final game in the series ported to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]]. To fit the game in 48K, the Atari 8-bit version dropped music support. 

The game was distributed on the earliest 90k Atari 810 disk format, so as not to require a disk drive upgrade for any players, thus it occupies four disks instead of two disks, as with the Apple II and Commodore 64 versions.

===IBM PC compatible===
Similar to the C64 port, the [[IBM]] version of ''Ultima IV'', released two years after the 8-bit versions, takes proper advantage of the hardware for the first time instead of being a rushed conversion from the Apple II. [[EGA graphics|EGA]] and [[Tandy graphics]] support is added, as well as proper hard disk support (the game finally supported [[DOS]] 2.x and subdirectories). However, there is no music in the IBM version even though the [[Tandy 1000]] series had a 3-voice [[sound chip]].

===Amiga and Atari ST===
The [[Atari ST]] version of ''Ultima IV'' was not released until 1987, and the [[Amiga]] version not until 1988. Both are extremely similar to the PC port and do not fully utilize their machines' respective hardware features. In particular, the Amiga version has only 16-color graphics although the Amiga could display 64 on screen, without using the Copper [[Processor (computing)|processor]] to make color palette changes. However, the Atari ST version does support [[MIDI]] for the music, so that one could play the music on a connected MIDI [[synthesizer]] or [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]. Both ports made use of the [[Computer mouse|mouse]] and limited use of the native [[operating system]]'s windowing environment ([[mouse cursor]] support, [[dialog box]]es for requesting disks, etc.).

===NES===
[[File:NES Ultima 4.png|frame|''Ultima IV'' on the NES]]

Like ''[[Ultima III]]'', ''Ultima IV'' was released to [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] by [[Fujisankei Communications International|FCI]] and [[Pony Canyon]]. This version, titled ''Ultima: Quest of the Avatar'', was released in 1990.

The NES port of ''Ultima IV'' is very different from the other versions: the graphics had been completely redone, as was the music, and the dialogue options were greatly reduced. Among other gameplay changes, the player cannot have all seven recruitable characters in the player's party at the same time, as one could in other versions. Any character over the four the player could have would stay at a hostel at Castle Britannia, requiring the player to return there to change characters. However, the combat system was fairly close to the [[personal computer]] games, with the additional option to use automated combat. Additionally the [[Incantation|spell-casting]] was simplified, removing the need to mix spells. Some [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]] were removed as well. This port also replaced the character Julia the Tinker with a male character named Julius. Some of these changes were done because of the [[Computer memory|memory]] limitations of being on a single [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] instead of multiple floppy diskettes.

===Master System===
''Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar'' for the [[Master System]] is the only ''Ultima'' to be ported to a [[Sega]] platform. It was released in 1990 and was both ported and published by Sega. The port features completely re-drawn graphics (although unlike the NES port, the style was retained from Origin's version), a simpler conversation system and, unlike the NES version, uses the regular ''Ultima IV'' background music. Although the Master System is easily capable of displaying more complex first-person scenes than those found in ''Ultima IV'' (see ''[[Phantasy Star (video game)|Phantasy Star]]''), this version's dungeons are viewed from a top-down perspective, much like those of ''[[Ultima VI]]'', which was released the same year. It seems that most of these cartridges were produced for the European market, as they contain a multi-lingual (English, French and German) manual, both books from the original version as well as a folded paper map. The books were of different colour for each of the three editions (blue for the UK version), fully translated and did not fit inside the game's box. There is a graphical error in this version where the gypsy's picture is of a man with a mustache even though the gypsy is referred to as "she" throughout the text.

xu4 is a cross-platform [[game engine recreation]] of ''Ultima IV'' under development for [[Dreamcast]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[RISC OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-ultima-iv|title=Classic.1up.com's Essential 50: 21.

He praised ''Ultima IV'' as "incredible. If you can find it in a store, don’t pass it up...
