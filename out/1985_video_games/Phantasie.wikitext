'''''Phantasie''''' is the first video game in the ''[[Phantasie (series)|Phantasie]]'' series.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Phantasie1.gif|250px|thumb|left|Screenshot]]
Based on the Isle of Gelnor, ''Phantasie'' allows a group of six characters to adventure the countryside and try to defeat the evil Black Knights and their [[Sorcerer (person)|sorcerer]] leader, Nikademus. Players could choose to be one of six character classes ([[Thief (character class)|Thief]], [[Fighter (character class)|Fighter]], [[Ranger (character class)|Ranger]], [[Monk (character class)|Monk]], [[Cleric (character class)|Priest]], and [[Wizard (character class)|Wizard]]) and could also choose between the races of [[Human]], [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]], [[Halfling]], [[Elf#Fantasy elves|Elf]], or [[Gnome]]. By selecting "Random" one could also choose from [[ogre]], [[troll]], [[pixie]], gnoll, orc, lizard man, minotaur, and other races.

The game was notable for taking advantage of a broad mix of styles for the game: a town window which allowed purchasing in various shops, a top-down style [[dungeon crawl]] view, a top-down world map, and a separate combat window. Each character class had unique fighting styles and options and all characters could choose their strategy for a particular round in the [[turn-based]] combat segments. After a combat, experience was awarded, but the players would have to return to town to purchase their levels if they qualified.

==Reception==

==Development==
When interviewed about the inspiration of the game Wood stated "I had played [[Wizardry|Wizardy]] and [[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]. They convinced me that computers were ideal for RPG’s. I also played [[Dungeons & Dragons|D&D]] and another tabletop game called [[RuneQuest]]. The basic mechanics of combat and character development were inspired by RuneQuest."<ref>https://rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=8786</ref>

Wood also discussed the inspiration behind the character of Nikademus, "I had certainly read [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] and studied [[Greek mythology]] and culture. I had also read [[The Chronicles of Narnia]] and other fantasy novels. I didn’t intentionally try to draw from any one source; I just used elements that I liked. I felt that I succeeded on the whole. The way these elements came together to create the worlds of Phantasie was one of its strengths. Nicodemus was a character from the book [[Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH]]. I thought it sounded like a great bad-guy name but I realized it was also the name of a Biblical character. I felt I should change the spelling and thus my character became Nikademus."<ref>https://rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=8786</ref>
