'''''Mail Order Monsters''''' is an action-strategy [[computer game]] created by [[Paul Reiche III]], Evan Robinson, and [[Nicky Robinson (game programmer)|Nicky Robinson]].  It was published by [[Electronic Arts]] ([[Ariolasoft]] in  Europe) for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1985, then released for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] in 1986.<ref name=fond>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/01/23/fond-memories-mail-order-monsters|title=Fond Memories: Mail Order Monsters|last=Buchanan|first=Levi|work=[[IGN]]|date=2009-01-23|accessdate=2015-12-05}}</ref>  Players create monsters which they can use to battle multiplayer or against computer-controlled opponents.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:Mail Order Monsters.jpg|left|thumb|Customizing a monster]]

The players create a variety of monsters and equip them with futuristic and modern weapons to do battle. Monsters can be further customized through buying special abilities, such as adding tentacles to use advanced weaponry.  Two players can fight against each other, play [[capture the flag]], or compete for a high score against a computer-controlled horde.  In single-player mode, the computer controls an opponent to fight.  Battles take place on various different maps that can have tactical effects, such as mountains for agile monsters to hide behind during combat.  Monsters can be stored on [[diskette]] and can be upgraded by victories against other monsters or computer opponents.<ref name=fond/>

==Development==
Reiche had previously worked with designers [[Jon Freeman (game designer)|Jon Freeman]] and [[Anne Westfall]] of [[Free Fall Associates]] on the game ''[[Archon: The Light and the Dark|Archon]]'' for [[Electronic Arts|EA]].  The game was originally envisioned as dark and gritty, but Electronic Arts demanded a more whimsical style.<ref>{{cite book|title=Honoring the Code: Conversations with Great Game Designers|last=Barton|first=Matt|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2013|isbn=9781466567542|page=210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UV7OBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA210}}</ref> During this development, Reiche became fascinated with his friend [[Greg Johnson (game designer)|Greg Johnson]]'s development on ''[[Starflight]]'', and spent a few weeks consulting on it before he realized he was "supposed to be working on ''Mail Order Monsters''".<ref name = "GDC2015">{{ cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Napx0MjivCM | title = Classic Game Postmortem: Star Control | author = Fred Ford & Paul Reiche III | publisher = [[Game Developers Conference]] | date = 2015-06-30 }}</ref>

== Reception ==
''[[Ahoy!]]'' stated that ''Mail Order Monsters'' was a "very good game" that did not reach "true excellence" because of insufficient combat tactics, and suggested that it was best for younger players.<ref name="katz198511">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_23_1985-11_Ion_International_US#page/n47/mode/2up | title=Call to Adventure / Role-Playing Software for the Commodore 64 | work=Ahoy! | date=November 1985 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Katz, Arnie | pages=49}}</ref>  Writing in ''Vintage Games'', Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton identify it as a precursor to the ''[[Pok√©mon]]'' series.<ref>{{cite book|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|last1=Loguidice|first1=Bill|last2=Barton|first2=Matt|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2012|isbn=9781136137587|page=326|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKF5AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA326}}</ref>

In a retrospective, Levi Buchanan of [[IGN]] said that although he would love to see a remake, any new version, updated to suit modern gamers, would necessarily have to diverge from what made the game unique in 1985.<ref name=fond/>
