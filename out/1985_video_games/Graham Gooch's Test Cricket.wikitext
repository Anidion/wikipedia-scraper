'''''Graham Gooch's Test Cricket''''' is a 1985 cricket game released for the [[Acorn Electron]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] by [[Audiogenic]]. It was later reissued by budget label ''Alternative Software'' as ''Graham Gooch's Match Cricket''.

==Gameplay==
''Graham Gooch's Test Cricket'' has two modes of play, arcade and [[simulation]].
*'''Arcade mode''' is for one player where the player picks the type of match and the players. During the match the player controls the action. When batting the player can move the [[batsman]] around the [[Crease (cricket)|crease]] and choose the shot to play. Timing is important to performing the shot successfully.
*'''Simulation mode''' is where the player can make tactical decisions but the actual play is done by the computer. The player can only watch the game, and make decisions on how his team plays.

==Reception==
At the time of release, ''Graham Gooch's Test Cricket'' was considered the most accurate cricket game out by reviewers. It received high scores for gameplay and graphics but lower scores for the sound, which is because it consisted of basic and few sound effects.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamebase64.com/oldsite/gameofweek/5/gotw_ggtestcricket.htm | title=''Graham Gooch's Test Cricket'' Commodore 64 review | work=[[Zzap!64]] | publisher=[[Newsfield Publications Ltd]] | date=September 1985 | accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> Spectrum magazine ''[[Crash (magazine)|CRASH]]'' rated the game 65% and commented that it is the "best cricket simulation yet on the spectrum".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue25/Pages/Crash2500013.jpg | title=''Graham Gooch's Test Cricket'' Spectrum review | work=[[Crash (magazine)|CRASH]] | publisher=[[Europress]] | date=February 1986 | accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> ''Graham Gooch's Test Cricket'' was rated poorly by [[Your Sinclair]] magazine, scoring just three out of ten.
