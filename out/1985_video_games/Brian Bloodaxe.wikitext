'''''Brian Bloodaxe''''' is a British [[platform game]] written by Charles Bystram for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and released by [[Edge Games|The Edge]] in 1985. It was ported to the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC 464]] by Trevor Inns.

==Plot==
In ''Brian Bloodaxe'', a [[Viking]] hero named Brian Bloodaxe wakes from an ice block in which he has been trapped for hundreds of years.<ref name=crash>{{cite magazine | date=March 1985 | title = Brian Bloodaxe review | work=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] | publisher=Newsfield | issue=14 | page=116 | url=https://archive.org/details/crash-magazine-14/page/n115 | access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref> Upon discovering that the year is now 1983 he decides to do what he originally set out to achieve â€” the conquering of Britain. Working his way through more than 100 screens of platform mayhem, Brian's ultimate goal is to steal the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] and seat himself upon the British throne.

==Gameplay==
''Brian Bloodaxe'' plays as a platform game with some simple "collect and drop objects" aspects. Although Brian has to dodge most of the game's varied and often surreal enemies, some of them can be killed either by headbutting them thereby stabbing them with the horns of his helmet, or using weapon objects found in the game - axe, bomb and pistol.

The game is notable for its esoteric humour which was strongly influenced by the humour of sketch comedy series ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', its in-game music (The "[[Liberty Bell (march)|Liberty Bell March]]" by [[John Philip Sousa]], better known to most as the ''Flying Circus'' theme tune), and colourful graphics.

==Reception==
The game polarised critics on different platforms. It impressed many, scoring 86% in ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'',<ref name=crash /> 3 out of 3 "hits" in ''[[Your Spectrum]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | date=April 1985 | title = Brian Bloodaxe review | journal=Your Spectrum | issue=13 | page=45 | url=https://archive.org/details/your-spectrum-magazine-13/page/n45 | access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref> and 8/10 in ''[[Sinclair User]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | date=April 1985 | title = Brian Bloodaxe review | journal=Sinclair User | issue=37 | page=26 | url=https://archive.org/details/sinclair-user-magazine-037/page/n25 | access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref> but ''Zzap!64'' were unimpressed by the Commodore 64 conversion which they felt had not been altered sufficiently from the original version to take advantage of the machine's technical abilities. It was awarded an 18% overall rating and described as "very disappointing".<ref name=zzap>{{Cite magazine|magazine=[[ZZap!64]]|publisher=Newsfield|date=August 1985|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=4&page=99|issue=4|page=99|title = Brian Bloodaxe review}}</ref>
