'''''The Worm in Paradise''''' is the third and final [[video game]] in the ''[[Silicon Dreams]]'' trilogy, a series of [[text adventure]] games in which the player takes the role of Kim Kimberly. It is the sequel to ''[[Snowball (game)|Snowball]]'' and ''[[Return to Eden (game)|Return to Eden]]''. ''Worm in Paradise'' takes place generations after the first two games, when the planet Eden has been colonised. The player is an ordinary citizen in Eden's most populous city, Enoch. The game was noteworthy for having significant social commentary relative to other games of the same genre and era. The game drew inspiration from the novel ''[[1984 (novel)|1984]]''.

==Plot==
A hundred years after the arrival of colonists aboard the ''Snowball 9'', planet Eden has become home to half a billion people. In this paradise managed by robots there is not any crime, taxes, unemployment, or freedom. The population lives in a domed "megapolis", and, perhaps due to the war that occurred during ''Return to Eden'', there is not any contact between the cities and the surrounding natural world. The occasional sighting of [[flying saucer]]s keeps the population afraid to go outside.

The main character, a nameless citizen of Enoch, starts the game in a beautiful garden where everything seems fine. He picks an apple from a tree, a worm pops out, and the player follows it outside the garden, through the desert, and then he awakens. It was only a simulation, one of the many forms of entertainment available during the reign of the third Kim.  This "Garden of Eden as a prison" allegory sets the mood for the entire game. The objective is to explore the city, and while doing so the player must gather clues to unmask the government conspiracy behind the flying saucers.

==Development==
The Worm in Paradise is the third and final instalment of the Silicon Dreams trilogy and is a departure from the previous games. It "evolved alongside a 12 month enhancement on Level 9's own adventure system. Standard features include a 1,000 word vocabulary, a very highly-advanced English input, memory-enhancing text compression, the now familiar and very much appreciated [[type-ahead]], and [[Computer multitasking|multi-tasking]] so a player need never wait while a picture is drawn."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Brewster | first = Derek |date=March 1986 | title = The Worm in Paradise | journal = [[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]] | issue = 26 | pages = 91–92 | url = http://www.crashonline.org.uk/26/worm.htm | access-date = 2007-10-07}}</ref>  This was the first game using version 3 of the A-Code system.<ref name="thenextlevel_part1">{{cite journal | last = Hewison | first = Richard |date=July 2004 | title = The Next Level - part 1 | journal = [[Retro Gamer]] | publisher = Live Publishing| issue = 6 | pages = 53–57}}</ref> It was released for four fewer platforms, excluding the Lynx, Memotech MTX, Nascom and Oric-1 compared to the two previous releases.<ref name="Adventureland">{{cite web | last = Meier | first = Stefan |author2=Persson, Hans  | url = http://adventure.if-legends.org/Level_9_Computing.html | title = Level 9 Computing | access-date = 2008-07-20 | work = Adventureland}}</ref>

Another difference is that the player has only seven days, within the game's clock, to complete the game. Quests are also time-based and require that the player arrive at certain locations at specific hours to achieve the desired goal. And while game play remains the same, the backdrop is no longer an action adventure, but a [[political thriller]] that resembles the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.  Similar to what happened when ''Snowball'' was released, there was certain confusion about the main character's identity and the time when the story is set. The ''Level 9 Fact Sheet'' says: "...a couple of years later, Kim Kimberley has become a legend on Eden."<ref name="factsheet">{{cite web |last = Schmidt | first = Miron |author2=Schulz, Manuel  | date = 1999-01-25 | url = http://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/level9/info/Level9_Facts.txt | title = Level 9 Fact Sheet | access-date = 2007-10-08 | work = The Interactive Fiction Archive}}</ref> Another article stated: "Worm in Paradise is set 100 years later.

John Ransley for ''[[Commodore User]]'' said "You'd have to spend an evening with a Roget's Thesaurus to come up with enough superlatives to do justice to ''The Worm in Paradise''; it not offers stunning (albeit it at times disturbing) originality in the overworked realm of science fiction but also embodies state-of-the-art programming techniques which will allow you effortlessly to give full rein to your powers of creative deduction – and there are always those 200 or more colourful graphics to visually help you along the way."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Commodore_User_Magazine_Issue_028/page/44/mode/2up|title=Commodore User Magazine Issue 028|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Keith Campbell for ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said "Here is science-fiction-based political saga which you can just sit back and enjoy, or, if you prefer, involve yourself at a more challenging level in an attempt to reach the seat of power and save the world.

Roger Garrett for ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' said "Even the more experienced player, who has a certain amount of knowledge about Level 9 games, will find it quite taxing but definitely rewarding.

''[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]'' said "This latest text and graphics masterpiece has all the splendid qualities we've come to expect of Level 9 – masses of locations with a colourful fast-drawn picture for every one of them (except BBC B versions), type-ahead ability (no waiting for text or picture to be completed on screen), a massive vocabulary, advanced command parser, lashings of rich prose, a plethora of puzzles, and a plot lovingly crafted, and beautifully executed."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/your-computer-magazine-1986-02/page/n41/mode/2up|title=Your Computer Magazine (February 1986)|date=February 11, 1986|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
