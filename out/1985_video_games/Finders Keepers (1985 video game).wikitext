==Plot==
Magic Knight has been sent to the Castle of Spriteland by the King of Ibsisima in order to find a special present for Princess Germintrude. If Magic Knight is successful in his quest, he may have proved himself worthy of joining the famous "Polygon Table", a reference to the mythical [[Round Table]] from the legends of [[King Arthur]].

==Gameplay==
The hero starts in the King's [[throne room]] and is transported, via a teleporter, to the castle. The castle is made up of two types of playing area: [[flip-screen|flick-screen]] rooms in the manner of a platform game and two large scrolling mazes. On the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and MSX these are "Cold Upper Maze" and the "Slimey Lower Maze"; on the Commodore 64 they consist of "The Castle Gardens" and "The Castle Dungeons".

An additional aspect of the gameplay is the ability to collect objects (found in both the rooms and the mazes) scattered around the castle and sell them for money. Some of these objects can combine or react to create an object of higher value (for example, the bar of lead and the philosopher's stone react to create a bar of gold). Both the amount of money Magic Knight is carrying and the market value of his inventory are displayed on-screen. The buying and selling of objects is done with the various [[trade]]rs who live in the castle.

The Castle of Spriteland is full of dangerous creatures who inhabit its many rooms as well as both of its mazes and collision with these saps Magic Knight's strength. If he loses all his strength then he loses one of his four lives.

==Reception==
''Zzap!64'' were impressed by the game which was described as a "little masterpiece" and "another quality product from Mastertronic." It was given a 90% overall rating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=005&page=037&magazine=zzap|title = Redirecting}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Finders Keepers'' was followed-up by three more Magic Knight games: ''[[Spellbound (video game)|Spellbound]]'' (1985), ''[[Knight Tyme]]'' (1986), and ''[[Stormbringer (video game)|Stormbringer]]'' (1987). They are primarily [[graphic adventure]]s with a few platform elements.
