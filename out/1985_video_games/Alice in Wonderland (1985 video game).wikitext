'''''Alice in Wonderland''''' is a [[graphic adventure game]] developed by Dale Disharoon and published by [[Windham Classics]] for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]] in 1985.
It was remade for the [[Philips CD-I]].

Loosely adapted from ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', it is a platform adventure game in which Alice goes down the rabbit hole to Wonderland only to discover she must escape before the Red King awakens, ending the dream of Wonderland and the world behind the Looking Glass, and Alice along with them. Rounding out the cast are characters from ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', another nonsensical work by [[Lewis Carroll]]. Also appearing is the Wasp in a Wig, a character featuring in a deleted chapter from ''Through the Looking-Glass.''

It uses the same engine as Dale Disharoon's previous game for Windham Classics, ''[[Below the Root (video game)|Below the Root]]''.
