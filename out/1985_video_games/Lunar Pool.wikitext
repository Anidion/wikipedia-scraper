}}'''''Lunar Pool''''' (known as {{nihongo|'''''Lunar Ball'''''|ルナーボール|Runā Bōru}} in [[Japan]]) is a [[Sports video game|sports]] [[video game]]. It was developed in 1985 by [[Compile (company)|Compile]] for the NEC [[PC-8000 series]] (in Japan), the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES, in Japan, North America, and Europe), and the [[MSX]] (in Japan), and re-released for the [[Wii]] on the North American [[Virtual Console]] on October 22, 2007. The game combines [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] (pocket billiards) with aspects of [[miniature golf]]. The object is to use a {{cuegloss|cue ball}} to knock each {{cuegloss|object ball}} into one of the {{cuegloss|pocket}}s on [[pool table]]s of various shapes. The game offers sixty levels, and the friction of the table is adjustable. ''Lunar Pool'' was distributed by [[Pony Canyon]] in Japan and [[Fujisankei Communications International]] in North America.

==Gameplay==
''Lunar Pool'' is played on virtual pool tables of different shapes, some with obstacles within them. The player must shoot the cue ball to knock other colored object balls into the pockets. One [[Life (video games)|life]] is lost whenever the player either fails to pocket an object ball on three consecutive shots or pockets the cue ball. Completing a level awards one extra life, or two if the player has pocketed at least one ball on every shot.

The value of each ball is determined by its number and the displayed "Rate" value, which starts at 1 and increases after every shot in which the player pockets at least one ball. Failing to do so resets the Rate to 1. Bonus points are awarded for completing a level without a miss.

The game ends after all lives are lost or 60 levels have been completed, whichever occurs first.

==Modes==
''Lunar Pool'' can either be played alone, against another player, or against the computer. If the game is played against another player or the computer, players take turns shooting the cue ball. If one player fails to knock at least one of the colored balls into a pocket, or pockets the cue ball, then it becomes the opponent's turn.

The game includes an adjustable [[friction]] setting, which determines the rate at which balls slow down after being hit, as if affected by different amounts of [[gravity]] (thus the ''lunar'' reference in the title, along with [[Moon]]-related background imagery within the game).

==Cultural references==
