==Reception==

''Crash'', a ZX Spectrum gaming magazine, gave ''Benny Hill's Madcap Chase'' a positive review and awarded it 78%. Amongst the features the reviewers liked were the large graphics which avoided [[attribute clash]], and the sense of humour with one reviewer stating that they "[loved] it when Benny hit something or the lady chasing him had a fit". The game was described as "playable" and "addictive" although there were concerns about its long-term appeal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue26/Pages/Crash2600134.jpg|title = Crash}}</ref>

Rick Robson, writing in ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' magazine was less positive, awarding it a score of 6/10, stating that "True Hill fans will lament the absence of Hills Angels and the risky jokes but if you prefer being chased to chaste, this is the one for you, poor soul".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/bennyhill.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221142737/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/bennyhill.htm |archive-date=21 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
