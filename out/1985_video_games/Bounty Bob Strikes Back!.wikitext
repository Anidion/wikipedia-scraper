'''''Bounty Bob Strikes Back!''''' is the sequel to ''[[Miner 2049er]]'' published in 1985 <ref name="analogces" /> for [[Atari 8-bit computers]]. The game adds a pseudo-3D look to the platforms and increases the level count from 10 to 25. As with the original, the Atari 8-bit version was released on ROM cartridge.<ref>{{cite magazine |editor-last=Friedland |editor-first=Nat |title=New Products |date=May 1985 |url=https://archive.org/details/1985-05-anticmagazine/page/n89 |magazine=Antic |publisher=Antic Publishing |location=San Francisco, CA |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=90 |issn=0745-2527 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> A port for the [[Atari 5200]] was released the same year, followed by versions for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] also in 1985.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay is similar to ''Miner 2049er'' in that the player must inspect every section of 25 mines while avoiding mutants within a set time. One difference from the original game is that after losing a life, sections on platforms remain covered and destroyed enemies do not reappear, thus making it easier to complete a level.

==Development==
Following the critical and financial success of his game ''[[Miner 2049er]]'', programmer Bill Hogue began work on a game titled ''Scraper Caper'' which would have Bounty Bob become a fire fighter. Following a lot of advertising, the game was never released. Hogue would work on his next game ''Bounty Bob Strikes Back''.{{sfn|Hawken|Jones|p=37}}

The game featured enhancements from the first game, such as a slight 3D effect on the platforms to add dpeth and that when the player loses a life, they did not lose all the progress in their gameplay.{{sfn|Hawken|Jones|p=37}} The game also expanded on the amount of levels, having 25 over the originals 10.{{sfn|Hawken|Jones|p=38}}

On Atari systems, it is a [[Bank switching|bank-switched]] cartridge of 40KB total program and data [[Memory map|mapped]] onto 16KB of [[address space]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/atari800/atari800/blob/dc68c7ff6d6d9c7fa6a9574766cc83ad626c553b/DOC/cart.txt#L366 |title=Atari800 emulator supported cartridge images |last=Stehlik |first=Petr |website=[[GitHub]] |date=2023-04-29 |access-date=2023-06-11}}</ref><ref name="analogces" />

The game was shown at the January 1985 [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] and then in April 1985 ads began appearing in magazines.<ref name="analogces" />

==Reception==
The game reached number nine on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s list of top-selling entertainment computer software in June 1985,<ref>{{cite news |author=Billboard Publications |editor-last=Borg |editor-first=Donald G |date=2 June 1985 |title=Software best sellers |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/28341077/software_best_sellers_by_billboard/ |newspaper=The Record |publisher=John Borg |location=Hackensack, NJ |volume=90 |issue=305 |page=O-11 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> despite clocking in at a hefty {{Inflation|US|49.95|1985|fmt=eq|orig=yes}}.<ref name="analogces" />

In Steve Panak's column for ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'', he found the large number of screens and the different elements in them to be a strong point: "It is this variety which saves ''Bob'' from mediocrity."<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Panak |first1=Steve |title=Panak Strikes |journal=ANALOG Computing |date=June 1985 |issue=31 |page=68 |url=https://archive.org/details/analog-computing-magazine-31/page/n69/mode/2up}}</ref> He didn't like the unskippable animations when a new entry is added to the high score table, especially as the scores only persist until the computer is turned off.

In the final issue of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'', the ZX Spectrum version was ranked number 56 on "The Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time."<ref>{{cite magazine |editor-last=Nash |editor-first=Dennis |date=September 1993 |title=Let the People Decide!

==Legacy==
On reflecting on the sequel, Hogue said he thought it was a great follow-up to the original game, but "perhaps not the groundbreaking game we wanted it to be and I guess that still disappoints me."{{sfn|Hawken|Jones|p=37}}
