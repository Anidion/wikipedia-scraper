'''''Sega Ninja''''', originally released as {{nihongo foot|'''''Ninja Princess'''''|忍者プリンセス|Ninja Purinsesu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan, is a [[run and gun video game]] released in arcades by [[Sega]] in 1985. The game features Princess Kurumi (くるみ姫 ''Kurumi-Hime''), the titular [[female ninja]], battling enemies using [[kunai|throwing knives]] and [[shuriken|throwing stars]].<ref name="rainemu">{{cite web | title=Sega Ninja/Ninja Princess | publisher=Emulation Status | url=http://emustatus.rainemu.com/games/seganinja.htm | accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> The game was originally released in arcades as ''Ninja Princess'' in Japan and ''Sega Ninja'' internationally. In contrast to most later games in the genre, ''Ninja Princess'' has a [[feudal Japan]] setting with a female ninja protagonist who throws [[shuriken]] and knives.<ref name="HG101"/>

A revised edition for the [[Sega Mark III]] console titled ''Ninja Princess 1 Mega Ban - Ninja'' (忍者プリンセス1メガ版 忍者) was released in 1986, replacing the female protagonist with a male [[ninja]] protagonist who has to rescue her. This version was subsequently released as '''''The Ninja''''' for the [[Master System]] internationally.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Seganinja.png|thumb|left|Screenshot]]

''Ninja Princess'' is a [[run and gun video game]].<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Derboo |first1=Sam |title=Ninja Princess |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ninja-princess/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=September 12, 2017 |access-date=6 June 2021}}</ref><ref name=ugo/> The gameplay involves player shooting enemies and defeating [[boss (video games)|bosses]] along the way. Enemies include [[samurai]], [[ninja]] and dogs. The player's normal weapons are an unlimited supply of throwing knives, but [[power-up]]s to throwing stars are available; in addition, the player can also turn [[invisibility|invisible]] for a short period of time. While most of the stages are vertically scrolling, a few of the levels add some variety - including a level where the player must scale a wall.<ref name="rainemu" /><ref name=ugo/>

==Plot==
The game is set during Japan's [[Edo period]], in about the year 1630, in a province called Ohkami in the western region, where the power has been seized by an evil tyrant named Gyokuro. The goal is to end his oppressive rule and restore peace.

==Release==

Ports of the game were released for Sega's [[SG-1000]] and [[Master System]] consoles. The latter version, retitled ''Ninja Princess 1 Mega Ban - Ninja'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.arcade-gear.com/Games/Ninja_Princess/Ninja_Princess.htm |title=www.jap-sai.com - Ninja Princess |access-date=2013-12-21 |archive-date=2013-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003110205/http://www.arcade-gear.com/Games/Ninja_Princess/Ninja_Princess.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> was released a year after the arcade game and changed the protagonist from female to male.<ref name=ugo>[http://www.ugo.com/games/ninjas-in-games-top-11 Ninjas in Games | An evolution of ninjas in video games throughout the years.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615192317/http://www.ugo.com/games/ninjas-in-games-top-11 |date=2011-06-15 }}, UGO.com, June 4, 2008</ref> Other changes include the rearranging of stages from the original Japanese release in western releases of the game as well as a [[scroll]] system, which requires that five green scrolls must be collected to get to the final level of the game, as all of them give hints on how the final level must be entered. If the player finishes the game without them, the game will backtrack to a level closest to where a missing scroll lies.<ref name="klov">{{cite web | title=Sega Ninja | publisher=Coin-Op Museum | url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9473 | accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> Graphics are also different, made in a more realistic style.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]'' listed ''Ninja Princess'' on their [[1985 in video games|May 1, 1985]] issue as being the most-successful [[table arcade cabinet]] of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=259|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 May 1985|page=21|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19850501p.pdf#page=11}}</ref>

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that the Master System version was the most entertaining of three martial-arts games that Sega released together (the others were ''[[Black Belt (1986 video game)|Black Belt]]'' and ''[[Kung Fu Kid]]''), and approved of its unusual visual perspective.<ref name="cgw198810">{{cite magazine | title=Video Gaming World | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1988 |author1=Worley, Joyce |author2=Kunkel, Bill |author3=Katz, Arnie | page=48}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 2017, Sam Derboo of ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' noted that ''Ninja Princess'' predates [[Capcom]]'s genre-popularizing run-and-gun shooter ''[[Commando (arcade game)|Commando]]'' (1985), and he considers ''Ninja Princess'' to be "in some ways the more advanced concept." While he considered ''Commando'' to be a refinement of [[Taito]]'s ''[[Front Line (video game)|Front Line]]'' (1982), he said that ''Ninja Princess'' brought "a fresh setting and interesting new elements." He also praises the female protagonist, but criticizes the console versions for making the protagonist a male ninja who has to rescue her instead. He nevertheless considers it "no doubt one of the better overhead run-n-gun shooters out in the mid-’80s."<ref name="HG101"/>

''Sega Ninja'' is a plot point in the novel ''[[Ready Player Two]]'' (2020).
