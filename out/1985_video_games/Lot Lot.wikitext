Tokuma Shoten published the game on home platforms, including the Famicom.

The player controls one arrow and has to move some [[Pelletizing|pellets]] (which resemble [[pachinko]] balls) from the upper cells (with a four-second delay) to the lower ones without having to confront an evil [[crab]]. He will grab the player's pellets and try to prevent the player from scoring with them by cutting the [[Rubber band|elastic]]. The crab is forced to leave the board if there are no pellets for him to find.
