==Plot==
F.O.G. HQ has been given an ultimatum: either give 200&nbsp;billion dollars to the Federation of Evil, or the free world will be destroyed. It is up to Captain Roscoe “Buzz” Goodnight to destroy the doomsday device before it can be activated.<ref name="mobygames"/><ref name="google"/> The hero, Captain Goodnight, is a cross between "[[Biggles]], [[James Bond]] and [[Richard Hannay|Hannay]]".<ref name="callapple">{{cite web|url=http://apple2.callapple.org/magazines/aar/bestgames.html|title=Apple II - The Best Of Games Article Reprint|publisher=apple2.callapple.org|accessdate=2016-05-29}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
After a short briefing, Captain Goodnight is dropped off at an airfield where he begins his journey to find and destroy Doctor Maybe's Doomsday machine.  The player has 24 in-game hours to accomplish this, represented by a timer that counts down from 24 "hours" at a rate of one minute every realtime second, though an in-game cheat could be used to give the player 100 "hours", making it virtually impossible to  lose.
Along the way, Goodnight encounters various enemy vehicles and robots.  Being hit by any of these will knock Goodnight down, but he simply dusts himself off and jumps back into the fray, meaning the player has effectively unlimited lives.  However, each time this happens, one hour is deducted from the timer.  If the timer reaches zero before Goodnight can destroy the Doomsday machine, Maybe activates it, destroying the world and ending the game in failure.

==Development==
The game was designed to be "loaded with humor".<ref name="wordpress">{{cite web|url=https://extralives.wordpress.com/2008/03/15/captain-goodnight-lives/|title=Captain Goodnight lives &#124; World 1-1|date=16 March 2008 |publisher=extralives.wordpress.com|accessdate=2016-05-29}}</ref>
