{{nihongo foot|'''''Terra Cresta'''''|テラクレスタ|Tera Kuresuta|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] [[arcade video game]] released by [[Nichibutsu]] in 1985. The player controls a flying craft to destroy the Mandler army before they destroy all of humanity. Gameplay involves shooting enemies and collecting different ship parts that each provide their own unique weapon, such as a wave gun or a double shot. It is the sequel to the 1980 fixed shooter ''[[Moon Cresta]]'', Nichibutsu's first big hit in arcades and the second installment of the ''Cresta'' Series.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Terra Cresta screenshot.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]
The player controls the "Wing Galibur" fighter craft and must shoot down the incoming enemy craft in the air and on the ground. 

The game uses a unique powerup system: small capsules appear on the ground. Once the player has shot all of them down, the game awards the player with a piece that attaches onto the Wing Galibur. Four different pieces are available to give the Wing Galibur extra firepower and wider shots. They also act as shields, giving the player extra hits before they die. Should the player add all pieces to the ship and press the "transform" button, the Wing Galibur will transform into an invulnerable flaming phoenix for a brief period of time.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10077 | title = Terra Cresta - Videogame by Nihon Bussan}}</ref> Additionally, the player can press the transform button without all pieces to cause the pieces to split from the Wing Galibur and move into a triangular shape around the player. While separated, the pieces are invulnerable to all enemy fire, while the main ship is not. If the player is hit while separated, the Wing Galibur will revert to a singular craft.

==Conversions==
''Terra Cresta'' was ported to several home systems. European publisher [[Ocean Software]] published conversions for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]] on their ''Imagine Software'' label, while Nichibutsu themselves published a version for the [[Family Computer]] in Japan. The Famicom release was later published in North America for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Vic Tokai]]; it features a few alterations from the Japanese version, such as a remade soundtrack and the ability to customize the position of the player's ships when they separate from formation.<ref name="HG101"/> In 1992, Japanese developer Dempa ported both ''Terra Cresta'' and its predecessor ''[[Moon Cresta]]'' to the [[Sharp X68000]] as the debut title in their ''Video Game Anthology'' line of arcade game re-releases, titled ''Video Game Anthology Vol. 1 - Moon Cresta / Terra Cresta''.

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Terra Cresta'' on their October 15, 1985 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=270|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 October 1985|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>

In a 2016 retrospective review, ''[[Hardcore Gaming 101]]'' compared the game to ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' in terms of taking concepts established in its predecessor and expanding on it while adding its own unique ideas alongside.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Ragan |first1=Jess |title=Terra Cresta |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/terra-cresta/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=29 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121081231/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/terra-cresta/ |archive-date=21 November 2019 |date=9 July 2016}}</ref> They greatly praised ''Terra Cresta'' for its unique power-up system in particular, namely the ability to split the different ships apart for a short while, and favorably compared the gameplay itself to ''[[Xevious]]'' for its design and challenge, alongside its several nods to Japanese science-fiction shows and mecha.<ref name="HG101"/> ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' also praised Kenji Yoshida's arcade soundtrack, which used the [[Yamaha YM3526]] [[sound chip]], as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System version's soundtrack for being an improvement over the Japanese Family Computer version's score.<ref name="HG101"/> In their coverage of the series in 2016, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' magazine liked the game's enhancements over titles like ''Xevious'', alongside its "then-contemporary" power-up system.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mason |first1=Graeme |title=The Definitive Moon Cresta |agency=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=175 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |date=30 November 2018 |location=United Kingdom |pages=38–43}}</ref>
