'''''Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy''''' (''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'') is a 1985 [[Czech language|Czech text]] [[adventure game]] for [[ZX Spectrum]] computers and compatible hardware. It was authored by [[František Fuka]]. Two sequels were later produced entitled '''''Indiana Jones II''''' (1987) and '''''Indiana Jones III''''' (1990). The trilogy was later released in 1992 by Proxima Software as part of the Fuxoft brand "Fuxoft uvádí".

A continuation of the series was seen with the 1990 release of ''Indiana Jones a zlatá soška Keltů'', programmed by Jiří Fencl. Fencl also wrote a text adventure named ''Tom Jones''. Due to the series' success, the games were ported to other eight-bit home [[microcomputer]]s by various authors, sometimes containing only text and sometimes with graphics.<ref name="auto">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.root.cz/clanky/historie-vyvoje-pocitacovych-her-136-cast-ceske-textovky-iii/|title=Historie vývoje počítačových her (136. část – české textovky III)|first=Pavel|last=Tišnovský|publisher=|magazine=Root.cz|issn=1212-8309}}</ref>

==Production==
František Fuka created ''Poklad'' and ''Poklad 2'' in the early 1980s, and these served as a warmup before the designer began making more sophisticated games;
his first major project was ''Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.root.cz/clanky/historie-vyvoje-pocitacovych-her-134-cast-ceske-textovky-ii/?ic=serial-box&icc=text-title#k02|title=Historie vývoje počítačových her (134. část – české textovky II)|first=Pavel|last=Tišnovský|publisher=|magazine=Root.cz|issn=1212-8309}}</ref> He invented the game during a holiday in [[Romania]], despite him not having seen the movie it was based on.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zx-spectrum.cz/index.php?cat1=4&cat2=2&article_id=interview1.txt|title=ZX-Spectrum Games|first=Pavel|last=Plíva|website=www.zx-spectrum.cz}}</ref> After the movie [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]] was available in cinemas in Czechoslovakia, Fuka was surprised that the Czech title was also ''Indiana Jones a chrám zkázy'', because in his opinion the English name of the movie has different meaning.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Rozhovor s autorom - František Fuka|author=-yves-|publisher=|magazine=Bit|issn=1210-0242|page=38|year=1991|issue=10}}</ref> ''[[Indiana Jones 2|Indiana Jones II]]'' was released as a free sequel in 1987. It was notable for allowing the player to control the menu, which despite slow rendering and item selection was exceptional for the industry.<ref name="auto"/> Fuka promoted the title as "the first Czech text game with only three buttons".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://herniarcheolog.blogspot.com.au/2017/09/hra-114-indiana-jones-2-1987.html|title=Herní Archeolog: Hra 114: Indiana Jones 2 (1987)|last=Ugraugra|publisher=}}</ref> ''[[Indiana Jones 3|Indiana Jones III]]'' was notable for using a non-standard font upon its release in 1990, which allowed František Fuka to circumvent the display limitations of thirty-two characters per line.<ref name="auto"/> The title contained eight spaces for game saves, which was above that of foreign commercial products.<ref name="auto"/>

===Plot and gameplay===
The three games are [[video game]] adaptions of the first three [[Indiana Jones]] films. They play as text adventure games controlled by keyboard commands. There are over 30 locations in ''Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy'', and the player can die in ten of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://herniarcheolog.blogspot.com.au/2017/03/hra-7-indiana-jones-chram-zkazy-1985.html|title=Herní Archeolog: Hra 7: Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy (1985)|last=Ugraugra|year=2017 |publisher=}}</ref>

===Reception===
Root.cz deemed ''Indiana Jones II'' easier than the first title,<ref name="auto"/> and deemed ''Indiana Jones III'' the best of the trilogy.<ref name="auto"/>

Textovky.cz deemed František Fuka a legend within the Czech video gaming industry, and noted that the Indiana Jones trilogy includes three of the five games that gave him this status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.textovky.cz/clanky/nekolik-zastaveni-ve-zlatych-casech-aneb-ceske-textovky-pro-zx-spectrum-1-dil/|title=Několik zastavení ve Zlatých časech aneb České textovky pro ZX Spectrum (1. díl) - Články - TEXTOVKY.CZ - archiv textových her|website=www.textovky.cz|date=29 May 2020 }}</ref>
