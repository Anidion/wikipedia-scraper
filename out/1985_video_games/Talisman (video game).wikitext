'''''Talisman''''' (also called '''''The Talisman''''') was released in 1985 for [[ZX Spectrum]], developed by SLUG and published by [[Games Workshop]]. The game is a conversion of the [[Talisman (board game)#First and second edition|Second Edition]] of the board game. It is a fantasy hybrid [[Board game|board]]/[[role-playing game]], in which players moved across a text-based virtual board, fighting creatures, collecting items, and strengthening their characters through experience. The ultimate goal was to defeat the other players, typically by reaching the ''Crown of Command'' on the game board.

Trevor Mendham reviewed ''Talisman'' for ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' #66, giving it an overall rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that "Overall, the presentation of ''Talisman'' is excellent and the graphics make it a pleasure to play. It will certainly appeal to ''Talisman'' fans lacking opponents, as the computer makes a very reasonable job of this."<ref name="WD66">{{cite magazine |last=Mendham |first=Trevor |date=June 1985 |title=Open Box |journal=[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] |publisher=[[Games Workshop]] |pages=6–7 |issue=66}}</ref> Richard Price of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' gave the game four out of five stars and said: "Even with four players it is unlikely that anyone will be bored as the action can be quite entertaining, even to watch. This gives The Talisman an edge over text-based multiple player games."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Price |first1=Richard |date=May 1985 |title=Sleuthing by the sea - The Talisman |journal=[[Sinclair User]] |publisher=[[EMAP]] |pages=113, 115 |issue=38}}</ref> Paul Coppins of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave it one out of ten and said: "[...] for me this Adventure is summed up in one word — poor!"<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Coppins |first1=Paul |date=July 1985 |title=Reviews - The Talisman |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |page=85}}</ref> Derek Brewster of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' gave the game seven out of ten and said: "Talisman is a very complex strategy game with superb graphics and all the other trappings of a well designed and highly polished piece of software. Where the game really excels is in its offering entertainment for up to four players which is sufficiently complex to keep all interested for the duration. As with all involved strategy games it will take a while to get into it, but I think the time would be well spent as this game has a lot going for it."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Brewster |first1=Derek |date=May 1985 |title=Adventure Trail - Talisman |journal=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |publisher=[[Newsfield Publications Ltd]] |page=116 |issue=16}}</ref>
