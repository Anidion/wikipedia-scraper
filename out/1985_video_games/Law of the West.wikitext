==Gameplay==

The entirety of the game happens in a small frontier town, and the player takes the role of the town's [[Sheriff]]. The scenes are located along the town's main street, with a view from behind the Sheriff's back (the view is so close that only the Sheriff's waist, right arm, and [[firearm|gun]] are visible). Various other characters appear on the main street in front of the Sheriff.

The actual gameplay mostly involves the Sheriff interacting with the various characters via a selection menu similar to those in contemporary graphical adventures. For each line the opposing character says, the game offers a selection of four different responses, and the discussion progresses depending on the chosen response.

Depending on the outcome of a discussion, the Sheriff may get involved in a gunfight. In this case, the gameplay becomes a test of pure shooting skills, as the Sheriff has to shoot his opponent before getting shot himself. Gunplay is accomplished by pushing up on the joystick to draw the weapon, which causes a joystick-controlled crosshairs to appear on the screen. The various characters will react if the Sheriff draws his gun before they have a chance to say their opening line, usually refusing to speak until the gun is put away.

If the Sheriff gets shot, he blacks out, and the doctor is called to help. Depending on the Sheriff's previous interaction with the doctor and the other characters in the game (and if the doctor is in town), he may either be healed, or left for dead (either by the doctor refusing to help or the doctor being drunk at the time). The only goal of the game is for the player to survive until the end of the day; if the player wishes he can gun down every character he meets without talking to them, albeit this will be reflected negatively in the final score.

===Scoring===
The game ends when the Sheriff is shot and the Doctor does not heal him, or when the sun sets after 11 scenarios.<ref name="Law of the West Overview" /> The player is then presented with a final score, which is based on various factors such as how the player dealt with the characters, how many crimes they prevented, and even their success with the ladies.

If the player chose to shoot everybody, they will receive the lowest possible score.<ref name="Law of the West Overview" />
