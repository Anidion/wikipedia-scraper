'''''Magic Mushrooms''''' is a [[platform game]] published in 1985<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=209|website=BBC Micro archives|language=en|title=Magic Mushrooms}}</ref> by [[Acornsoft]] for the [[Acorn Electron]] and [[BBC Micro]] [[home computer]]s.<ref name=chistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/20740/Magic-Mushrooms/|title=Magic Mushrooms|website=computinghistory.com|language=en}}</ref> It includes a built-in level editor.<ref name=onda />

== Gameplay ==
The objective is to guide Murphy, a beer-bellied man with a large nose,<ref name=onda>{{cite web|url=https://peppeguarino.wordpress.com/2020/02/23/magic-mushrooms-bbc-micro-acorn/|title=Magic Mushrooms, un vecchio platform per BBC Micro|website=Legno sopra un'onda|date=23 February 2020 |language=it}}</ref> and remove all the magic mushrooms that populate the levels.<ref name=classic>{{cite web|title=Magic Mushrooms|url=http://classicgaminguk.blogspot.com/2011/10/classic-game-review-magic-mushrooms.html|website=Classic Gaming Blog|date=10 October 2011 |language=en}}</ref>

The screen has a series of green bricks on a black background. To move, the player can use the left, right and jump buttons, as well as climb ladders.<ref name=classic /> Once Murphy has gathered all the mushrooms, the player must use the level's exit platform before time runs out.<ref name=onda />

There are some obstacles in the player's route: wobbly platforms which make Murphy less stable on his feet, conveyor belts which can send the character backwards or slow them, ice platforms which make Murphy slide in one direction until he reaches the end of it, glass which disintegrates under his feet, and finally some enemies that look like mutant [[tomato]]es.<ref name=classic />
