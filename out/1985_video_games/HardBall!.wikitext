'''''HardBall!''''' is a [[baseball]] video game published by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]. Initially released for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1985, it was ported to other computers over the next several years. A [[Sega Genesis]] cartridge was published in 1991. ''HardBall!'' was followed by sequels ''[[HardBall II]]'', ''[[HardBall III]]'', ''[[HardBall IV]]'', ''[[HardBall 5]]'', and ''[[HardBall 6]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:C64 Hardball.png|thumb|left|Throwing a pitch on the Commodore 64 version, with options for the pitcher and batter]]

Play is controlled with a [[joystick]] or [[arrow keys]] and an action button. One of the four cardinal directions is used to choose the pitch, and again to aim it towards low, high, inside (towards batter), or outside (away from batter). The same directions are used to aim the swing when batting. When fielding after a hit, the defensive player closest to the ball will flash to show it is the one currently under control. The four directions are then used to throw to one of the four bases.

Hardball! was one of the first baseball video games to incorporate the perspective from the pitcher's mound, similar to MLB broadcasts.  There are also managerial options available. The player has a selection of pitchers to choose from. Each team member has his own statistics that affect his performance, and can be rearranged as desired. Prior to ''HardBall!''s release, there were managerial baseball games available, such as ''[[MicroLeague Baseball]]'' but ''HardBall!'' was the first to integrate that aspect with the arcade control of the game action itself.

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' picked the game as the #11 greatest game available in 1991, saying: "With its oversaturated colors, ultrarealistic sound effects (when the umpire shouts 'Play ball!' it sounds as if he’s in the room), and detailed managerial options, ''HardBall!'' is the closest you may ever get to playing in a real major-league ballpark."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1991/11/22/video-games-guide/|title=Video Games Guide|website=EW.com}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The game appears in the opening scene of the 1987 film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', being played by [[Fred Savage]].
