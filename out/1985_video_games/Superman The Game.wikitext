'''''Superman: The Game''''' is a 1985 [[video game]] designed by Fernando Herrera and published in the US by [[First Star Software]] for the [[Commodore 64]].<ref>{{lemon64 game|id=2570|name=Superman: The Game}}</ref> For European release, ''Superman'' was ported the [[Acorn Electron]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Superman First Star Game.png|thumb|left|The Kryptonite combat zone (Atari 8-bit)]]

The game is for 2 players (or 1 vs the computer) and pits [[Superman]] against the character [[Darkseid]]. The object of the game is to save citizens of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] (playing as Superman), or lure them to an underground lair (playing as Darkseid).

The game area is split into six sectors; 3 in the streets of Metropolis and 3 underground. Frantic citizens are running around the city and can be directed by deflectors (which can be set in certain directions) or by using super powers (Superman can pick up and carry citizens, Darkseid can teleport them). The players cannot leave a sector until they collect a diamond (or a number of diamonds depending on the difficulty setting). They then get to choose which sector to move to. In between each sector is a 'combat zone' mini-game and comes in a variety of styles. If the player who chose to leave the sector wins, the game moves on to the chosen sector. If they lose, play returns to the previous sector. In the sectors, the players can fire beams of set lengths (Superman uses heat vision, Darkseid fires an omega ray). If they hit, the enemy loses energy and also drops any diamonds collected. These beams are also directed by the deflectors.

The game ends when there are no more citizens running around or one of the players' energy bars is fully drained. The winner is the player who has saved (or lured) the most citizens at this point.

==Release==
Originally released in 1985 for the [[Commodore 64]] in the US by developer [[First Star Software]], it was picked up in the UK by [[Beyond Software]]. Beyond also advertised conversions for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Atari 8-bit computers]], but not all of them{{which?|date=March 2018}} made it to release.<ref name="worldofspectrum">{{cite web|title=Superman: The Game|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005069|website=World of Spectrum|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref> Telecomsoft released the Spectrum version for the first time at a budget price in 1986.<ref name="worldofspectrum" /> In 1987 [[Prism Leisure Corporation]] published the game. This included all of the previous versions as well as new conversions for the [[Commodore 16]]/[[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]], [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]]. The new conversions did not contain the combat zones.

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, ''[[Computer Entertainer]]'' praised the graphics and recommended it for fans of "[[shoot-'em-up]]" arcade styled-games and was refreshing from the amount of adventure and strategy games on the market during the period.<ref>
