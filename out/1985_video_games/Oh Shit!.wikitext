'''''Oh Shit!''''' is a [[List of Pac-Man clones|''Pac-Man'' clone]] released in 1985 for the [[MSX]] by The ByteBusters (Aackosoft's in-house development team) and published by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] publisher [[Aackosoft]] under the ''Classics'' range of games; a range that consists of [[Video game clone|clones]] of arcade games, i.e. ''Scentipede'' being a clone of [[Atari|Atari's]] ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]''. ''Oh Shit!'s'' level and art design is identical to that of ''[[Pac-Man]]''.<ref name=computermagazine /><ref name=computing /><ref name=bankruptcy /><ref name=club />

''Oh Shit!'' was later republished with differing names and cover art several times; ''Oh Shit!'' was renamed to '''''Oh No!''''' for the game's UK release due to the name being considered 'too [[Obscenity|obscene]]',<ref name=computing /> and the name was shortened to '''''Shit!''''' for its release by Premium III Software Distribution.<ref name=howling /> The European re-release ''Shit!'' notably uses cover art from 1985 horror novel ''[[The Howling III: Echoes]]'', possibly without permission.<ref name=howling>{{cite web |title=Shit!

==Releases==
The 1985 MSX release were published by Aackosoft, but later releases of the MSX version were published by different publishers; the European version of ''Oh Shit!'' was later published by Eaglesoft (an alternate label of Aackosoft), and ''Oh Shit!'' was published by Compulogical in [[Spain]].<ref name=spain>{{cite web |title=Oh Shit!

Unlike other Aackosoft titles in the ''Classics'' range, ''Oh Shit!'' is incompatible with MSX 16K computers.<ref name=computermagazine />

Aackosoft went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] in 1988, after which ''Shit!'', alongside other Aackosoft titles, were re-published by Premium III Software Distribution and developed by Eurosoft (a former label of Aackosoft) in the same year.<ref name=bankruptcy /> Premium III Software Distribution released the ''30 MSX Hits'' compilation in 1988, including ''Oh Shit!'' as part of its lineup.<ref name=bankruptcy /> According to Dutch gaming magazine ''MSX-DOS Computer Magazine'', after Aackosoft went bankrupt in 1988, their [[intellectual property]] was transferred to a company called Methodic Solutions, and all previous MSX Aackosoft titles were re-published by Premium III Software Distribution and developed by Eurosoft, both separately and in a compilation titled ''30 MSX Hits''.<ref name=bankruptcy />

''MSX Gids'' criticises ''Oh Shit!'s'' sound effects, stating that "The speech, which gets boring quickly, has been added at the expense of the original wokka-wokka sounds. Too bad."<ref name=gids>{{cite magazine|title = Oh Shit!

Dutch gaming magazine ''MSX Computer Magazine'' reviewed the MSX version of ''Oh Shit!'' alongside other Aackosoft titles based upon arcade titles, ''Boom'' (''[[Galaxian]]''), ''Scentipede'' (''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]''), and ''Hopper'' (''[[Frogger]]'').

''MSX Computer Magazine'', now named ''MSX-DOS Computer Magazine'', reviewed the MSX version of ''Shit!'' alongside other arcade clones, particularly comparing it to another ''Pac-Man'' clone, ''Maze Master'', stating that they prefer the original ''Pac-Man'' or ''Shit!'' over ''Maze Master''. ''MSX-DOS'' expresses that they mourned Aackosoft's [[bankruptcy]], stating that "''Shit!'' used to be a favorite of mine, ''Pac-Man'' fan that I am, and with the loss of Aackosoft a good program was withdrawn from rotation", praising the game's re-publishing by Premium III Software. ''MSX-DOS'' criticises the shortening of the game's speech of "Oh Shit!" to just "Shit!", but still expresses that "Despite that, ''Shit!'' still always remains a sublime ''Pac-Man'', too bad about the change of voice acting."<ref name=bankruptcy>{{cite magazine|title = Go Classic: Shit Review|date = October 1988|url = https://www.msxcomputermagazine.nl/archief/bladen/ms%28x%29dos_computer_magazine_26.pdf|magazine = MSX-DOS Computer Magazine|publisher = MBI Publications|issue = 26|page = 57}}</ref>

''MSX-DOS Computer Magazine'' notes ''30 MSX Hits' '' MSX2 compatibility, further expressing that not all MSX games offer this compatibility, stating "So you thought that any MSX program could be used on any MSX computer? As long as you don't try MSX2 software on MSX1 hardware? Well, everyone thought that, in the past. Before the MSX standard was well defined, game programmers sometimes did not adhere to that standard. There has been a lot of trouble with non-running games in the past."<ref name=msxdoshits>{{cite magazine|title = 30 MSX Hits, Games at Floor Prices|date = June 1988|url = https://www.msxcomputermagazine.nl/archief/bladen/ms%28x%29dos_computer_magazine_23.pdf|magazine = MSX-DOS Computer Magazine|publisher = MBI Publications|issue = 23|pages = 78–79}}</ref> ''Oh Shit!'s'' MSX2 compatibility was also noted by ''MSX Club Magazine'' in their review of ''30 MSX Hits'' in 1988.<ref name=clubhits>{{cite magazine|title = 30 MSX Hits|date = September 1988|url = https://www.msxclubmagazine.be/docs/msxclubmag20.pdf|magazine = MSX Club Magazine|publisher = DAInamic VZW|issue = 20|page = 24 }}</ref>
