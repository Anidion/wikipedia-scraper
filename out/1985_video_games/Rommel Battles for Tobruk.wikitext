==Reception==
M. Evan Brooks reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Overall, ''Rommel'' is an extremely detailed simulation. But the detail clutters playability to an unconscionable degree so that ''Rommel'' becomes an exercise in frustration."<ref name="CGW32">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M. Evan |title=Rommel: Battles for Tobruk |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=November 1986 |volume=1 |issue=32 |pages=46â€“48}}</ref>
