'''''Ghosts 'n Goblins''''', known as {{Nihongo|'''''Makaimura'''''|魔界村||lit. "Demon World Village"|lead=yes}} in Japan, is a [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed by [[Capcom]] and released for [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1985. It is the first game in the ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' franchise, and has since been [[ported]] to numerous home platforms.

It was a major commercial success across arcades and home systems. It was among the top ten highest-grossing [[1986 in video games|arcade games of 1986]] in Japan and the US, the year's sixth best-selling computer game in the UK, and [[NES]] version sold over {{nowrap|1.6 million}} cartridges worldwide. It initially received generally positive reviews from critics. It is often cited as one of the most difficult games of all time, and retrospectively it has been considered [[List of video games considered the best|one of the greatest video games ever made]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Ghosts 'n Goblins arcade screenshot.png|thumb|left|The gameplay showing Arthur in his unarmored, boxer shorts-wearing state, which results from the first of only two hits he can take]]
The player controls a [[knight]] named [[Arthur (Ghosts 'n Goblins)|Sir Arthur]], who must defeat [[zombie]]s, [[giant]]s (referred to as "big men"), [[demon]]s, [[cyclopes]], [[dragons]], and other [[monster]]s to rescue Princess Prin-Prin, who has been kidnapped by [[Astaroth]] (also called the Devil or Great Satan, to distinguish him from another boss demon named [[Satan]]), king of Demon World. Along the way, the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses, and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7938 |title=Ghosts 'n Goblins |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |access-date=5 Oct 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327195528/http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7938 |archive-date=27 March 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The player can only be hit twice before losing a life, which results in having to restart the level, or starting at the checkpoint if the player has reached it. Furthermore, the player will lose a life if a level is not completed within a set time limit. After defeating the final boss (The Devil), the player must then replay the entire game on a higher difficulty level to reach the genuine final ending.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=Cinemassacre|title=Ghosts N' Goblins - Angry Video Game Nerd - Episode 108|date=2012-10-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94Y6y1MOoEo|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>

==Ports==
''Ghosts 'n Goblins'' was ported to [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore 16]], [[Game Boy Color]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[NEC PC-8801]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

=== Consoles===
The Famicom version was released on June 13, 1986, and was the first Famicom game to utilize a 128 KB cartridge.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9PuSrn_H1c |title= Famicom Disk System (Documentary) |date= 14 July 2016 |publisher= The Gaming Historian (YouTube) |access-date= 2016-07-14 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161117143011/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9PuSrn_H1c |archive-date= 2016-11-17 |url-status= live }}</ref> The North American NES version was released on November 1, 1986, and in Europe in 1989. The Famicom/NES version was programmed by [[Micronics]] and published by [[Capcom]]. A hidden in-game credits screen verifies that it was scored by the original composer, [[Ayako Mori]]. Upon defeating the game a second time, the player is given the following message:

{{blockquote|Congraturation! This story is happy end. Thank you. Being the wise and courageour knight that you are you feel strongth welling. In your body. Return to starting point. Challenge Again!<ref name=":0" />}}

The Famicom/NES ports served as the basis for the Game Boy Color version, which utilized [[password]]s to allow the player to access certain levels. [[Allister Brimble]] scored this version.

===Computers===
[[File:GhostsNGoblins Screenshot.png|thumb|left|A screenshot from the Commodore 64 version]]
The [[Commodore 64]] version, released in 1986, contains music by [[Mark Cooksey]], which borrows from [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s [[Prelude, Op. 28, No. 20 (Chopin)|Prelude Op. 28, No. 20]]. Due to the limited resources on the Commodore 64, it was somewhat different from the arcade version as it only features certain levels. In 2015, Ghosts'n Goblins Arcade, a fan-made version more closely matching the original arcade game, was ported to C64.

The version for [[Commodore 16]]/116 and [[Commodore Plus/4]], also released in 1986 by Elite Systems, was even more limited than the C64 version. It was written to work on a Commodore 16, which had only 16 KB of RAM. Therefore, this version features only two levels and no music. In addition, the remaining two levels and the gameplay are simplified.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A version for the [[Amiga]] was released in 1990. While the hardware of the Amiga allowed an almost perfect conversion of the arcade game, it failed to emulate the success of the Commodore 64 version. The player starts the game with six lives, and no music plays unless the Amiga was equipped with at least 1 [[megabyte]] of [[RAM]]. The standard configuration of an [[Amiga 500]] had 512 [[kilobyte]]s.

[[Mark Cooksey]] scored the C64, Amiga and ST versions. [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]] scored the Amstrad CPC version.

The game is often cited as an example of one of the most difficult games of all time, due to its extremely hard level design and the fact that the player dies within two hits while the enemies can spawn unexpectedly all over the map. Moreover, the player must play through all of the levels again at a higher difficulty setting unlocked after completing the levels regularly in order to beat the game, without any way to save. ''Gamerant'' named it the 5th hardest video game of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-04-09|title=The 20 Hardest Video Games of All Time|url=https://gamerant.com/top-hard-video-game-945/|access-date=2020-06-28|website=Game Rant|language=en-US}}</ref> In a 2011 review, Lucas Thomas of ''[[IGN]]'' opined that the game was so hard it would be a "waste of time" for most players, as they would not be able to justify the eight-dollar price tag the game had at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/01/15/ghosts-n-goblins-review|title=Ghosts 'N Goblins Review|website=IGN|last1=Thomas|first1=Lucas M.|date=May 9, 2012|accessdate=March 16, 2022}}</ref>
