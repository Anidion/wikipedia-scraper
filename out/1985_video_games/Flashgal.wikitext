According to ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', the game is a [[superhero]] beat 'em up that "takes a lot of its inspiration from" ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' (1984).<ref name="RG">{{cite news |title=The Unconverted |url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/retro-gamer/20200123/281676846862054 |access-date=29 July 2021 |work=[[Retro Gamer]] |via=[[PressReader]] |date=23 January 2020}}</ref> It is a single-plane brawler that distinguishes its gameplay with the use of auto-[[scrolling]]. It also has a female protagonist, who bears a resemblance to superheroines such as [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Elektra (character)|Elektra]].<ref name="RG"/><ref name="HG101"/> She also resembles [[Blaze Fielding]] from Sega's ''[[Streets of Rage]]'' series. Coincidentally, this game also features a crime boss with firearms, jetpackers, ninjas, and a motorcycle level that was cut from the third game due to time constraints.
