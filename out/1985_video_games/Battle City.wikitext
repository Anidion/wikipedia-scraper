{{nihongo foot|'''''Battle City'''''|バトルシティー|Batoru Shitī|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[Shoot 'em up#Multidirectional shooter|multi-directional shooter]] [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] produced and published in 1985 by [[Namco]]. It is a successor to Namco's 1980 ''[[Tank Battalion]]'', and would be succeeded itself by the 1991 ''[[Tank Force]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=Tank-force&page=detail&id=2832 |title=Tank Force, Arcade Video game by NAMCO, Ltd.

An [[Arcade game|arcade]] version for the [[Nintendo VS. System]] would follow, along with a [[Game Boy]] version in 1991, which was developed and published by Nova Games. The Famicom version was later included as an unlockable in the Japanese release of ''[[Star Fox Assault]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |author1=GameSpot Staff |title=New details, dates emerge on upcoming Nintendo titles for Japan |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-dates-emerge-on-upcoming-nintendo-titles-for-japan/1100-6116470/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=January 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812121449/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-dates-emerge-on-upcoming-nintendo-titles-for-japan/1100-6116470/ |archive-date=12 August 2020 |date=15 January 2005}}</ref> and would eventually be digitally re-released via the [[Virtual Console]] for [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]].

Although the Famicom version was never officially released outside Japan, a hack of ''Battle City'' named "Tank 1990"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/games/tank-1990 |title=Tank 1990 |website=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=20 April 2024}}</ref> was one of the most common inclusions in unofficial [[famiclone]] [[multicart]]s.<ref name="hg-101">{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tank-battalion-battle-city/ |title=Tank Battalion / Battle City |last=Murphy |first=Ed |magazine=[[Hardcore Gaming 101]] |date=2 September 2021 |access-date=12 April 2023}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The player controls a [[tank]] and shoot projectiles to destroy enemy tanks around the playfield. The enemy tanks enter from the top of the screen and attempt to destroy the player's base (represented on the screen as a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] symbol), as well as the player's tank itself. A level is completed when the player destroys 20 enemy tanks, but the game ends if the player's base is destroyed or the player loses all available lives. Note that the player can destroy the base as well, so the player can still lose even after all enemy tanks are destroyed.

''Battle City'' contains 35 different stages that are 13 units wide by 13 units high. Each map contains different types of terrain and obstacles. Examples include [[brick]] walls that can be destroyed by having either the player's tank or an enemy tank shoot at them, [[steel]] walls that can be destroyed by the player if they have collected three stars, bushes that hide tanks under them, ice fields that make it difficult to control the tank and patches of water which cannot be crossed by tanks. The game becomes more challenging in later levels, as enemy tanks may act as decoys to lure players away from their base so that another tank can destroy it. In addition, flashing red tanks releases a random power-up when destroyed. There are several types of power-ups, such as a clock that stops all enemies, a protective shield, and a bomb that eliminates all on-screen enemies. The enemy tanks come in four different sizes, with the largest one requiring four shots to destroy.

==Features==
The original Famicom version of ''Battle City'' provides a [[co-op multiplayer]] mode and a built-in [[level editor]], one of the earliest video games to do so.<ref name="hg-101"/> Due to its simplicity, ''Battle City'' hosts an extensive [[ROM hacking]] scene.<ref name="hg-101"/>
