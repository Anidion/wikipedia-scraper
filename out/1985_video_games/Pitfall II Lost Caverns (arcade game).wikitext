'''''Pitfall II: The Lost Caverns''''' is a 1985 arcade game developed by [[Sega]]. It is based upon [[Activision]]'s two home console games ''[[Pitfall!]]'' (1982) and ''[[Pitfall II: Lost Caverns]]'' (1984) for the [[Atari 2600]]. It has been described by historian Brett Weiss as a "rare occurrence" of an Arcade game being influenced by a console game.{{sfn|Weiss|2014|p=171}}

==Gameplay==
''Pitfall II: The Lost Caverns'' focuses on Pitfall Harry locating three treasures hidden in large caverns. The player must maneuver the character within a time limit to earn extra points and additional playtime. When Pitfall Harry interacts with a key, a hope opens which allows the player to continue into a new cavern allowing for bonus points and more time allotted on the timer.<ref name="arcade-flyer">{{cite book |title=Pitfall II - The Lost Caverns |format=arcade flyer |year=1984 |publisher=[[Sega]]|url=https://archive.org/details/arcadeflyer_pitfall-ii-the-lost-caverns/page/n1/mode/2up|via=[[Archive.org]]|accessdate=June 12, 2023}}</ref>

==Production and release==

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' declared the game to be "as good as, if not better than" the original Atari 2600 games.<ref name="cvg046">{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games (magazine)|Computer & Video Games]] |issue=46|date=August 1985 |page=108 |issn=0261-3697 |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-046/page/n107|accessdate=June 12, 2023|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>

From retrospective reviews, Earl Green of [[AllGame]] stated that the game boasted more detailed and colorful graphics than either of the Atari 2600 ''Pitfall'' games, with enough twists to challenge console veterans.{{sfn|Green}}
