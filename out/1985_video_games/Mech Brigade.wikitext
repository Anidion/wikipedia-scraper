Author Rusel DeMaria later reported that ''Mech Brigade'' was "superior in design but inferior in sales" to ''Kampfgruppe''.<ref name=highscore /> 

Jay Selover reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The addition of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM's), combat helicopters, and all the other trappings of modern combat make ''Mech Brigade'' a much more dangerous place to take a Sunday stroll."<ref name="CGW29">{{cite magazine |last=Selover |first=Jay |title=Battlegroup & Mech Brigade |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=June–July 1986 |volume=1 |issue=29 |pages=10–11, 43}}</ref> In ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'', Dr. John Stanoch opined that ''Mech Brigade'' is "certainly not a game for beginners".<ref name=antic>{{cite journal | author1=Moore, Rich | author2=Stanoch, John | title=Call to Wargames | journal=[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]] | date=March 1988 | volume=6 | number=11 | pages=10, 14 }}</ref>

In his 1989 computer wargame survey, J. L. Miller of ''Computer Play'' offered ''Mech Brigade'' a generally positive score but found that the "weapons systems seem to lack the lethality that they in fact possess".<ref name=computerplay />

As it had with ''Kampfgruppe'', ''Computer Gaming World'' inducted ''Mech Brigade'' into its Hall of Fame.<ref name=hof>{{cite magazine | author=Staff | title=The ''CGW'' Hall of Fame | issue=45 | date=March 1988 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | page=44 }}</ref> The magazine's Alan Emrich later said that ''Mech Brigade'' was "the pre-eminent tank game until the arrival of ''[[M-1 Tank Platoon]]''."<ref name=guru />
