{{nihongo foot|'''''Star Luster'''''|スターラスター|Sutā Rasutā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1985 [[space combat simulator]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Namco]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in Japan.<ref name="1UP">{{cite web |last1=Barnholt |first1=Ray |title=25 Sorta Significant Famicom Games: #24 - Star Luster: To Boldly Go |url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?publicUserId=4547783&bId=8832907 |website=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[IGN]] |access-date=January 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018195937/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?publicUserId=4547783&bId=8832907 |archive-date=October 18, 2012 |date=August 16, 2008}}</ref> and adapted for play in arcades via the [[Nintendo VS.

An enhanced version of ''Star Luster'' was published for the [[X68000]] in August 1994.<ref name="4Gamer">{{cite web |title=レトロンバーガーOrder 41：「ナムコットコレクション」がFCタイトルだけだったので，FC以外から俺セレクションをクーソーする編 |trans-title=Retron Burger Order 41: "Namcot Collection" was only an FC title, so I'm fantasizing about my selection from other than FC |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/501/G050159/20200625171/ |website=[[4Gamer.net]] |publisher=Aetas |access-date=November 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031225449/https://www.4gamer.net/games/501/G050159/20200625171/ |archive-date=October 31, 2020 |language=ja |date=July 4, 2020}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Star Ixiom]]'', was released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999.

''Star Luster'' was initially met with mixed reviews and poor sales. The game's reliance on obtuse level objectives and random enemy encounters have been blamed for its lack of popularity, in addition to the Famicom's userbase being primarily children that didn't understand its design. Retrospectively, ''Star Luster'' has received more positive reviews for its 3D perspective and presentation.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Star Luster game screenshot.png|thumb|left|Looking out from the ship's cockpit at an enemy.]]
''Star Luster'' involves moving through open space via a first-person cockpit view and engaging enemy ships. The player's ship has limited fuel and can be refueled at bases. A map and [[Automap|radar]] show locations of enemies and bases. The player can choose a location on the map and warp to it, with the current date changing based on the warp distance.<ref name="1UP"/> The game uses a [[Health (gaming)#Regenerating health|regenerating shield]] and may be the first game with such a mechanic.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sullivan |first1=Lucas |title=Top 7 Games you didn't know did it first |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/top-7-games-you-didnt-know-did-it-first/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |access-date=January 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812182846/http://www.gamesradar.com/top-7-games-you-didnt-know-did-it-first/ |archive-date=August 12, 2020 |date=March 10, 2014}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1998, the game was included on a compilation made for the [[PlayStation]] known as ''[[Namco Anthology|Namco Anthology 1]]'' where, like all of the Famicom games presented on the disc, an enhanced arrange mode was provided alongside the unaltered original game. The Famicom version was later included in the Japanese version of Nintendo and Namco's ''[[Star Fox Assault]]'',<ref>{{cite web |author1=GameSpot Staff |title=New details, dates emerge on upcoming Nintendo titles for Japan |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-dates-emerge-on-upcoming-nintendo-titles-for-japan/1100-6116470/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=January 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812121449/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-dates-emerge-on-upcoming-nintendo-titles-for-japan/1100-6116470/ |archive-date=August 12, 2020 |date=January 15, 2005}}</ref> and was released for the [[Wii Virtual Console]] in Japan on March 4, 2008.<ref name="Famitsu">{{cite magazine |title=スターラスター (FC) |url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=9043&redirect=no |magazine=[[Famitsu]] |publisher=[[Kadokawa Corporation]] |access-date=January 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829012004/https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=9043&redirect=no |archive-date=August 29, 2019 |language=ja}}</ref>

A sequel, ''[[Star Ixiom]]'', was released for the PlayStation in 1999 for Japan and Europe. The game is very similar to that of its predecessor and adds seven selectable ships: the ''Gaia Σ'', Spartacus, Tycoon, Ogre-Header, Dragoon J2 (connected to Dragoon, from ''[[Galaxian 3]]''), the GeoSword from ''[[Starblade]]'', and the Galaxip from ''[[Galaxian]]''.

The game was a significant inspiration for director [[Katsuya Eguchi]] when he was working on ''[[Star Fox 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Reeves |first1=Ben |title=The Inside Story On The Star Fox Sequel That Took 22 Years To Release |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/index.php/b/features/archive/2017/09/30/the-inside-story-on-the-star-fox-sequel-that-took-more-than-20-years-to-release.aspx |magazine=Game Informer |language=en}}</ref> ''[[Castlevania]]'' series producer [[Koji Igarashi]] has listed ''Star Luster'' as his second-favorite NES game.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffman |first1=Chris |title=Nintendo Entertainment System 20th Anniversary |url=https://archive.org/details/Play_046_Oct_2005/page/n85 |accessdate=16 January 2020 |agency=Play |issue=46 |date=October 2005 |pages=84–87}}</ref>
