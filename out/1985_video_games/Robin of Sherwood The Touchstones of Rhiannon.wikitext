'''''Robin of Sherwood: The Touchstones of Rhiannon''''' is a 1985 video game by [[Adventure International]], created as a TV tie-in to the television series ''[[Robin of Sherwood]]''. It was released on the [[ZX Spectrum]] computer.

The game's graphics and animations were given consistent high praise, while its difficulty (due to extra-specificity required for the commands) was criticised.

== Plot ==
The game opens with Robin Hood and his friends Will Scarlet and Much the miller's son locked inside Nottingham castle. Meanwhile, The Prophecies of Gildas have prophecised that a Hooded Man will come to Sherwood forest and do the bidding of [[Herne the Hunter]], Lord of the Trees. Robin Hood must escape Nottingham Castle, meet with Herne, and retrieve the "Touchstones of Rhiannon", six magical [[talisman]]s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/21/rhiannon.htm|title=The Touchstones of Rhiannon|date=October 21, 1985|website=Crash Magazine (Issue 21)|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref><ref name=":2" />

== Gameplay ==
The game's interface sees a main image in the centre of the screen, a short description of the location, and a scrolling input located at the bottom. While the game has superlative graphics for the time, this resulted in a limited range of vocabulary that the game could accept.<ref name=":0" /> The mix of location graphics and text was a first for Adventure International.<ref name=":2" />
