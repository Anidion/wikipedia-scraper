'''''Road Runner''''' is a racing video game based on the [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner shorts]]. It was released in arcades by [[Atari Games]] in 1985.

==Gameplay==

The player controls Road Runner, who is chased by Wile E. Coyote. In order to escape, Road Runner runs endlessly to the left. While avoiding Wile E. Coyote, the player must pick up bird seeds on the street, avoid obstacles like cars, and get through mazes. Most of the time Wile E. Coyote will just run after the Road Runner, but he occasionally uses tools like rockets, roller skates, and [[pogo stick]]s.

==Development==
Originally, the game was going to use [[LaserDisc]] technology for the backgrounds and road. When the player died in the game, one of many cartoon death sequences taken from the original shorts would have shown.

The game was going to be released in 1984, but Atari decided to cancel the game. The game was eventually released in 1985, but this version was a modified version. The LaserDisc cutscenes were taken out of the final game, and the road and backgrounds were changed to computer-generated graphics. The prototype cabinet was eventually found, and it is now playable at California Extreme.

==Music==
The background music during attract mode and 4th level is "[[Sabre Dance]]" from ''[[Gayane (ballet)|Gayane]]'' by [[Aram Khachaturian]], the 1st level music is "[[William Tell Overture]]" by [[Gioachino Rossini]], 2nd level music is "[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and 3rd level is "[[Trepak (The Nutcracker)|Trepak]]" from ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].
