'''''Don't Buy This''''' (also known as '''''Don't Buy This: Five of the Worst Games Ever''''') is a [[Product bundling|compilation]] of [[video game]]s for the [[ZX Spectrum]] released on 1 April 1985. As described on the box, it contains five of the poorest games submitted to publisher [[Telecomsoft#Firebird|Firebird]]. Instead of rejecting the submissions, they decided to mock the original developers by releasing them together and publicly brand it as "unoriginal" and "awful". Firebird even disowned all their copyright to the game and encouraged buyers to pirate it at will.<ref name="instructions" />

Reviews for the game were universally negative, with critics questioning how to critique the game due to its publicity being based on it being a collection of bad games. Despite the negative reception, the game was a commercial success.

[[File:Collage of Don't Buy This.png|thumb|left|Clockwise: ''Fido 1'', ''Weasel Willy'', ''Race Ace'', and ''Fruit Machine''.]]
*'''''Fido 1''''': The player controls a dog named Fido to defeat moles and birds<ref name="instructions">[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/d/DontBuyThis.txt  Don't Buy This instructions] at [http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ World of Spectrum]</ref> to protect an area for several levels. Fido also needs to keep eating in order to stay alive. In the later levels, enemies such as a low flying canary and a cat which throws projectiles at you are added, but their attacks are very easy to avoid.
*'''''Fido 2: Puppy Power''''': Features similar gameplay as the original ''Fido'', but Fido can now move up and down instead of just left and right. In addition to Fido being able to defeat enemies with its tail, used as an attack in the previous game, Fido can now shoot laser beams from its eyes in order to destroy other enemies and gain health.
*'''''Fruit Machine''''': The player controls an animated, low-resolution slot machine with reels that spin rather slowly. The instructions sarcastically describe the game as a "mysterious, original new game [that] requires skill, timing, nerve and absolute concentration".<ref name="instructions" /> It also suggests that you should play the game in the middle of the night while also sleeping. A medley of short tunes plays when the player wins. 
*'''''Race Ace''''': A racing game where the player controls a light blue race car that can only turn 90 and 180-degree angles. The game is impossible to win, regardless of the speed setting of the player's car because the computer-controlled cars advance more quickly every time the player turns. The controls have the tendency to freeze if another car invades your space. On one screen, the game is erroneously titled "''Ace Racer''". There is evidence to suggest that ''Race Ace'' was first published as its own cassette in 1983, having been developed by Tony Rainbird, who co-created the Firebird label, as opposed to being a submitted indie game.<ref>https://www.badgamehalloffame.com/dont-buy-this/</ref>
*'''''Weasel Willy''''': A game where a purported weasel, which in actuality has the appearance of a humanoid figure in-game, has to avoid trees that are completely green and its own large, uniform footprints. The trees spawn in random locations whenever a level starts, so the weasel may be blocked by trees, preventing the player from being able to play the level. The weasel may even start a level with a tree occupying the same space as it does, causing immediate loss of the level.<ref name="CRASH"/>

''[[Your Spectrum]]'' wrote: "The games aren't that bad as do-it-yourself games but, they won't provide that much fun."<ref name="YS"/> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' said it contained "five of the most uninspired games ever to disgrace the Spectrum."<ref name="SUser"/>

A reviewer for ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' noted that the game was difficult to give a score due to it being publicised as being a collection of bad games, but declared it to be "good for a laugh".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|title=Don't Buy This|page=[https://archive.org/details/ComputerAndVideoGamesIssue045Jul85/page/n93 94]|issue=45|date=July 1985|url=https://archive.org/details/ComputerAndVideoGamesIssue045Jul85}}</ref> 

John Szczepaniak from ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' featured the game as part of their "Your Weekly [[Kusoge]]" column. Szczepaniak, while describing the games as "uninspired, dull and lazy", he did not consider them to be the worst games on the ZX Spectrum.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web|url=https://hg101.kontek.net/kusoge/kusoge-dontbuythis.htm|title=Your Weekly Kusoge: Don't Buy This|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=12 May 2011|access-date=5 November 2018}}</ref> Despite the negative criticism towards the game, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' in 2005 reported that it was a commercial success.<ref name="Retro"/>
