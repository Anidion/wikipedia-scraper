'''''Blade Runner''''' is a 1985 [[Shoot 'em up|shoot 'em up game]] loosely inspired by the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]''. The game was published in 1985 by CRL Group PLC for [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[Amstrad CPC]]. Reviews of the game were mostly negative.

==Plot==
The plot of the game is similar to the associated movie. Replidroids (''sic'' for [[replicant]]s), designed for use in space, have been banned from Earth following a revolt on a colony. The role of eliminating any replidroids found on earth is given to a unit of bounty hunters.<ref name="sinclairuser" />

==Gameplay==

The game features the player character hunting down replicants for bounty money.<ref name="crashmarch" /> On loading the game, the player has to listen to around two minutes of music from the movie soundtrack without any ability to skip the sequence.<ref name="sinclairuser">{{cite journal | title = Blade Runner | journal = [[Sinclair User]]| issue = 48 | page = 54| publisher = [[EMAP]]| date = March 1986 | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue048/Pages/SinclairUser04800054.jpg | access-date =11 February 2012}}</ref> Author Will Brooker notes that due to the computers' sonic limitations, the "grandiose swoops and fanfares" of the soundtrack were reduced to "a tinny one-channel burble".<ref>{{cite book|title=Alien Zone II: the spaces of science-fiction cinema|chapter=Internet fandom and the continuing narratives of ''Star Wars'', ''Blade Runner'' and ''Alien'' |last=Brooker|first=Will|editor=Kuhn, Annette|page=58|publisher=Verso|year=1999 |isbn=978-1-85984-259-1}}</ref>

The game first presents the player with a map showing the locations of the fugitive replicants and the player's flying car, which must be steered over a droid on the map. At this point the game switches to a side scrolling game in which the player must avoid crowds and cars whilst in pursuit of the replicant.<ref name="sinclairuser2">{{cite journal | title = Blade Runner| journal = [[Sinclair User]]| issue = 48 | page = 55| publisher = [[EMAP]]| date = March 1986 | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue048/Pages/SinclairUser04800055.jpg | access-date =11 February 2012}}</ref> As the levels increase, so does the level of the replicants.

==Development and release==
The game is "inspired by the [[Vangelis]] [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]" of the 1982 ''[[Blade Runner]]'' movie. The publisher was unable to obtain rights to the actual movie, so the game was instead said to be based on the soundtrack.<ref name="crashmarch">{{cite journal | title = On the tail of replidroids in CRL's Blade Runner| journal = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| issue = 26 | page = 14| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications Ltd]]| date = March 1986 | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue26/Pages/Crash2600014.jpg | access-date =11 February 2012}}</ref> The inlay stated that it was a "video game interpretation of the film score".<ref name="yoursincl">{{cite journal | title = Screen Shots: Blade Runner| journal = [[Your Sinclair]]| issue = 3 | page = 28| publisher = [[Dennis Publishing]]| date = May 1986 | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue03/Pages/YourSinclair0300028.jpg | access-date =11 February 2012}}</ref>

''[[Sinclair User]]'' called the game pretentious<ref name="sinclairuser" /> and the graphics plodding. The reviewer disliked the lengthy repeating cut scenes, saying that they "are well put together, but after you've seen them more than once you'll get an irresistible urge to smash up your Spectrum".<ref name="sinclairuser2" /> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' thought that the game was lacking in variety and did not feel like a finished product.<ref name="yoursincl" /> ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' criticized the lack of graphical variety and thought that all the characters looked the same. The reviewer also criticised the sluggishness of the game's controls and that it was too much like a cut-down version of the hit 1984 game ''[[Ghostbusters (Activision video game)|Ghostbusters]]''.<ref name="crashreview">{{cite journal | title = Reviews – Blade Runner| journal = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| issue = 27 | page = 128| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications Ltd]]| date = April 1986 | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue27/Pages/Crash2700128.jpg | access-date =11 February 2012}}</ref> Reviewing the game on the [[Commodore 64]], ''[[Zzap!64]]'' panned the high difficulty level of the game and described the graphics as bland.<ref name="zzap" /> Commodore User also thought the graphics were poor and the game disappointing, although they did praise the "excellent" music. They thought it would have been ok as a budget title, but was not worth the full price.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/commodore-user-magazine-29/Commodore_User_Issue_29_1986_Feb#page/n37/mode/2up|title = Commodore User Magazine Issue 29|date = February 1986}}</ref>

Barry Atkins of the [[University of Wales]]'s School of Film, Photography and Digital Media describes the game as lazily executed and unsatisfying, "yok[ing] unoriginal gameplay mechanics to glancing visual references to the originating film". In his view, the game was merely an effort to cash in on the film's intellectual property, reducing "all the subtleties, complexities and ambiguities of the film ... to a game that players in the 1980s would have immediately recognised as a fairly mundane example of the '[[shoot 'em up]]' genre, where slogans such as 'Move Off World' painted across a primary coloured and flat game space gesture only vaguely to the film as the player adopts the role of a bounty hunter in a raincoat who bears a crude likeness to [[Rick Deckard|Deckard]]".<ref>{{cite book |last=Atkins|first=Barry|title=The Blade Runner Experience: the legacy of a science fiction classic|chapter=Replicating the Blade Runner|editor=Brooker, Will|pages=81–82 |publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-904764-30-4}}</ref>
