{{nihongo foot|'''''Hang-On'''''|ハングオン|Hangu On|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[arcade racing game]] released by [[Sega]] in 1985 and later ported to the [[Master System]]. In the game, the player controls a motorcycle against time and other computer-controlled bikes. It was one of the first [[arcade games]] to use [[16-bit computing|16-bit]] graphics and uses the [[Sega Super Scaler|Super Scaler]] [[arcade system board]], created with design input from [[Yu Suzuki]], as technology to [[2.5D|simulate 3D effects]]. The deluxe cabinet version also introduced a motion-controlled [[arcade cabinet]], where the player's body movement on a large motorbike-shaped cabinet corresponds with the player character's movements on screen.

Yu Suzuki began development of ''Hang-On'' after deciding to design a motorcycle racing game as a way to use a [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bar]] in an arcade game. With market research suggesting [[MotoGP|GP 500]] racing was popular, Suzuki took inspiration from world champion [[Freddie Spencer]] and his style of racing. The game's soundtrack was written by [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (composer)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]], who used rock music that was uncommon in arcade games at the time.

''Hang-On'' was very popular at launch and sold well for Sega, becoming the highest-grossing arcade [[1985 in video games|video game of 1985]] in the United States and then the highest-grossing [[1986 in video games|arcade game of 1986]] in both Japan and the United States. It received a positive critical reception for its realism, graphics, bike cabinet and physical controls, though there was some initial controversy in Japan over modesty concerns involving female players with the bike cabinet. The game started the trend of "taiken" [[motion simulator]] games in the late 1980s, which Sega followed with hits such as ''[[Space Harrier]]'' (1985), ''[[Out Run]]'' (1986), and ''[[After Burner]]'' (1987); this helped the [[arcade video game]] market recover during the late 1980s. ''Hang-On'' has been recognized as a well-remembered and influential arcade game. Several sequels were later made for arcades, as well as video game consoles.

Suzuki was given the freedom to decide what kind of game to design, and as a fan of cars and motorcycles, he chose to design a game where the arcade cabinet simulated an actual motorcycle and players would have to move side to side on the motorcycle to turn.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2018|isbn=9781476631967|pages=92–97}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite magazine|date=January 2016|title=The Arcade Pioneer: The Story of Yu Suzuki|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=150|pages=96–99}}</ref> He also had a desire to make his game better than ''[[Pole Position]]'', a [[Namco]] game which had beaten out Sega's [[Turbo (video game)|''Turbo'']] in popularity.<ref name=":6">{{Cite magazine|last=Davies|first=Jonti|date=September 2008|title=The Making Of: OutRun|magazine=Retro Gamer|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=54|pages=26–33|issn=1742-3155}}</ref> In developing the game, Suzuki wanted to make his new motorcycle racing game a realistic experience.

In designing the game, Suzuki had to decide on a style of motorcycle racing for the game. Suzuki himself was a fan of dirt bikes, along with [[motocross]] and [[Enduro]],<ref name=":0" /> and dirt bikes would later be used in Suzuki's ''[[Enduro Racer]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/enduroracer/enduroracer.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Enduro Racer|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617035449/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/enduroracer/enduroracer.htm|archive-date=17 June 2015|access-date=3 June 2015}}</ref> However, Sega's market research concluded that road-based [[MotoGP|GP 500 racing]] was more popular worldwide. While Suzuki was doing research for the game, he admired the riding style of [[Freddie Spencer]], who had just become the youngest person to win a motorcycling world championship at 21 years old. According to Suzuki, "Freddie Spencer's riding style, it was ''so'' nice. And my game was like a homage. That's the reason I wanted to make it – Freddie Spencer, he rode a [[Honda]] bike, and I loved the way he hung on!"<ref name="Robinson" /> Two [[Arcade cabinet|cabinet]] designs were made: a basic version with a handlebar and levers, and the deluxe cabinet which featured the full motorcycle to be tilted. Suzuki had additional features he wanted to implement that could not be done due to cost, including a [[gyroscope]] to simulate motorcycle acceleration and deceleration.<ref name="Robinson"/><ref name="Historia">{{cite book |chapter=Yu Suzuki Interview |title=セガハードヒストリア |trans-title=Sega Hard Historia |date=March 2021 |publisher=[[SB Creative]] |isbn=978-4-7973-9943-1 |language=ja}} ([https://www.phantomriverstone.com/2021/08/mar-2021-yu-suzuki-interview-sega-hard.html Part 1] and [https://www.phantomriverstone.com/2021/08/march-2021-yu-suzuki-interview-part-two.html Part 2])</ref> The title is derived from when the biker is turning and has to "hang on" to the bike while the bike is leaning, which Suzuki had read in a Japanese bike magazine.  Suzuki later learned the technique was called "hang off" in North America, but he chose to keep the former name.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 10|episode-link=GameCenter CX#1st Season|series=[[GameCenter CX]]|network=[[Fuji TV]]|airdate=2003}}</ref>

''Hang-On'' is considered well-regarded for its music, which was composed by [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (composer)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]].<ref name=":0" /> He came to Suzuki's attention after Suzuki heard he played in a band. Suzuki wanted songs for the soundtrack to ''Hang-On'' that would be like what a band would play. This led to Kawaguchi writing four songs for the game, including "Theme of Love", the game's theme song. Kawaguchi made use of the hardware's [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] sampling and added drum samples to use ''Hang-On''<nowiki/>'s [[Yamaha YM2203]] sound chip to its maximum potential and create a more realistic soundtrack featuring rock music, which was uncommon in arcade games at the time. He also created the game's sound effects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sega-16.com/2016/02/sega-stars-hiroshi-kawaguchi/|title=Sega Stars: Hiroshi Kawaguchi|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|date=15 February 2016|website=Sega-16|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801070019/http://www.sega-16.com/2016/02/sega-stars-hiroshi-kawaguchi/|archive-date=1 August 2019|access-date=6 February 2020}}</ref> Kawaguchi did not program his own music into the game; he instead wrote out his soundtrack by hand, made a demo, and gave that to the sound programmer.

== Release ==
[[File:Sega Hang on Arcade Automat.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Upright version of the arcade cabinet.|alt=An arcade cabinet with handlebars]]
Sega debuted ''Hang-On'' at the [[Hotel New Otani Tokyo]] on 2 July 1985. It drew attention for its innovative ride-on cabinet that realistically simulates a motorcycle and requires the player to use the body, which was a departure from conventional controls that only required using the fingers, as well as its real-time graphics which displayed greater speed and detail than other video games. ''Hang-On'' had a mass-market release in Japan several days later on 5 July.<ref name="GM265">{{cite magazine|title=Overseas Readers Column: Sega Unveiled "Hang-On" Video Player Can Rides On And Slant It|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=265|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 August 1985|page=26|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19850801p.pdf#page=14}}</ref> At its debut in Japan, ''Hang-On''<nowiki/>'s deluxe cabinet was criticized as being inappropriate for [[Japanese culture]]. Suzuki recalled in an interview about criticisms of how the shyness of the Japanese people would mean no one would want to straddle a motorcycle in front of others, or how the motorcycle would be especially unsuitable for female players wearing [[miniskirts]]. These criticisms would eventually subside when players lined up to play the game.<ref name=":0" />

In North America, the game debuted on 22 July,<ref name="GM265"/> followed by a mass-market release in August.<ref name="ATVGL:JaO1971-2005">{{cite book|last=Akagi|first=Masumi|url=https://archive.org/stream/ArcadeGameList1971-2005#page/n37/mode/1up|title=セガ社 (Sega); Sega; H|work=アーケードTVゲームリスト 国内•海外編 (1971–2005)|edition=1st|publisher=Amusement News Agency|date=13 October 2006|pages=36, 131, 154|isbn=978-4990251215|language=ja}}</ref> It was introduced to the public by the company's American arcade subsidiary, Sega Enterprises USA, headed by Tom Petit. Previously, Sega Enterprises USA had focused on selling refurbished arcade cabinets, and before the release of ''Hang-On'', Petit was concerned that his division would be shut down due to competition when he was summoned to Japan to meet with Sega president [[Hayao Nakayama]] in 1985. Instead, he was brought to be shown the ''Hang-On'' deluxe cabinet. Sega Enterprises USA introduced ''Hang-On'' to Sega's American and Canadian distributors at the Red Lion Inn in [[San Jose, California]] in October 1985.  Orders were placed immediately for several hundred units. The success of ''Hang-On''<nowiki/>'s arcade cabinets, both upright and deluxe, were so great that the company struggled to keep up with demand.<ref name=":0" /> In Europe, the game was released in September,<ref name="CG6"/> and was manufactured by Atari Ireland,<ref name="GM269"/><ref name="hangon_sales"/> a subsidiary of [[Atari Games]] (which in turn was a subsidiary of [[Namco]] at the time), while [[Sega Europe]] of London handled distribution in the region.<ref name="GM269"/>

===Home ports===
A version of the game for the [[SG-1000]] released in 1985 was marketed as a sequel, ''Hang-On II'', though it was essentially a port of the original game simplified to work within the limitations of the console hardware.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Marley|first=Scott|date=December 2016|title=Essential Games: The Titles that Made the SG-1000 Shine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|issue=163|page=58}}</ref> An upgraded port for the [[Master System]] was produced in 1986, and was included as the system's pack-in game along with ''[[Astro Warrior]]'' or ''[[Marksman Shooting & Trap Shooting|Safari Hunt]]'' depending on the package purchased.<ref name=":2" /> An additional arcade version based on the Master System port, titled ''Hang-On Jr.'', was released in 1986 for Sega's System E arcade system board.<ref name=":0" /> The game was also released on the [[MSX]] in 1985.

According to video game journalist Ken Horowitz, ''Hang-On'' is remembered more for its gameplay than its sales, in part because it was unique in arcades at the time, and that it was an example that "when it came to arcade innovation, Sega was at the top of the industry".<ref name=":0" /> Suzuki also considered ''Hang-On'' to be a major milestone in [[video game music]]. He said "there had been games with short tunes and beeps, but I think Hang On was the first game to have a solid composition with a bass and drums".<ref name="Historia"/>
