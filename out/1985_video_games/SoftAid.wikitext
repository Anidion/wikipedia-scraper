'''''SoftAid''''' is a software compilation, released by [[Quicksilva]] in March 1985 to support the [[Famine Relief]] in [[Ethiopia]]. The software was released on [[cassette tape|cassette]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]] home computers.

An audio recording of the [[charity single]], [[Do They Know It's Christmas?]] by [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] also featured on one side of the tape.

The tape was unusual in that it was released to help support a charity (possibly unique in computer gaming at the time). The cover featured artwork by British artist David Rowe,<ref>[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/15/oncover.htm CRASH magazine: The Online Edition] - Features - ON THE COVER - DAVID ROWE, cover artist talks about how he got started illustrating computer games (Issue No. 15 APRIL 1985)</ref>.
