'''''Wriggler''''' is a [[ZX Spectrum|Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC|Amstrad]] maze game published in 1985 by [[Romantic Robot]]. The original release of ''Wriggler'' contained an [[instrumental]] track on the B-side titled "Moons of Jupiter," composed by [[Alexander Goldscheider]].

==Gameplay==
Wriggler is based around maggot racing other maggots. The player controls a maggot and has to escape a maze consisting of 256 screens. The maze is divided into sections: garden, underground, hell, planet surface, the dungeon.

==Development==

The graphics, animation and cassette inlay artwork were created by [[Allin Kempthorne]] while still at school. He went on to become a writer and cartoonist for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper. He later became an actor and comedian, most noted for writing and starring in the comedy feature film ''[[The Vampires of Bloody Island]]''. The Spectrum version was programmed by his twin brother Matthew Kempthorne, and the [[Amstrad CPC|Amstrad]] version was programmed by Matthew Kempthorne and David Vivian. 

A version of Wriggler was developed for the [[Enterprise (computer)|Enterprise]] (ported directly from the [[Amstrad CPC|Amstrad]] version), but not released.

An article on ''The Making of Wriggler'' appeared in issue 114 of ''[[Retro Gamer Magazine]]''. Written by Graeme Mason, it contains interviews with both Matthew and [[Allin Kempthorne]].
