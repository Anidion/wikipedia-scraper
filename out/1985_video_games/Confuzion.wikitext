'''''Confuzion''''' is a [[puzzle game]] developed and published by [[Incentive Software]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[Acorn Electron]]. The object is to guide a spark along a fuse wire. It is similar to the 1982 arcade game ''[[Loco-Motion (video game)|Loco-Motion]].'' ''Confuzion'' was written by Paul Shirley who later wrote ''[[Spindizzy (computer game)|Spindizzy]]''.<ref name=giantlist/>

''[[Zzap!64]]'' magazine considered ''Confuzion'' to be the best arcade-puzzle game available at the time for the Commodore 64.<ref>{{Cite magazine|magazine=[[Zzap!64]]|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=4&page=95&magazine=zzap|title = Zzap Test - Confuzion|date=August 1985|issue=4}}</ref>

==Audio track==
{{Citation style|section|date=September 2019}}

The [[cassette tape]] on which the game was supplied also contained an audio track also titled "Confusion", which was composed by the band Private Property (Matt Smith Lyrics, Joanne Holt/Steve Salt Music) and performed by Joanne Holt, Matt Smith, Steve Salt, Chris Weller and Gary Seaward. [[Rob Hubbard]] translated the original track into the game's soundtrack. Rob Hubbard's version of the music is mentioned in the book Bits and pieces: a history of chiptunes by Kenneth B. McAlpine<ref>Kenneth B. McAlpine (2018) [https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/publications/bits-and-pieces-a-history-of-chiptunes "Bits and pieces: a history of chiptunes"], ''[[Oxford University Press]]'', Oxford. UK.</ref>

The band persuaded [[Incentive Software]] to change their audio cassette duplication process from [[monophonic]] to [[stereophonic]], so that the music could be better appreciated (mono was fine for the computer program data which was distributed on cassette tapes in the 80s).
