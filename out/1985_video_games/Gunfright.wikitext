'''''Gunfright''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Ultimate Play the Game]] and published by [[U.S. Gold]]. It was first released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in December 1985, then released for [[Amstrad CPC]] and the [[MSX]] the following year. The player takes the role of a [[sheriff]] in the town of Black Rock and is tasked with eliminating [[outlaw]]s who are scattered throughout the settlement.

The game was developed directly after ''[[Nightshade (1985 video game)|Nightshade]]'', and re-uses the latter game's [[Filmation (game engine)|Filmation II]] game engine that allows images to be rendered without overlapping each other. The game received mostly positive reviews upon release; praise was directed at the graphics and presentation, but criticism was directed at the game's similarity to ''Nightshade''. It was later included in ''[[Rare Replay]]'', Rare's 2015 [[Xbox One]] retrospective compilation.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Gunfright 1.gif|thumb|left|256px|The interface displays the current wanted outlaw, ammunition count, and overall score.]]
The game is presented in an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] format and set in the fictional town of Black Rock. The player takes on the role of Sheriff Quickdraw, whose main objective is to track down and kill a gang of outlaws who are hiding in the town.<ref name=crash/> The game begins with a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective targeting [[minigame]] in which vertically scrolling bags of money can be shot at using [[crosshair]]s. Shooting the bags give the player initial sums of money which can be used to purchase [[ammunition]].<ref name=crash/>

Sheriff Quickdraw must locate the wanted outlaws one by one. Once an outlaw has been found and shot to initiate a [[duel]], the game shifts to the first-person targeting minigame. This time, the player must shoot the rapidly moving outlaw as quickly as possible. The player can either wait for the outlaw to draw, or take the initiative and shoot first, which will make the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots an outlaw, a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.<ref name=crash/>

Players encounter helpful residents who will point the way to outlaws. The residents need to be protected during gameplay, as the player has to pay a fine if any are shot by either bandits or Sheriff Quickdraw himself. Some outlaws are mounted on horseback, meaning that the player may have to [[Western Saddle|saddle]] a horse [[power-up]] to pursue them.<ref name=crash/><ref name=CG/>

==Development==
The game was developed with the [[isometric projection]] [[game engine]] known as Filmation II, which was used previously in Ultimate's 1985 ZX Spectrum game ''[[Nightshade (1985 video game)|Nightshade]]''.<ref name=scroll>{{cite journal | url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/51/runagain.htm | title=Looking For An Old Angle | publisher=[[Newsfield]] | journal=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] | issue=51 | date=April 1988 | access-date=3 October 2006}}</ref> The Filmation engine was created by the Stamper brothers to portray 3D imagery. Filmation II used an [[image masking]] technique that drew and filled holes in the background, allowing the game to create composite structures out of pixelated drawings without visual overlay, despite the limitations platforms such as the ZX Spectrum offered.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Game Design|journal=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|publisher= [[Newsfield]]|issue=29|date=June 1986|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/29/game_design.htm|access-date=9 September 2015}}</ref>

The game received mostly positive reviews upon release. Reviewers writing for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' praised the game's graphics as highly detailed and "colourful", but stated that the game was visually similar to Ultimate's immediately previous game, ''[[Nightshade (1985 video game)|Nightshade]]''.<ref name=crash/> Gwyn Hughes of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' thought the graphics were the best aspect of the game, despite similarly comparing them to those of ''Nightshade''. Hughes also praised the game's smooth animation and the techniques used to portray the [[wild west|western town]].<ref name=YS/> A reviewer for ''[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]]'' suggested that the game's style and gameplay was a mix of ''Nightshade'' and Nintendo's ''[[Duck Hunt]]''.<ref name=CVG/> Reviewing the [[MSX]] version, a reviewer for ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' praised the game's plot, and was complimentary of the way the game was able to separate itself from Ultimate's previous game, which had used the same [[Filmation (game engine)|Filmation]] engine.<ref name=CG/>

Reviewers writing for ''Crash'' praised the gameplay, stating that the game's "element" was considerably developed and that the several different stages were "highly addictive".<ref name=crash/> Writers in ''CVG'' criticised the gameplay, noting that they found it difficult to distinguish the outlaws from other male inhabitants of the town. They also noted the absence of puzzle elements which was considered "unusual" for an Ultimate game.<ref name=CVG/> Bill Bennett of ''[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]'' similarly considered the omission of puzzle elements unusual, but welcomed the "witty" change in genre from the previous dungeon-themed video games.<ref name=YC>{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=Bill|title=Gunfright review|journal=[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]|publisher=IPC Electrical-Electronic Press|date=February 1986|volume=6|issue=2|page=31|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/YourComputer/Issue8602/Pages/YourComputer860200031.jpg|access-date=9 September 2015}}</ref>
