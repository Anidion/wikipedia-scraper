'''''Alien 8''''' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed and published by [[Ultimate Play the Game]]. It was released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[MSX]] in 1985.{{efn|The game was first released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], and was ported to the other formats later in 1985.}} The game is a [[spiritual successor]] to the best-selling ''[[Knight Lore]]'', which was lauded by critics for its [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric graphics]]. In the game, the player takes control of a robot, Alien 8, whose job is to ensure that all of the [[cryogenics|cryogenically]] frozen passengers on board a starship remain viable during the ship's voyage.

The game was written by Chris Stamper, and graphics were designed by Tim Stamper. ''Alien 8'' uses the same [[image masking]] technique as ''Knight Lore'', which allows the developers to create composite structures out of stacked images without visual overlay. The technique was copyrighted by Ultimate as the [[Filmation engine|Filmation]] game engine. As with its spiritual predecessor, the game is rendered [[isometric projection]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/51/runagain.htm | title=Looking For An Old Angle | publisher=Newsfield | work=Crash Magazine, Issue 51 | access-date=2006-10-03| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060924030425/http://www.crashonline.org.uk/51/runagain.htm| archive-date= 24 September 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> The game was critically acclaimed upon release. Reviewers praised the game's graphics and innovation, while minor criticism was directed at its similarities to ''Knight Lore''.

==Plot==
On a dying planet in a distant galaxy, the last of the creatures known as the "guardians" stored all of their libraries, records, and knowledge on a single starship together with [[Cryopreservation|cryogenically preserved]] members of their race. A single robot, Alien 8, is tasked with keeping the occupants of the vessel alive for the duration of its journey.

The ship is launched towards a new solar system and Alien 8 performs his task for thousands of years during the journey. However, as the ship nears its destination, it is attacked and boarded by hostile aliens. The cryogenic life support systems were damaged during the attack and Alien 8 must restore them to an operational status before the ship's automatic thrusting systems manoeuvre it into planetary orbit.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Alien 8 3.gif|thumb|left|The interface displays how many [[light year]]s the starship is from its destination (ZX Spectrum).]]

The game is presented in an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] format and set on board a [[starship]]. Taking on the role of the [[robot]], ''Alien 8'', the player must explore the large starship in order to ensure that the cryogenic [[life support system]]s preserving the biological crew are re-activated.<ref name=retro/> The core of this system is a series of [[geometry|geometrically]]-shaped [[Electrical network|circuits]]. However, the circuits have been removed by the invading aliens and distributed around the starship. The main objective of the game is to collect the correct circuits and return them to their respective locations before the starship reaches its destination. The circuits are variously shaped as cubes, pyramids, domes or cylinders.

As with its spiritual predecessor, the environment of the game takes the form of a series of isometric [[flip-screen]] rooms (which trace the outline of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms<ref name=crash/> and most are filled with various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens.<ref name=SU/> As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature is the use of [[remote control]]led drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.<ref name=PC/>

==Development==
Development of ''Alien 8'' began immediately after the release of ''[[Knight Lore]]'', in which the Stamper brothers predicted that publishers would attempt to copy ''Knight Lore''{{'s}} [[Filmation (game engine)|Filmation]] technology in other games.<ref name=retro>{{cite journal|title=The Ultimate Hero: A History of Sabreman|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=March 2009|issue=73|pages=24–28|url=http://scans.bytemaniacos.com/en/retro_gamer/Retro_Gamer_Issue_073.pdf|access-date=3 October 2015|publisher=[[Future plc]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004151212/http://scans.bytemaniacos.com/en/retro_gamer/Retro_Gamer_Issue_073.pdf|archive-date=4 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As with its predecessor, the Stamper brothers developed the game in [[monochrome]] to avoid visual overlay and [[attribute clash]], as it was a common processing limitation in early [[8-bit]] home computers.<ref name=retro/><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Games Index – Knight Lore |journal=[[Amtix]] |issue=1 |date = November 1985|page=102 |ref={{harvid|Amtix|1985}} |url=https://archive.org/stream/amtix-magazine-01/Amtix_01_Nov_1985#page/n101/mode/1up}}</ref> However, the Amstrad release exclusively displayed dual-colours.<ref name=amtix/>
