'''''Wishbringer: The Magick Stone of Dreams''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] video game written by [[Brian Moriarty]] and published by [[Infocom]] in 1985. It was intended to be an easier game to solve than the typical Infocom release and provide a good introduction to interactive fiction for inexperienced players, and was well received.

==Plot==
The player's character is a postal clerk in the small fishing village of Festeron. The cranky postmaster, Mr. Crisp, orders the player to deliver an important envelope to the proprietor of [[Ye olde|Ye Olde]] Magick Shoppe. The proprietor asks the player to rescue her cat from a mysterious sorceress known only as The Evil One. Stepping out of the store, the player finds that quaint Festeron has mysteriously been transformed into a more sinister town called Witchville. There are but a few hours to defeat The Evil One.

==Gameplay==
A player can solve ''Wishbringer'' by using the wishing stone, then play it again without using it to get a higher score.{{r|maher20140410}} A few Infocom games have puzzles with multiple solutions (for example, the "Loud Room" from ''[[Zork]]''). However, ''Wishbringer'' has several such puzzles, many of which can be solved either in a straightforward (that is, non-magical) manner or by using one of the stone's wishes. The game can be successfully completed without using any wishes: At the Congratulations screen, the game informs the player of this fact, if the player had used any wishes. Conversely, it is impossible to finish the game using all of the stone's wishes (wishing for flight invariably causes the game to be lost.)

==Development==
The work on ''Wishbringer'' began in 1984<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/amiga-world-1986-01/Amiga_World_Vol_02_01_1986_Jan_Feb#page/n73/mode/2up/ |title=Amiga World Magazine (January 1986) |website=Archive.org |date=January 1986 |access-date=2016-02-06}}</ref> when Infocom marketing requested an easy game to introduce customers to text adventures. Moriarty suggested adding a magic ring, then a magic rock, to the package, then began writing the game based on the rock. Because it sold well, Moriarty mentioned in July 1986 that a sequel was forthcoming,<ref name="scorpia198611">{{cite magazine | title=Designer Profiles / Brian Moriarty | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1986 | author=Moriarty, Brian | page=16}}</ref> but none appeared.

The relations of the Wishbringer objects to the wishes are described in the [[feelies]], as a form of [[copy protection]]. When Infocom games were later repackaged by Activision, the information in the feelies had to be reproduced in printed form. Included in the ''Wishbringer'' package are several items, which Infocom called feelies: a book, ''The Legend of Wishbringer'', that explains how the magic stone came to be (in the Solid Gold release, an in-game object included in the player's starting inventory instead of the packaging); the envelope and letter to be delivered to Ye Olde Magick Shoppe; a "postal zone map" of Festeron; and a plastic glow-in-the-dark replica of the stone.

==Reception==
''Wishbringer'' was very well received.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spagmag.org/archives/w.html#wishbringer |title=Game Reviews W - SPAG |website=Spagmag.org |access-date=2016-02-06}}</ref> Infocom sold about 75,000 copies in the first six months; it was the company's fifth best-selling game, selling about 150,000 copies in total.<ref name="maher20140410">{{Cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2014/04/wishbringer/ |title=Wishbringer |last=Maher |first=Jimmy |date=2014-04-10 |website=The Digital Antiquarian}}</ref>

According to ''[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]'', it is "all great stuff.
