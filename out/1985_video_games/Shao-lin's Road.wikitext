The game was also released as a download-only title as part of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Game Room]] for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in [[2010 in video gaming|2010]], as well as [[Hamster Corporation]]'s ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in [[2023 in video gaming|2023]].

==Plot==
Players take control of {{nihongo|Wanpyou|ワンピョウ}} (renamed Kicker in ''Kicker'', renamed Lee in other ports), who has just mastered the secret of Chin-style [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin]] martial arts. He then encounters the Triad {{nihongo|Yamucha Gang|ヤムチャ団}}, also responsible for the assassination of his master {{nihongo|Raochuu|ラオチュー}}, and is trapped within their {{nihongo|Jaken Temple|邪拳寺}}. He attempts to escape and enact revenge with his new-found skills.

==Gameplay==
The controls consist of a four-position [[joystick]] and two buttons. The goal of each [[level (video gaming)|level]] ("step") is to defeat a set number of enemies, as indicated by an on-screen meter. The player can move left or right, jump between platforms/floors, and attack with various jumping/kicking strikes.

Enemies emerge from doorways to attack the player; some fight hand-to-hand, while others throw projectiles. Defeating a green-clad enemy causes a colored sphere to appear, which grants the player one of three [[power-up]] weapons for a few seconds if caught: a [[meteor hammer]], the ability to throw fireballs, or a ball that orbits the player and damages any enemy it touches. Food items occasionally float across the screen and can be struck for bonus points.

The player can take three hits from enemies or their projectiles and continue fighting, but a fourth hit costs one life. Each step is divided into two parts; the second half includes a fight against a boss character, who requires five hits to defeat and may have a special attack technique. Once all enemies in either half of a step are defeated, the player earns bonus points based on the number of hits taken in that half and the damage meter is fully restored.

The game includes a total of five different step designs, which repeat in a cycle with increasing difficulty. Once all lives are lost, the game ends.
