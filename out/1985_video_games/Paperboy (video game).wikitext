'''''Paperboy''''' is an [[arcade game|arcade]] [[action game]] developed and published by [[Atari Games]],<ref name=history/> and released in 1985.<ref name="atari_production99"/> The player takes the role of a [[paperboy]] who delivers a fictional newspaper called ''The Daily Sun'' along a street on his bicycle.<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8977 |title=Paperboy |publisher  =The International Arcade Museum |access-date =5 Oct 2013}}</ref> The arcade version of the game featured bike handlebars as the controller.<ref name =rgamer>{{citation | title=The Ultimate Guide to Paperboy | journal=Retro Gamer | author=Mike Bevan| issue=125 | pages=21–29 | date= 6 February 2014 |publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]] }}</ref>

The game was ported to many home systems beginning in 1986. A sequel for home computers and consoles, ''[[Paperboy 2]]'', was released in 1991.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC Paperboy.png|thumb|left|Set in the United States,<ref name =rgamer /><ref name="retrogamer39">{{cite magazine |title=The Making of Paperboy|magazine=Retro Gamer|issue=39|publisher=Imagine|date=21 June 2007|author=Darran Jones|pages=28–33|url=|access-date=}}</ref> the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street.]]
The player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or [[oblique projection]]) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house. If the player loses all of their lives, or runs out of subscribers, the game ends.

The game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way.  The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends.  The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.<ref name = "ahist">{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?page=detail&id=1935 |title=Paperboy The [Coin-Op] Arcade Video Game by Atari Games Corp. [Milpitas, CA, USA]| publisher=arcade-history.com|access-date=2014-06-28 }}</ref>

Controlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.<ref name = "rgamer"/>

==Development==
The cabinet is a standard upright but with custom controls. The controls consist of a [[bicycle handlebar]] (a modified ''[[Star Wars (1983 video game)#Arcade details|Star Wars]]'' [[Yoke (aircraft)|yoke]])<ref name = "rgamer"/> with one button on each side, used to throw papers. The handlebars can be pushed forward to accelerate and pulled back to brake.

The game runs on the [[Atari System 2]] hardware. The CPU is a 10&nbsp;MHz [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) [[DEC T-11|T-11]]. For sound and coin inputs, it uses a 2.2&nbsp;MHz [[MOS Technology 6502]]. The sound chips are two [[Atari POKEY|POKEY]]s for digital sound, a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] [[YM2151]] for music, and a [[Texas Instruments]] [[TMS5220]] for speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=atari-system-2&page=detail&id=82057 |title=Atari System 2| publisher=arcade-history.com|access-date=2014-06-28 }}</ref> The protection chip is a Slapstic model 137412-105.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aarongiles.com/slapstic.html | title=Atari Slapstic FAQ | access-date=2014-06-28 }}</ref>

The game program code for the arcade version was written in [[BLISS]].<ref>{{Citation|last=GDC|title=Classic Game Postmortem: Paperboy|date=2019-05-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MREsJsRZqu0|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>
