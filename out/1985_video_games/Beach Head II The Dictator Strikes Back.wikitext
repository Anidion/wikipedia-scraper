''Beach-Head II'' features the [[Player character|player]] pursuing the eponymous Dictator in several ways. There are four [[Level (video games)|levels]] in the game. In the first level, called Attack,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ZZap64Issue0321987Dec/page/n135/mode/2up?view=theater|title=ZZap_64_Issue_032_1987_Dec}}</ref> the player deploys soldiers along a path with walls to cover him from the dictator's gun. The objective is to destroy the gun. The second level involves rescuing the prisoners from deadly obstacles by clearing them with a gun. The third level's objective is to escape from the area by flying a [[helicopter]] with the prisoners out of the dictator's fortress. Finally the player and the dictator face off, on opposite cliffs, separated by water. To defeat him, the player must make him fall in the water by throwing knives at him. The Dictator tries to do the same to the player.

In [[Single-player|one-player mode]] there are three [[Difficulty level|skill levels]], harder modes resulting in faster movements and the computer opponent using better [[artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-004/page/n21/mode/2up?view=theater|title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 004|date=August 1985}}</ref> In two-player mode, one player controls the usual side whilst his opponent controls the Dictator's forces.<ref name="Commodore User Magazine Issue 22">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-user-magazine-22/page/n26/mode/1up?view=theater|title = Commodore User Magazine Issue 22|date = July 1985}}</ref>

This game was notable for using [[synthesized speech]] (courtesy of [[Electronic Speech Systems]], then of [[Berkeley, California]]). Known for its deathly scream (also heard in [[Epyx]]'s ''[[Impossible Mission]]''), laughing, "I'm hit",<ref name="Commodore User Magazine Issue 22"/> "Medic", "Hey! Don't shoot me" and "You can't hurt me".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-004/page/n19/mode/2up?view=theater|title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 004|date=August 1985}}</ref>

''[[Ahoy!]]'' reviewed the Commodore 64 version of ''Beach Head II'', and stated that the first minigame, "Attack", was the best, but criticized the illogic of a player who chooses to control the Dictator still having to ferry people to safety in "Rescue". The review summarized ''Beach-Head II'' as "one of the best head-to-head games for the Commodore, and the computer makes a powerful solitaire opponent".<ref name=ahoy>{{cite magazine|title =Reviews: Beach-Head II |date =October 1985 |url =https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_22_1985-10_Ion_International_US#page/n61/mode/2up |magazine =[[Ahoy!]] |publisher =Ion International |last =Katz |first =Arnie |issue =22 |pages =63–64}}</ref> ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' was more critical, calling the Atari version of the game 'mediocre', with "acceptable" graphics and "little action".<ref name=analog>{{cite magazine|title =Panak Strikes! - Reviews of the latest software - Beach-Head II |date =December 1986 |url =https://archive.org/stream/analog-computing-magazine-49/Analog_Computing_49_1986-12_8_Bit_Gift_Guide#page/n113/mode/2up |magazine =[[ANALOG Computing]] |publisher =ANALOG 400/800 Corp. |last =Panak |first =Steve|issue =49 |page =97|issn=0744-9917}}</ref>

''[[Zzap!64]]'' gave the Commodore 64 version of the game an overall score of 90%, calling it an improvement over its predecessor, and praised its "fantastic" graphics, "state-of-the-art" animations, and "first-class" synthesized speech. ''Zzap!'' praised ''Beach Head II's'' "varied" and "fun" action arcade gameplay, as well as its two-player mode, further calling the game "an absolute must".<ref name=zzap>{{cite magazine|title =Zzap!

''Crash'' further criticized ''Beach Head II'', expressing that while its graphics are "crude", they work well, further stating that the Commodore 64 version's best qualities are its speech and graphics, which are missing in the Spectrum port, leaving a "pretty simple and boring game".<ref name=crash>{{cite magazine|title =Reviews: Beach Head II |date =January 1986 |url =https://archive.org/details/crash-magazine-24/page/n11/mode/2up |magazine =[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |publisher =Newsfield Limited |issue =24 |page =13}}</ref>
