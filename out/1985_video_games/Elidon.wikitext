'''''Elidon''''' is a 1985 [[action game]] developed and published by Orpheus for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[MSX]] computers.

==Gameplay==
Elidon is a flip-screen (or flick-screen) platform game. The player controls a flying Faerie using the keyboard or joystick. When the Faerie reaches the edge of the current screen, it will 'flip' to the next screen, a common technique in 1980s home computers.<ref>{{cite web |author=Giant Bomb |title=Flip Screen (Concept) |url=https://www.giantbomb.com/flip-screen/3015-2123/ |website=Giant Bomb |access-date=2023-06-12}}</ref>

The player must avoid the nasties and obstacles which drain the Faerie's energy. A wand can be used to remove the nasties. The Faerie can only hold three collectables at a time.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MobyGames |title=Elidon (1985) |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/63121/elidon/ |website=MobdyGames |access-date=2023-06-12}}</ref>
