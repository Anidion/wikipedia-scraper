The object of ''Kissin' Kousins'' is to guide a little boy from left to right through ten dangerous screens while avoiding many obstacles, both stationary and moving. On reaching the right edge, the background scrolls to the next screen. Obstacles are related to the background: in the city (the first few screens), the player must avoid brick walls, hydrants, and garbage cans. As the player delves deeper into the forest, the obstacles turn into bugs, worms and toadstools. The player also has a pistol, which can be used to shoot at short distances. To increase the difficulty level, a bomb-dropping plane flies overhead, and each screen must be completed in a strict time limit. 

If the player hits an obstacle, is blown up by a bomb, or runs out of time, they lose a life and must start the game over from the last screen. The player starts with five lives, and when all are lost, the game is over.
