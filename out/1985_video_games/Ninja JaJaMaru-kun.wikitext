==Gameplay==
[[Image:Ninja Jajamaru Screenshot1.JPG|thumb|left|JaJaMaru-kun has stunned an enemy at the center of the screen in the first level of the game.]]

In ''Ninja JaJaMaru-kun'', the player takes control of JaJaMaru, who sets out to rescue Princess Sakura from the pirate lord Namazu Dayuu, or "Catfish Pirate".<ref name="IGN"/><ref name="HG101"/> JaJaMaru can run, jump, and throw shurikens at enemies, all of which are taken from [[List of legendary creatures from Japan|Japanese folklore]] and are introduced before a level begins.<ref name="HG101"/> Each level has eight enemies total, who give chase to JaJaMaru if he occupies the same floor as them. Defeating enemies will cause their spirit to appear and ascend to the top of the screen, which can be grabbed for additional points. Once all the enemies are defeated, JaJaMaru moves onto the next level.

JaJaMaru can destroy bricks scattered in levels, some of which yield power-ups when destroyed. These include a cart that temporarily makes JaJaMaru invincible, a bottle that allows him to walk through enemies, a red ball that increases speed, coins that yield extra points, and 1UPs. Some bricks contain bombs which will kill JaJaMaru if he touches it. Collecting three different power-ups will summon a giant frog named Gamapa-kun, who JaJaMaru will ride and be completely invincible and be able to eat any nearby enemies. During levels, Sakura will sometimes drop flower petals that can be collected for points, while Namazu will drop deadly bombs. Collecting three petals will transport JaJaMaru to a bonus level, where he must throw shhurikens upward towards Namazu while avoiding his bombs. Bonus points are awarded for hitting Namazu, while hitting a bomb will send the player to the next level instead.

By April 1986, it had sold nearly 1 million units, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling Nintendo Entertainment System video games|best-selling Famicom games]].<ref name="GM"/> In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''VS. Ninja JaJaMaru-kun'' on their May 15, 1986 issue as being the fifteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=284|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 May 1986|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>

Digital re-releases of ''Ninja JaJaMaru-kun'' have received a mediocre reception. ''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the game for its simplicity and lacking in its gameplay, which they attributed to the lack of variety between levels and for the intelligence of the enemies remaining the same as the game progressed.<ref name="GSpot"/> While they praised the game for its easy-to-know controls and good music for an early point in the system's life, they said that it was a generally unappealing-looking game and that its gameplay was tedious and boring, mockingly commenting: "''Ninja Jajamaru-kun'' is tedious and ugly, and it actually induces physical discomfort. You'd have to be crazy to dole out six dollars to subject yourself to this kind of pain".<ref name="GSpot"/> ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' was more positive towards the game, saying that its simplicity actually made the game fun to play.<ref name="NLife"/> In light of this, they criticized its high difficulty level and repetitive soundtrack.<ref name="NLife"/> They commented that the game was worth the purchase simply for the fact it had previously remained confined to Japan, but warned potential buyers of its overly-high difficulty.<ref name="NLife"/> ''[[IGN]]'' said that, while cute, the game was "quaint at best", and that its simplistic gameplay and lack of a true progression through levels would easily bore players.<ref name="IGN"/> They also felt confused towards the game's high price point, which they stated was needlessly-high and made it difficult to recommend.<ref name="IGN"/>

In a 2011 retrospective review, ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' stated that while ''Ninja JaJaMaru-kun'' was a fun game, namely with the amount of ways to defeat the enemies, it suffered from choppy sprite animation and stiff controls, although claimed the latter was a significant improvement over the Family Computer port of ''[[Ninja-Kid]]''.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Ninja JaJaMaru-kun |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ninja-jajamaru-kun/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=7 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121000722/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ninja-jajamaru-kun/ |archive-date=21 November 2019 |date=11 July 2011}}</ref> They said that it had several cute touches, such as the Catfish Pirate laughing at the player at the beginning of each level, and that the music, while repetitive, was catchy and memorable.<ref name="HG101"/> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' called it  "a primative, challenging Japanese platformer which becomes a bore quickly", criticizing the game's controls, simplicity, and for the gameplay being boring and lacking in variety.<ref name="RGamer"/> They also wrote that its quality "has the feel of an NES arcade game port in a way", comparing it unfavorably to games like ''[[Ghosts'n Goblins]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''.<ref name="RGamer">{{cite web |author1=Retro Gamer Team |title=Ninja JaJaMaru-kun |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/ninja-jajamaru-kun/ |website=[[Retro Gamer]] |accessdate=7 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912173310/https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/ninja-jajamaru-kun/ |archive-date=12 September 2015 |date=2 July 2010}}</ref>
