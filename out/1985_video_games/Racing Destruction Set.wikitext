The game is a one or two-player game played with joysticks.

The player can create different race tracks using a variety of templates. The player can create ramps and elevation changes in the layout of the track as well. The builder also has the options to change the type of terrain - laying slippery ice stretches of track, normal track, or difficult sandy sections of track.

For a particular race, the player can change a variety of features. The player can alter the gravity to reflect gravity on different planets or the moon. The player has the option of changing which vehicle they want to race in and make customized changes to the tires, engine and other aspects of the vehicle. The vehicles available are a [[Can-Am]] [[sports car]], a [[Jeep]], a [[Lunar Rover]], a [[dirt bike]], a [[baja bug]], a [[Pickup truck|pickup]], a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|Sting Ray]], a [[stock car]], a [[Sport bike|street bike]], and an [[Open wheel car|indy/grand prix]] car.<ref>{{cite web

The racing uses [[split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]]. Player 1 controls the red car on the top screen, and player 2 controls the yellow car on the bottom screen. The races have an option for racing mode or destruction mode. In racing mode, a number of laps are chosen and the quickest to complete them is the winner. In destruction mode, each player has access to [[oil slick]]s and [[landmine]]s which can be ejected from the back of the vehicles.

==Development==
The game was written by Rick Koenig, with art by Connie Goldman and music by David Warhol.<ref>{{cite web |title="Racing Destruction Set" Box Inside Right Copy Scan |url=https://archive.org/details/racing-destruction-set-box-inside-right-electronic-arts/Racing_Destruction_Set_box_inside_right_Electronic_Arts.jpg |website=Archive.org |year=1985 |access-date=6 May 2023}}.</ref>
Koenig, Goldman and Warhol had all worked for the [[Intellivision]] [[game design]] team at [[Mattel]] during the early 1980s, where Koenig had programmed the Intellivision ''Motocross'' game. When Intellivision Director of [[Game development|Game Development]] [[Don Daglow]] left Mattel and joined Electronic Arts as a Producer in late 1983, he reunited Koenig, Goldman and Warhol on ''Racing Destruction Set'' at EA.
