{{nihongo|'''''The Legend of Kage'''''|影の伝説|Kage no Densetsu}} is a [[side-scrolling]] [[hack-and-slash]] game developed and published by [[Taito]] in 1985. In this game, the player controls the ninja Kage, with the objective being to get through five stages in order to save the princess Kirihime. These stages are littered with enemies, but Kage has various skills and weapons on his hands in order to get through them.

The arcade release was considered a success for Taito, and exceeded sales expectations at the time of its release. It has been ported to a variety of home systems, has had sequels and spinoffs, and has been featured on various Taito compilations.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Lkage.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]
The player takes the role of a young [[Iga-ryū|Iga]] [[ninja]] named Kage ("Shadow"), on a mission to rescue Princess Kiri (hime) - the Shogun's daughter - from the villainous warlord Yoshi (ro Kuyigusa) and fellow evil samurai Yuki (nosuke Riko). The player is armed with a [[kodachi]] shortsword and an unlimited number of [[shuriken]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Legend of Kage, The – Hardcore Gaming 101 |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/legend-of-kage-the/ |access-date=2021-10-17 |language=en-US}}</ref> Kage must fight his way through a forest, along a secret passageway, up a fortress wall, and through a castle, rescuing her twice (three times in the FC/NES version) in order to win the game.<ref name=":0" /> Each time the princess is rescued, the seasons change from summer to fall to winter and back to summer.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Citation |last=M.

In home versions, grabbing a crystal ball causes the player's clothes to change to the next level in color and thereby attain certain powers (bigger shuriken or faster speed).<ref name=":1" /> If Kage is hit in a home version while in green or orange clothes, he does not die but reverts to his normal red clothes.<ref name=":1" />

Cycles repeat after five levels are completed, and play continues until all lives are gone, which ends the game.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

== Development and release ==
''The Legend of Kage'' was released by Taito in Japan in 1985, with a European release later in the year, and an American release in January 1986.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

According to Hisayoshi Ogura, the game's composer, development came after a fast-paced period of game development within Taito, where it eased up around this game.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=初のFM音源を使った『影の伝説』で自由に手腕を発揮！ 小倉久佳音画制作所×安藤武博対談【サウンドコンポーザーに訊く！／連載第9回・前編】 |url=http://sisilala.tv/myarticles/421 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221004141743/http://sisilala.tv/myarticles/421 |archive-date=4 October 2022 |access-date=4 September 2023 |website=シシララTV |language=ja}}</ref> Ogura specifically gave the game's music a distinct Japanese feeling in order for it to fit in better with the setting of the game, and he felt it was a worthy challenge for him to be able to adapt it to the sound hardware.<ref name=":3" /> Earlier versions of the game used a sound board based around the MSM5232, the same chip found on synths such as the ''[[Korg Poly-800]]'',<ref name=":3" /> but an FM version of the soundtrack was also produced given Ogura's experimentation with FM sound at the time.<ref name=":3" /> This proved to be helpful as the final version of the game used an FM sound board.<ref name=":3" /> The game was almost shelved, but after it was placed in a game show, it was highly praised and Taito decided to give the game a full release due to the positive reception.<ref name=":3" />

==Reception==
''Game Machine'' of Japan listed ''The Legend of Kage'' on their [[1985 in video games|November 15, 1985]] issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref name=":2">{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=272|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 November 1985|page=21|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19851115p.pdf#page=11}}</ref> According to Ogura, there were around 6,000 kits of the game sold, and this was considered a success within the company.<ref name=":3" />

The Commodore 64 port received a mixed review from ''[[Commodore User]]'' magazine, criticizing the graphics, sound, controls and price, scoring it 5 out of 10. The magazine also said ''Legend of Kage'' was heavily influenced by [[Konami]]'s [[beat 'em up]] game ''[[Shao-lin's Road]]'', released earlier the same year.<ref name="CU">{{cite magazine|title=Legend of Kage|magazine=[[Commodore User]]|date=20 December 1986|issue=40 (January 1987)|pages=4, 29|url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-user-magazine-40/page/n3}}</ref> The NES/Famicom port of the game received negative feedback.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The Famicom/NES version was re-released on the [[Wii Virtual Console]] in Japan on December 19, 2006, and in the United States on February 19, 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_kd/|title = VC影の伝説}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/KeAEUuryiYE6ptB6DKjkThz6hi0lDCiP|title=Legend of Kage, The at Nintendo :: Games|website=www.nintendo.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122235004/http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/KeAEUuryiYE6ptB6DKjkThz6hi0lDCiP|archive-date=2010-11-22}}</ref> It was also released for the [[3DS Virtual Console]] and [[Wii U Virtual Console]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/50010000019595|title = 影の伝説 {{!}} ニンテンドー3DS {{!}} 任天堂}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000005405|title = 影の伝説 {{!}} Wii U {{!}} 任天堂}}</ref> The arcade version also appears in the compilation title ''[[Taito Legends 2]]''.

A [[3D computer graphics|3D]] remake of the arcade game along with the original arcade version is included in the 2006 compilation ''[[Taito Legends Power Up]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game is still side-scrolling.

''The Revised Legend of Kage'' was included in the ''[[Let's! TV Play Classic|Taito Nostalgia 1]]'' release along with the original game. It features two new playable characters, Ayame and Ganin. Ayame is a ninja who can throw bombs similar to the red ninja in the game and has an unlimited supply of throwing knives. Ganin is a dog who can breathe fire similar to the monks in the game and can perform a spin attack that does not have much range but leaves him invulnerable for an instant and kills any enemy that touches him. There is also a new final boss that all the characters face which is a giant green cobra that slithers on the ground back and forth on the screen at the end of each second run through the levels. It is the only enemy that does not jump into the air.

===Sequel===
{{main|The Legend of Kage 2}}
A follow-up game was developed by Lancarse for the [[Nintendo DS]], and published by Taito in 2008. Taito's parent company, [[Square Enix]], published a North American localization of the game later that year.<ref>{{Citation|last=Harris|first=Craig|title=Legend of Kage 2 Review - IGN|date=20 October 2008|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/20/legend-of-kage-2-review|publication-date=2009-10-20|language=en|access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref>
