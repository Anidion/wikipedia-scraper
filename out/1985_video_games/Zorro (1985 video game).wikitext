==Gameplay==

The player's task is, as the title character, to get to the heavily guarded fort and free his beloved from the clutches of the evil Sergeant Garcia. Gameplay is very similar to another Datasoft platformer - [[Bruce Lee (video game)|Bruce Lee]], however ''Zorro'' has a slower pace and more puzzles. These mainly involve collecting items from a specific room in the city, then carrying them and using them in the appropriate place (such as heating up a branding iron in a fireplace and using it on a bull). The game features 20 different locations, including catacombs under the city, an underground lake, and The Ole Hotel.
