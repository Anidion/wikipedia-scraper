==Reception==
Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Bop 'N Wrestle'' is a game with some stunning graphics. It is also a well-timed release now that championship wrestling is now a network staple. But, unfortunately, it is a game that tries to do too much."<ref name="CGW30">{{cite magazine |last=Teverbaugh |first=Rick |title=Sports Scoreboard |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=August 1986 |volume=1 |issue=30 |pages=21}}</ref>
