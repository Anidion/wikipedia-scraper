{{nihongo foot|'''''Gradius'''''|グラディウス|Guradiusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[side-scrolling shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Konami]]. The first game in the [[Gradius|''Gradius'' series]], it was originally released as a coin-operated [[arcade game]] in 1985. The player maneuvers a spacecraft known as the Vic Viper that must defend itself from the various alien enemies. The game uses a power-up system called the "power meter", based upon collecting capsules to purchase additional weapons.

The arcade version of ''Gradius'' was initially released internationally outside Japan under the title of '''''Nemesis''''', but subsequent home releases have since used the original title. During development, it had the working title '''''Scramble 2''''', as it was originally intended to be a follow-up to Konami's earlier shooter ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' (1981). Home versions were released for various platforms, such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]], the [[MSX]] home computer, and the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]]. It was a major [[1986 in video games|success in 1986]], becoming the year's highest-grossing arcade game in [[London]] and one of Japan's top five table arcade games, while the Famicom port sold over a million copies in Japan that year.

''Gradius'' was critically acclaimed for its gameplay and unique power-up system. Along with Namco's ''[[Xevious]]'', it is cited as being one of the most important shooter games, having paved the way for many similar games to follow.<ref name="Gamasutra">{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=The history of Gradius: A look back at 30 years of Konami shooting |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/242336/The_history_of_Gradius_A_look_back_at_30_years_of_Konami_shooting.php |website=[[Gamasutra]] |publisher=[[UBM Technology Group]] |access-date=November 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108095051/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/242336/The_history_of_Gradius_A_look_back_at_30_years_of_Konami_shooting.php |archive-date=November 8, 2020 |date=April 30, 2015}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:gradius 04.png|thumb|left|The player's ship, the Vic Viper, exchanging shots with enemy Moai in the game's third stage. The player's power meter is towards the bottom of the screen.]]

The player controls the trans-dimensional [[Spacecraft|spaceship]] [[Vic Viper]] and must battle waves of enemies through various environments.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gradius – Hardcore Gaming 101|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/gradius/|access-date=2021-12-08|language=en-US}}</ref> The game became synonymous with the phrase, "Destroy the core!", as the standard of boss battles in the ''Gradius'' series involved combat with a giant craft, in the center of which would be situated one to several blue colored spheres. These bosses would be designed in such a way that there would be a straight passage from the exterior of the giant craft which leads directly to one of these cores. The player must fire shots into this passage while avoiding attack patterns from weapon emplacements on the body of the boss. However, small but destructible walls are situated in this passage, impeding the bullet shots from damaging the core, and must be whittled away by repeated well-placed shots. In a way, these tiny walls represent the boss' shielding gauge until its core is finally vulnerable to attack. Some bosses can regenerate these walls. When the core has sustained enough hits, it usually changes color from blue to red, indicating that it is in critical condition and its destruction is imminent. Upon the destruction of a core, a piece of the boss may be put out of commission, seeing that it is no longer powered by a core, or if all of the cores are destroyed, the entire boss is defeated and explodes satisfyingly. Note that these cores are not present on the more organic bosses of ''Gradius''. Such bosses have weak spots in places such as a mouth, head or eye.

When [[gameplay]] begins, the Vic Viper is relatively slow and has only a weak gun. This level of capability is generally insufficient for engaging enemies, but the Vic Viper can gain greater capabilities by collecting and using [[power-up]] items. While most arcade games utilize distinct power up-items that each correspond to a specific effect on the [[player character]], ''Gradius'' has a single power-up item. The effect of this power-up item is to advance the currently selected item in a power-up menu that appears at the bottom of the screen. When the desired power-up is highlighted, the player can obtain it by pressing the power-up button, returning the menu to its initial state in which no power-up is highlighted.

==Development==
''Gradius'' was the creation of [[Konami]] game designer Machiguchi Hiroyasu, being the first video game he publicly released.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews">{{cite web |title=Machiguchi Hiroyasu Gradius Interviews (Translated) |url=http://shmuplations.com/gradius-machiguchi/ |website=Shmuplations |access-date=8 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729084921/http://shmuplations.com/gradius-machiguchi/ |archive-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> Joining the company in the early 1980s originally as a programmer, Konami was trying to transition from being a producer of medal machines to a video game developer and assigned him to a small team to try and create a game that could put the company on the map.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> He asked the team what kind of game they'd like to work on, responding that they'd like to make another shooting game.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> The shoot'em up genre had seen a resurgence at the time with [[Namco]]'s ''[[Xevious]]'', with the goal of the project being to make a shooter that could surpass it.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> The project was at first intended to be a followup to Konami's earlier game ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' (1981), being titled ''Scramble 2'' and reusing many of its material and game mechanics.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/>

Development of ''Gradius'' lasted for about a year, which Hiroyasu says was filled with anxiety and worry from the production team due to it being their first game, lacking confidence in what they were doing.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> Members of the project came up with ideas that were then tested on the arcade monitor to see if they worked or not.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> While designing the Option satellites, the team tested over 20 different movement patterns for them, which were cut through the process of elimination based on those that didn't work.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> The game was produced for the [[Bubble System|Konami Bubble System]] 16-bit arcade hardware, which gave the team more hardware capacity and memory to experiment with.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> Hiroyasu wanted the game to have a visually distinct world with unique enemies and locations, something relatively uncommon for shooters at the time.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> Inspiration for mechanics and the story were derived from films such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: A New Hope]]'' and ''[[Lensman]]'', with the Laser weapon being directly taken from those in ''Lensman''.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> The idea for the power meter mechanic stemmed from the team's desire to give players the freedom to select whichever weapons they pleased.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> Early versions had the player collecting individual pick-up icons, which were cut for not being "satisfying" enough; it was instead replaced with a selection bar where players collected capsules to allow access to other weapons, an idea based on the function keys on a keyboard.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/> The [[Moai]] enemies were added to pay homage to ''Xevious'' and its [[Nazca lines]], and as a way to give the game a sense of mystery.<ref name="Hiroyasu Interviews"/>

==Releases==
===Arcade===
''Gradius'' was first released in [[Japan]] for Konami's [[Bubble System]], an arcade board which allows operators to change the software through the use of proprietary "Bubble Software" cartridge media based on magnetic [[bubble memory]]. The game was distributed as a standard [[printed circuit board]] in North America and Europe under the title of ''Nemesis''.<ref name=cashbox>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox50unse_23/page/n51?q=nemesis|title=Year in Review|magazine=Cashbox|date=January 17, 1987}}</ref> The North American version of ''Nemesis'' features a considerably increased difficulty compared to the Japanese and European version. To balance this, the game spawns a fleet of orange enemies when the player loses a life to provide as many power-up capsules as possible to recover as many upgrades as possible. Also the North American version presents a continue feature (but only for three times). The title screen was also updated, showing an in-game reproduction of the promotional artwork behind the logo.

===Famicom/NES===
The first home conversion of ''Gradius'' was released for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Famicom]] console on April 25, 1986, in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-konami-code-celebrates-its-35th-anniversary-today/ |title=The Konami Code celebrates its 35th anniversary today |first=Chris |last=Scullion |date=25 April 2021 |website=[[Video Games Chronicle]] |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref> Due to the hardware limitations of the Famicom, many of the level designs were simplified (the Moai stage, for example, lacks the vertical scrolling present in the arcade game) and the maximum amount of options that the player can upgrade to was reduced from four to two. This version added a cheat code that can be entered while the game is paused that grants the player's ship almost all the power-ups. This code would appear again in many later Konami on the NES and other consoles (such as ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]'' and ''[[Salamander (video game)|Life Force]]''), becoming known as the [[Konami Code]].

The [[NES]] version of ''Gradius'' was released in [[North America]] in December 1986. It is the first NES game to have been released by Konami in the region and unlike the original arcade game, the title was kept unchanged between regions. The NES version was made available in arcades as a [[Nintendo VS. System]] board (under the title of ''VS. Gradius'') and as a [[PlayChoice-10]] cartridge. ''VS. Gradius'' was distributed to arcades by [[Nintendo]].

===MSX===
The MSX version of ''Gradius'' was released on July 25, 1986, in Japan, a few months after the Famicom version. It was also released in Europe under the ''Nemesis'' title. This version changed similar to the Famicom version but adds its slew of exclusive content to make up for the downgrade. A new stage, the bone planet was added between the Inverted Volcano stage and the Antennoid stage, featuring exclusive enemy types. There also four hidden warp zones and the ability to play as the titular ship from ''[[TwinBee (video game)|TwinBee]]'' if the MSX version of that game is played alongside ''Nemesis''.

===PC Engine===
The PC Engine version of ''Gradius'' was released on November 15, 1991, exclusively in Japan. Released on a 2-Megabit HuCard, it had relatively few omissions compared to the NES and MSX versions and added a Desert Planet stage similar to the Bone Planet stage from the MSX version. Because of the lower resolution of the PC Engine compared to the original arcade hardware, the PC Engine features some slight vertical-scrolling.

===Other platforms===
In addition to the [[MSX]], ''Gradius'' was also ported to other [[microcomputer]]s shortly after its release, such as the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Commodore 64]] in [[Europe]] (as ''Nemesis: The Final Challenge''), as well as the [[PC-8800 series|PC-8801]] and [[X1 (computer)|X1]] in [[Japan]]. A port for the [[X68000]] computer was also included in the early models of the computer.

The original ''Gradius'' is also included in collection such as ''Gradius Deluxe Pack'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], and ''Gradius Collection'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. The arcade version was digitally released on the [[PlayStation 4]] in 2015 and [[Nintendo Switch]] in July 2020 as part of the [[Arcade Archives]] series, with the option to play all four regional variants of the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/arcadearchives/switch/title_list.htm |title=ArcadeArchives {{!}} HAMSTER Corporation |website=www.hamster.co.jp |access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/arcadearchives/title_list_aa.htm |title=Arcade Archives {{!}} HAMSTER Corporation |website=www.hamster.co.jp |access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> It is also included in the ''Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection'' released in 2019 by Konami themselves for  [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]],  [[Nintendo Switch]] and Windows.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/20/konami-anniversary-collections-include-castlevania-contra-and-arcade-classics | title=Konami Anniversary Collections Include Castlevania, Contra, and Arcade Classics | date=20 March 2019 }}</ref>
