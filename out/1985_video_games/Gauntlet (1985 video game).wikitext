'''''Gauntlet''''' is a 1985 [[fantasy]]-themed [[hack-and-slash]] [[arcade video game]] developed and released by [[Atari Games]].<ref name=klov/> It is one of the first [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[dungeon crawl]] arcade games.<ref name=gdc2012_video>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1015841/Classic-Game-Postmortem|title=GDC Vault - Classic Game Postmortem: Gauntlet|access-date=November 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=gdc2012_slides>{{cite web|url=http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc2012/slides/Design%20Track/Logg_Ed_Gauntlet_Postmortem.pdf|title=Gauntlet Postmortem by Ed Logg|access-date=October 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001172252/http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc2012/slides/Design%20Track/Logg_Ed_Gauntlet_Postmortem.pdf|archive-date=October 1, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The core design of ''Gauntlet'' comes from 1983 game ''[[Dandy (video game)|Dandy]]'' for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], which resulted in a threat of legal action.<ref name="Palevich"/> It also has similarities to the [[action-adventure]] [[maze video game]] ''[[Time Bandit]]'' (1983).

The arcade version of ''Gauntlet'' was released in November 1985 and was initially available only as a dedicated four-player [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC Gauntlet.png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]

The game is set within a series of top-down, third-person, orthographic mazes where the object is to kill monsters, gather treasures, and find and touch the designated exit in every level. An assortment of special items can be located in each level that increase the player's character's health, unlock doors, gain more points, and give magical potions that can destroy all of the enemies on screen.<ref name="moby">{{MobyGames|id=/gauntlet|name=''Gauntlet''}}</ref>

Each player controls one of four playable fantasy-based characters: Thor, a [[Barbarian|warrior]]; Merlin, a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]; Thyra, a [[valkyrie]]; or Questor, an [[Elf]]. The characters are named on the cabinet artwork, but in-game they are referred only by the title of their classes. Each character has his or her own unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, the warrior is strongest in hand-to-hand combat, the wizard has the most powerful magic, the valkyrie has the best armor, and the Elf is the fastest in movement.<ref name=ahistory>{{cite web | url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=gauntlet&page=detail&id=938 | title=Gauntlet The Arcade Video Game by Atari Games Corp. | publisher=Arcade History}}</ref> The characters are assigned by control panel in the four-player version, whereas in the two-player version each player selects their own character at the start of the game or while joining during the middle of play.

The enemies are an assortment of fantasy-based monsters, including ghosts, grunts, demons, lobbers, sorcerers, and [[Thief (character class)|thieves]]. Each enters the level through specific generators, which can be destroyed. While there are no [[boss (video games)|bosses]] in the game, the most dangerous enemy is [[Death (personification)|Death]], who can only be destroyed by using a magic potion—otherwise Death will vanish automatically after it has drained a certain amount of health from the player.<ref name="moby"/>

As the game progresses, higher levels of skill are needed to reach the exit, with success often depending on the willingness of the players to cooperate by sharing food and luring monsters into places where they can be engaged and slaughtered more conveniently.<ref name="moby"/> While contact with enemies reduces the player's health, health also slowly drains on its own, thus creating a time limit. When a character's health reaches zero, that character dies. The character can be revived in place with full health by spending a game credit—inserting a coin in the arcade—within a certain short time window after it died. This allows even the least proficient players to keep playing indefinitely, if they are willing to keep inserting coins. However, each player's final score will be divided by the amount of credits they used to play, resulting in an average.

Aside from the ability to have up to four players at once, the game is also noted for the narrator's voice, which is produced by a [[Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips|Texas Instruments TMS5220C speech chip]].<ref name=gdc2012_slides/><ref name="moby"/> The TMS5220C speech was encoded by Earl Vickers.<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> The narrator (voiced by [[Ernie Fosselius]])<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> frequently makes statements repeating the game's rules, including: "Shots do not hurt other players, yet", "Remember, don't shoot food", "Elf shot the food", and "Warrior needs food, badly". The narrator occasionally comments on the battle by saying, "I've not seen such bravery" or "Let's see you get out of here". When a player's life force points fall below 200, the narrator states, "Your life force is running out", "Elf needs food", or "Valkyrie is about to die".

The control panel for the four-player cabinet is wider than other standard uprights in order to accommodate four people at the same time. Each player has an eight-way [[joystick]] and two buttons: one for "fire" (ranged attack) and one for "magic". The "magic" button also starts the game. After ''Gauntlet''{{'}}s release, other games started using this design, so it was a popular conversion target for newer games after it had its run.

==Development==
Originally called ''Dungeons'',<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> the game was conceived by Atari game designer Ed Logg.  He claimed inspiration from his son's interest in the paper-based game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and from his own interest in the 1984 four-player dungeon crawl for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]],  ''[[Dandy (video game)|Dandy]]''.

The game's development spanned from 1983 to 1985, with a team being led by designers Ed Logg and Roger Zeigler.  The working title became legally unavailable in April 1985,<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> so it was renamed ''Gauntlet'' in May.  Based upon some of the most elaborate hardware design in Atari's history to date, it is the company's first coin-operated game that features a voice synthesizer chip.<ref name="Making of Gauntlet, G4TV">{{cite web|last=Scimeca|first=Dennis|date=March 8, 2012|title=The Making Of Gauntlet -- A Classic Arcade Game That Atari Never Saw Coming|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/721573/the-making-of-gauntlet-a-classic-arcade-game-that-atari-never-saw-coming/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210117/http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/721573/the-making-of-gauntlet-a-classic-arcade-game-that-atari-never-saw-coming/|archive-date=March 3, 2016|access-date=November 2, 2014|publisher=[[G4TV]]}}</ref>

Another game which ''Gauntlet'' bears a striking resemblance to is ''[[Time Bandit]]'' (1983), especially its [[Atari ST]] version released in 1985, which led to claims of one possibly being a "clone" of the other. However, ''Time Bandit'' designer Harry Lafnear stated that his game was based on [[Konami]]'s earlier arcade game ''[[Tutankham]]'' (1982), and that he only found out about ''Gauntlet'' after the Atari ST version was completed in late 1985. He believes neither game copied each other, but that their similarities stem from being inspired by earlier "[[Maze game|maze]] [[shoot 'em up]]" titles such as ''Tutankham''.<ref name="legend">{{cite web |title=Harry Lafnear Interview |url=https://www.atarilegend.com/interviews/interviews_detail.php?selected_interview_id=4 |website=Atari Legend |date=September 5, 2003}}</ref> In 2008, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' magazine called ''Tutankham'' "an early ''Gauntlet''".<ref>{{cite magazine|date=August 2008|title=Developer Lookback: Konami Part I|url=https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_053#page/n27/mode/2up|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=53|page=29}}</ref>

===''Dandy'' dispute===
[[Ed Logg]], the co-creator of ''[[Asteroids (arcade game)|Asteroids]]'' and ''[[Centipede (arcade game)|Centipede]]'', is credited with the original game design of ''Gauntlet'' in the arcade version, as well as the 1987 NES release. After its release, John Palevich threatened a lawsuit, asserting that the original concept for the game was from ''Dandy'', a game for the Atari 8-bit home computers written by Palevich and published in 1983. The conflict was settled without any suit being filed, with [[Atari Games]] doing business as [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] allegedly awarding Palevich a ''Gauntlet'' game machine.<ref name="Palevich">{{Citation|publisher=ATARI PROTOS.com| title=Dark Chambers |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/7800/software/darkchambers/darkchambers.htm |access-date=September 11, 2007}}</ref> While he is credited with "special thanks" through 1986, Logg is entirely removed from credits on later releases<ref name="credits">{{Citation|publisher=Moby Games| title=Gauntlet Credits|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/gauntlet/credits|access-date=September 11, 2007}}</ref> and as of 2007 Logg claims no involvement with the NES game.<ref name="interview">{{cite web |publisher=Atari HQ|title=Tetris Forever|author=tsr|url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/special/el/el.html | access-date=September 11, 2007}}</ref> ''Dandy'' was later reworked by Atari Corporation and published for the [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 7800]], and Atari 8-bit computers as ''[[Dandy (video game)|Dark Chambers]]'' in 1988.<ref name="amy">{{cite web |last=Vendel |first=Curt |title=The Atari 65XEM (AMY Sound Processor) |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8bits/xe/xe_protos/65xem.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110913013745/http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8bits/xe/xe_protos/65xem.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 13, 2011 |access-date=June 5, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

''Gauntlet'' was ported to [[MS-DOS]], [[Apple II]], [[Mac (computer)|Mac]], [[MSX]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Apple IIGS]], [[Master System]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation 1]] console as part of [[Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2|Midway's Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2]]. An [[X68000]] version was under development by [[M2 (game developer)|M2]], before being showcased to [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] and released as ''[[Gauntlet IV]]'' for [[Sega Genesis]].<ref name="M2Gauntlet">{{cite web|url=https://www.mtwo.co.jp/en/corp-profile/|title=Corporate Profile|date=December 20, 2013 |publisher=[[M2 (game developer)|M2]]|access-date=2019-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921215431/https://www.mtwo.co.jp/en/corp-profile/|archive-date=2019-09-21|url-status=live}}</ref>

The NES version was developed and published by [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]], Atari Games' consumer software publishing division, and was released in 1988, was the very first title to be developed in the United States for the NES.<ref name="nadate">{{cite web |url=https://retrocdn.net/File:ComputerEntertainer_US_Vol.7_05.pdf |title=Volume 7, Issue 5 |date=August 2017 |work=[[Computer Entertainer]] |access-date=2017-03-26}}</ref>

===Expansion pack===
''Gauntlet: The Deeper Dungeons'' is an [[expansion pack]] for the original computer ports of ''Gauntlet'' with 512 new levels. It was released in 1987 by the British company [[U.S. Gold]] in the UK and Europe, and [[Mindscape (software publisher)|Mindscape]] in the United States for the Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum ports of ''Gauntlet''.<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/gauntlet-the-deeper-dungeons|name=''Gauntlet: The Deeper Dungeons''}}</ref> It was developed by [[Gremlin Interactive|Gremlin Graphics]].

Many of its levels were entries in a competition throughout Europe in which ten winners were awarded prizes, a ''Gauntlet'' T-shirt and a copy of the program for their computers.<ref>''Gauntlet: The Deeper Dungeons'' instructions.</ref> The contest was announced in the instructions of many of the ported games.<ref>Original Gauntlet cassette tape version instructions released by U.S. Gold.</ref> The levels are presented randomly and its artwork is the side panel artwork of the arcade cabinet with only the main characters shown. The enemies were removed from the image and replaced with a pink background.

Reviewers noted that the levels were much harder than those in the original game, although the consensus was that it was not quite as good as the first game or the newly released arcade sequel.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Deeper Dungeons review | first=Sara | last=Biggs | journal=Your Sinclair | issue=18 | date=June 1987 | page=58 | url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-18/YourSinclair_18_Jun_1987#page/n59/mode/1up | access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="sudedurv">{{ cite magazine | title=The Deeper Dungeons review | magazine=Sinclair User | issue=63 | date=June 1987 | page=49 | url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-063/SinclairUser_063_Jun_1987#page/n48/mode/1up | access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=The Deeper Dungeons review | journal=ZX Computing | date=June 1986 |page=35 | url=https://archive.org/stream/zxcomputing-magazine-1987-06/ZXComputing_1987_06#page/n34/mode/1up | access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{ cite journal | title=The Deeper Dungeons review | journal=Computer Gamer | date=June 1987 | issue=27 | page=73 | url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gamer_Issue_27_1987-06_Argus_Press_GB#page/n72/mode/1up | access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref>
