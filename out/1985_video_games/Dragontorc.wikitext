To reactivate it and achieve her evil ambitions, Morag needs to gather the five crowns of the kingdoms of Britain. She has manipulated the [[Saxons]] to fight against the kings so she can steal the five crowns, and has already caused the death of King [[Vortigern]] and seized the crown of [[Dumnonia]]. To save the realm, Maroc sets out to seek out and destroy the remaining crowns, infiltrate the citadel of Morag to find and kill her, and free the [[Merlin|Merlyn]], his mentor who has been enchanted by Morag.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/computer-and-videogames-042|title=Computer and Videogames Magazine Issue 042|date=1 April 1985|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_04_1985-07_Argus_Press_GB|title=Computer Gamer - Issue 04 (1985-07)(Argus Press)(GB)|date=1 July 1985|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Crash_No._22_1985-11_Newsfield_GB|title=Crash - No. 22 (1985-11)(Newsfield)(GB)|date=1 November 1985|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
