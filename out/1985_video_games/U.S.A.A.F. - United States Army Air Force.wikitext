According to M. Evan Brooks of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', ''U.S.A.A.F.'' sold poorly. He remarked in 1993, "Based upon its commercial success, it would appear that its fans are limited to this reviewer and the designer."<ref name=brookssurvey>{{cite magazine | title=Brooks' Book Of Wargames: 1900-1950, R-Z | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=111 |date=October 1993| author=Brooks, M.

Jay Selover reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "it covers well what it sets out to do. As a study of the collapse of Germany's industrial capacity under the weight of American bombs, it is unsurpassed."<ref name="CGW27">{{cite magazine |last=Selover |first=Jay |title=Side by Side: Europe Ablaze and USAAF |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1986 |volume=1 |issue=27 |pages=16–18}}</ref>

In a 1988 ''[[Page 6]]'' survey of wargames for Atari computers, writer M. Evan Brooks called ''U.S.A.A.F.'' "highly recommended" and "a fascinating product".<ref name=page6>{{cite journal | author=Brooks, M. Evan | title=Wargames | journal=[[Page 6]] | issue=31 | date=January–February 1988 | pages=12–16 }}</ref> In a similar 1989 survey, J. L. Miller of ''Computer Play'' called the game "interesting and a real learning tool" and dubbed it a "recommended" title.<ref name=computerplay /> In his 1993 survey, Brooks continued his praise for ''U.S.A.A.F.'' and upgraded it to a five-star score.<ref name=brookssurvey />
