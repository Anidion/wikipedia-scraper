'''''Doctor Who and the Mines of Terror''''' is a game for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[BBC Micro]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/1549/Doctor-Who-And-The-Mines-Of-Terror/|title=Doctor Who And The Mines Of Terror|work=computinghistory.org.uk}}</ref> and [[Commodore 64]]. It was first released by [[Micro Power]] on the BBC Micro in 1985,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cuttingsarchive.org/index.php/Dr_Who_on_the_CBM_64|title = Dr Who on the CBM 64 - the Doctor Who Cuttings Archive}}</ref> and on the Amstrad CPC & C64<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/c64/568759-doctor-who-and-the-mines-of-terror|title=Doctor Who and the Mines of Terror|work=gamefaqs.com}}</ref> in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/games/doctor-who-and-the-mines-of-terror/|title=C64|work=GameSpot}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

The game's play centres on the player's character of the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] (specifically his [[Sixth Doctor|sixth incarnation]]), and his robotic programmable cat Splinx.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebase64.com/oldsite/gameofweek/13/gotw_doctorwhomines.htm|title=gamebase64.com - The Gamebase Collection|work=gamebase64.com}}</ref> The goal of the game is to halt the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]]'s production of Heatonite, retrieve stolen plans for the [[Time Lord]]s, and return safely.

The game's screen always has the player in the centre, and depending on the direction of movement, the entire screen scrolls horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player can move freely, but can die in many ways: monster attack, robot attack, too great a fall, forced regeneration, lack of oxygen, and sharp spikes.

Enemies include patrolling robots that resemble the [[Daleks]]; however, the actual name and exact design of the Daleks was not used due to the rights to them being part owned by [[Terry Nation]], creator of the Daleks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Saavedra |first1=John |title=A Timey Wimey History of Doctor Who Games |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/games/a-timey-wimey-history-of-doctor-who-games/ |website=[[Den of Geek]] |date=8 November 2014}}</ref>

==Development and release==
The game began life as a sequel to the hit BBC Micro game ''[[Castle Quest (1985 video game)|Castle Quest]]'', and was adapted into a ''Doctor Who'' game mid-development.

As it was too large to fit into the standard memory of the BBC Micro, it came with its own [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chip which had to be installed for the game to run in conjunction with game's main disk.

==Reception== 
Zzap!64's reviewers noted the game's similarity to ''Castle Quest''.  They found that despite average graphics and weak sound, it was an enjoyable release thanks to the entertaining gameplay.  It was rated 86% overall.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=13&page=26|title= Doctor Who and the Mines of Terror|page=26| issue=13|date= May 1986|journal=[[Zzap!64]]|via=zzap64.co.uk}}</ref>

[[Aktueller Software Markt|ASM]] gave the game 4 out of 10, saying the game was trite.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Tolle Aufmachung — aber: reicht das? |journal=Aktueller Software Markt |date=June 1986 |trans-title=Great presentation — but: is that enough?|language=de|url=https://archive.org/details/asm_magazine-1986-06/page/n15/mode/2up?q=Doctor+Who|page=6}}</ref>
