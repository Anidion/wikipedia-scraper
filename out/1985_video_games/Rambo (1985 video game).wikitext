'''''Rambo''''' (stylized on-screen as '''''Rambo: First Blood Part II''''') is a 1985 video game based on the film ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985). The game was designed by David Collier and Tony Pomfret with the ZX Spectrum version converted by Platinum Productions.<ref name="YS21">{{cite magazine |title=Rambo|author=Peter Shaw|magazine=Your Spectrum |issue=21 |publisher=Sportscene Specialist Press |date=December 1985|pages=56–57|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=336&page=56}}</ref>

The Commodore 64 version's music is by [[Martin Galway]] from Northern Ireland, incorporating melodies from the film's score. The Amstrad CPC version's music was played and recorded live by Choice Software's in-house programmer/designer/musician James Edward Cosby also from Northern Ireland, using a [[Yamaha DX7]] synthesiser via the then new [[MIDI]] serial comms protocol.

Several other games based on the film were also released, including ''[[Rambo (Nintendo Entertainment System game)|Rambo]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II (Master System video game)|Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' for the [[Master System]].

The game follows the movie's story. The player, who is controlling Rambo, has to find his lost equipment, locate the POW camp, rescue the hostages, and make it back to the extraction point while being pursued by constantly respawning enemies. Rambo starts off with just a Bowie knife and grenades (both of which have an unlimited supply, as with all the weapons), and gains points for killing the enemy, and for collecting the following equipment: Rocket Launcher, M16 Rifle, and Bow & Arrows (Explosive & Non Explosive).

The gameplay is based on [[Capcom]]'s arcade game ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'' (1985).<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Going Platinum|magazine=Crash |issue=32 |publisher=Newsfield |date=October 1985|pages=124–126|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=988&page=124}}</ref>

''Rambo'' was well received. Your Sinclair described it as "a thinking man's ''Commando''. That game starts fast and gets faster until you end up like a one-man whirlwind. Rambo develops into a solid shoot'em up".

''Rambo'' replaced ''Commando'' as the number one game in the Gallup ZX Spectrum chart<ref name='pcw9jan86charts'>{{cite magazine |title=Charts|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=2|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=9 January 1986|page=35|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2890&page=35|access-date=9 March 2023}}</ref> and did the same on the Commodore 64 and All Formats charts the following week.<ref name='pcw16jan86charts'>{{cite magazine |title=Charts|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=3|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=16 January 1986|page=35|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2891&page=35|access-date=9 March 2023}}</ref> The Amstrad CPC version also went to number one eight weeks later, replacing ''[[Yie Ar Kung Fu]]''.<ref name='pcw13mar86charts'>{{cite magazine |title=Charts|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=11|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=13 March 1986|page=35|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2899&page=35|access-date=9 March 2023}}</ref>
