The player controls one of the four Nurds and must complete 50 rooms filled with obstacles, collecting food along the way. Each level has different obstacles (such as snakes, bugs, or bouncing balls) that must be avoided, or the player will lose one of three lives. The player-controlled Nurd can fly using the propellers on its head, but if the Nurd touches a wall or platform, it floats back to the ground and cannot fly until it touches solid land. In each room, the player must collect four pieces of food before he can proceed to the next level.

==Reception==
''Whirlinurd'' received mixed reviews, many of which highlighted the game's derivativeness. ''[[Your Commodore]]'' reviewer concluded: "I found this game quite challenging to play, but I can't say that it was more exciting than the host of other games in the same vein."<ref name="yc"/> A ''[[Commodore User]]'' reviewer agreed: "Whirlinurd is pretty standard stuff really and very similar in concept, though not detail, to umpteen other obstacle games".<ref name="cu"/>
