{{nihongo foot|'''''Tehkan World Cup''''',|テーカン ワールド カップ|Tēkan Wārudo Kappu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} originally released as {{nihongo foot|'''''World Cup'''''|ワールド カップ|Wārudo Kappu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan,<ref name="Beep"/> is an [[List of association football video games|association football video game]] released to [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1985 by [[Tehkan]], the former name of [[Tecmo]]. It features multiplayer gameplay and [[trackball]] controllers.<ref name="KLOV"/> It was released in both upright and table [[arcade cabinet]]s,<ref name="GM278">{{cite magazine |title=Overseas Readers Column: Tecmo (Tehkan) Ship Table Type PCB "World Cup" |date=15 February 1986 |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19860215p.pdf#page=12 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=278 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |page=22 |lang=ja}}</ref> but was most commonly released in a [[cocktail cabinet]] form factor.<ref name="KLOV"/> Its arrival coincided with the buildup to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]. It featured the then colors of several of the world's top teams such as West Germany, Argentina and Brazil, although it did not mention any team by name.<ref name="KLOV"/>

The game uses a [[bird's-eye view]], with the trackball controls allowing [[game physics]] such as controlling both the direction and speed of the shot. The gameplay format was adapted from the [[List of American football video games|American football game]] ''[[Gridiron Fight]]'', developed by the same team and released earlier in the year, for an association football game, but with the controls simplified down to a trackball and single action button. It became a major success in arcades, and was a landmark title for association football games upon release. While ''Tehkan World Cup'' was not officially ported to home systems at the time, its gameplay format was later adapted by [[Sensible Software]] to develop the [[home computer game]] ''[[MicroProse Soccer]]'' (1988) and provided the basis for later association football games such as the ''[[Sensible Soccer]]'' series in the [[1990s in video games|early 1990s]].

In 1990, ''Tehkan World Cup'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] as ''[[Tecmo World Cup Soccer]]''. The original arcade version was also released for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] consoles as '''''Tecmo Cup''''' in [[2000s in video games|the 2000s]].

== Gameplay ==
Graphically, it offered a [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[bird's-eye view]] of the field that was unique for its time.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10057|title=Tehkan World Cup - Videogame by Tehkan|website=[[Killer List of Videogames]]|access-date=11 May 2021}}</ref><ref name="Retro"/> It has multi-directional [[scrolling]], with only a portion of the field visible on screen at any time.<ref name="CG12"/>

Its [[trackball]] control system contributed significantly to its gameplay which was relatively speedy and exhibited a fluidity something akin to [[ice hockey]], with as little as 3 seconds required to score from kick-off. Two-player action could be highly competitive, with players facing each other across the game space while using sweeping arm movements reminiscent of [[table tennis]].<ref name="KLOV"/>

There was a single fire button along with the trackball. The [[game physics]] allowed the trackball to control both the direction and the [[velocity]] of the shot.<ref name="Retro"/> There is also a [[mini-map]], displaying the positions of all the players.<ref name="CG12"/>

== Development ==
''Tehkan World Cup'' was developed by [[Tehkan]], the former name of Tecmo. It was developed shortly after the [[List of American football video games|American football game]] ''[[Gridiron Fight]]'', released earlier the same year, with several of the same team members working on ''Tehkan World Cup''.<ref name="GameSide">{{cite journal |title=Interview with a Wonder Boy - Michihito Ishizuka |journal=[[:ja:GAME SIDE|Game Side: Ultimate Game Life Magazine]] |date=December 2007 |volume=9 |publisher=[[:ja:マイクロマガジン社|Micro Magazine]] |language=ja}}</ref><ref name="Gamest">{{cite magazine |title=Talking Game Design with Fukio "MTJ" Mitsuji |magazine=[[Gamest]] |date=1989 |lang=ja |url=http://shmuplations.com/mtjdesign/}}</ref> The game was planned and designed by [[Shin-ichiro Tomie]]<ref name="MAME">{{cite web |title=Tehkan World Cup (set 1) |url=http://maws.mameworld.info/minimaws/set/tehkanwc |website=Mini MAWS |publisher=[[MAME]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007113259/http://maws.mameworld.info/minimaws/set/tehkanwc |archive-date=2011-10-07 |access-date=12 May 2021}}</ref> with Kazutoshi Ueda (who previously worked on titles such as ''[[Space Panic]]'', ''[[Lady Bug (video game)|Lady Bug]]'', ''[[Mr. Do!]]'' and ''[[Bomb Jack]]'').<ref name="Gamest"/> It was programmed by Michishito Ishizuka,<ref name="Gamest"/><ref name="GameSide"/> while character design and background graphics were handled by his wife Rie Ishizuka (also known as Rie Yatomi),<ref name="GameSide"/><ref name="MAME"/> cabinet design by Kohji Okada, and illustrations by Hideyuki Yokoyama.<ref name="MAME"/>

Tomie, who had previously designed ''Gridiron Fight'', was a big soccer fan, so he wanted to adapt the gameplay format of ''Gridiron Fight'' for a soccer game. ''Gridiron Fight'' used similar trackball controls, but was more complex. The team decided to simplify the controls, so that the player can run with the trackball and press one button to kick.<ref name="Gamest"/>

== Reception ==
The game was a major arcade hit.<ref name="Gamest"/> In Japan, ''World Cup'' was listed by ''[[:ja:Beep!|Beep]]'' magazine as the seventh top-grossing arcade game of November 1985.<ref name="Beep">{{cite magazine |title=ビデオゲームランキング (1985年11月) |trans-title=Video Game Rankings (November 1985) |magazine=[[:ja:Beep!|Beep!]] |date=1 February 1986 |issue=1986–02 |publisher=[[SoftBank Group]] |location=Japan |page=93 |lang=ja |url=https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/M/MULTi88/20190403/20190403191411.jpg}}</ref> ''[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]'' magazine later listed ''World Cup'' on their February 15, 1986 issue as being the third most successful [[table arcade cabinet]] of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=278|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 February 1986|page=21|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19860215p.pdf#page=11|lang=ja}}</ref> It went on to be Japan's fourth highest-grossing table arcade game for two years in a row, [[1986 in video games|in 1986]]<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '86 上半期 |trans-title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: First Half '86 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=288 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=15 July 1986 |page=28 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19860715p.pdf#page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '86 下半期 |trans-title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: Second Half '86 |magazine=Game Machine |issue=300 |publisher=Amusement Press, Inc. |date=15 January 1987 |page=16 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19870115p.pdf#page=9}}</ref> and [[1987 in video games|1987]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '87 |magazine=Game Machine |issue=324 |publisher=Amusement Press, Inc. |date=15 January 1988 |page=20 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19880115p.pdf#page=11}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
Tecmo released an arcade successor to the game, ''[[Tecmo World Cup '90]]'', in 1989.

Shinichiro Tomie, who was a big soccer fan, went on to develop Tecmo's ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'' series of association football games, based on the popular sports [[manga]] and [[anime]] series.<ref name="Famitsu">{{cite magazine |title=『街』への想いから昨今のインディーゲームまで――チュンソフト30周年のすべてを中村光一氏と振り返るロングインタビュー【後編】 |trans-title=From feelings for "Town" to recent indie games―A long interview with Mr. Koichi Nakamura looking back on all of Chunsoft's 30th anniversary (Part 2) |url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201406/09054675.html |access-date=12 May 2021 |magazine=[[Famitsu]] |date=2014-06-09}} |lang=ja}</ref> The first title in the series, the [[Nintendo Famicom]] game ''Captain Tsubasa'' (1988), was released as ''[[Tecmo Cup Soccer Game]]'' in North America and ''Tecmo Cup Football Game'' in Europe. Tecmo later went on to develop ''[[Tecmo Cup Football Game]]'' (1993) with [[Sega]] for the [[Mega Drive]] console, before the game was cancelled.

Tomie, who later became the scenario writer for [[Chunsoft]]'s ''Shiren the Wander'' series of ''[[Mystery Dungeon]]'' [[role-playing video games]], returned to the association football game genre with the [[Game Boy Advance]] spin-off ''[[List of Mystery Dungeon video games|Shiren Monsters: Netsal]]'' (2004), a soccer game.<ref name="Famitsu"/>

''Tehkan World Cup'' was released in 2004 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and in 2005 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], in both cases under the name ''Tecmo Cup''.

''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' ranked ''Tehkan World Cup'' the fourteenth best football game of all time.<ref name="Stuff">{{cite web |last1=Grannell |first1=Craig |title=The 25 best football games ever |url=https://www.stuff.tv/features/25-best-football-games-ever |access-date=13 May 2021 |work=[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]] |date=29 May 2018}}</ref>

=== Impact ===
''Tehkan World Cup'' was a landmark title for association football games upon release.<ref name="IGN">{{cite news |last1=Robertson |first1=John |title=IGN's History of Football Games |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/01/igns-history-of-football-games |access-date=12 May 2021 |work=[[IGN]] |date=1 July 2014}}</ref> It was considered "revolutionary" for its trackball control system, as well as its top-down perspective that allows players to see more of the pitch,<ref name="IGN"/> and its physics where players control the direction and speed of the shot with the trackball.<ref name="Retro"/><ref name="RG33"/> Its use of a top-down overhead perspective was predated by [[Alpha Denshi]]'s ''[[Exciting Soccer]]'' (1983), but ''Tehkan World Cup'' was responsible for popularizing the format.<ref name="Stuff"/>

Game designer [[Jon Hare]] cited ''Tehkan World Cup'' as the biggest influence on the football games developed by him and Chris Yates at [[Sensible Software]]. It was the basis and the inspiration for the [[home computer game]] ''[[MicroProse Soccer]]'' (1988).<ref name="Retro">{{cite magazine |title=The Sensible Game: Jon Hare Reveals the Drive and Inspiration – Direct and Indirect – For the Beautiful Game That Became Sensible Soccer |magazine=[[GamesTM|Retro: The Ultimate Retro Companion from Games<sup>TM</sup>]] |date=2010 |volume=3 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=224-231 (228-9) |url=https://issuu.com/topov81/docs/retro_volume_3/228}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=In the chair with...
