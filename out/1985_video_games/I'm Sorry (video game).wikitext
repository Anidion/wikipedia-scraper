'''''I'm Sorry''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Gombe's I'm Sorry'''''|ごんべえのあいむそ〜り〜|Gonbē no Aimusōrī}}, is a [[political satire]] [[arcade game]] developed by [[Banpresto|Coreland]] and published by [[Sega]] in 1985. This [[action game]] stars a [[caricature]] of former [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Kakuei Tanaka]]. The title is actually a play on the Japanese word for Prime Minister, ''Sōri'' (総理).<ref name=avclub /> ''I'm Sorry'' was made after the [[Lockheed bribery scandals]], and satirizes Tanaka's greed by making the goal of the game acquiring gold bars.<ref name=avclub /> Despite the game's context in Japanese politics, ''I'm Sorry'' was localized to [[United States]] arcades.

==Gameplay==
The goal is for the greedy [[protagonist]] to collect all the [[gold bar]]s while jumping over or defeating various enemies and obstacles in each maze-like level. Some of these enemies are: [[Giant Baba]] (a Japanese wrestler), a moonwalking [[Michael Jackson]], [[Madonna]], Japanese comedian [[Tamori]], [[Carl Lewis]], moving statues (activated when passed by).<ref name=avclub>{{cite news |last1=Teti |first1=John |last2=Agnello |first2=Anthony John |last3=Gerardi |first3=Matt |last4=Kaiser |first4=Joe |date=18 June 2014 |title=Ninja-demon Batman: 8 character ripoffs in '80s Japanese games |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/ninja-demon-batman-8-character-ripoffs-80s-japanes-205830 |newspaper=[[The A.V.

When the player collects all the gold in a given level, they must cash it into a building (labeled "out" when the level begins and "in" once all the gold is retrieved) to beat the level. The player can only hold ten bars of gold at once. In later levels there are more than 10 bars of gold, so the player must make multiple deposits.

==Levels==
The game has 4 maps. After every 4 levels the game returns to first map. However, the difficulty of the map is increased by adding one of the following:
* More enemies
* More difficult enemies
* Conveyor belts
* Gates
* Disappearing platforms
* More gold
* Safes
There are 32 distinct levels. Once level 32 is completed, the player returns to level 16.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''I'm Sorry'' on their May 15, 1985 issue as being the  most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=260|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 May 1985|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>
