==Reception==
In ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', the game was reviewed by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' creator [[Dave Arneson]], who wrote that it is "a great historical simulation and will keep players at their keyboards for many a night in order to win their empires. It has economics, intrigue, bribery, covert action, diplomacy, war, and more! There are many ways beyond simple conquest to accomplish one's goals." He concluded: "I most heartily recommend ''Romance'' to all serious game players out there."<ref name="CGW51">{{Cite magazine|author=Dave Arneson|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=51 | date=September 1988|issue=51|pages=12â€“13, 31, 34|title=Romance of the Three Kingdoms|author-link=Dave Arneson}}</ref>
