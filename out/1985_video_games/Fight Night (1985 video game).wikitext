==Reception==
Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The game could have been much better. The graphics are good and it is possible to create your own characters and save them to disk for future use. My only question is why would you want to?"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Teverbaugh |first=Rick |title=Sports Scorecard |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1986 |volume=1 |issue=27 |page=41}}</ref>

''Fight Night'' was Accolade's third best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-12-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_54_1987_Dec#page/n17/mode/2up | title=The Commodore Games That Live On And On | work=Compute's Gazette | date=December 1987 | access-date=24 January 2015 | author=Ferrell, Keith | pages=18–22}}</ref>

''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' described the Atari 8-bit version as "entertaining, frustrating and not just a bit silly (which is one of its strengths)". The magazine concluded that "''Fight Night'''s primary function is to involve you and make you laugh, not to precisely mimic the action in a boxing ring. It de-brutalizes the sport, which is a point in its favor".<ref name="pearlman198704">{{Cite magazine |last=Pearlman |first=Gregg |date=April 1987 |title=Fight Night |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v5n12/ProductReviews.html |magazine=Antic}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' rated the 7800 version 80% in 1989.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Complete Games Guide |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref>
