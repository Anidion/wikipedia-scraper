'''''Highway Encounter''''' is a video game published for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Sharp MZ]], and [[Tatung Einstein]] by [[Vortex Software]] in 1985. It was written by [[Costa Panayi]] who also coded ''[[Android One: The Reactor Run|Android]]'', ''[[Android Two]]'', ''[[Tornado Low Level|TLL]]'', ''[[Cyclone (computer game)|Cyclone]]'', and ''[[Revolution (video game)|Revolution]]''.

==Summary==
''Highway Encounter'' is a strategy/action game played from a 3D [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which you must successfully chaperone a bomb along a long, straight stretch of highway and into the alien base at the end of it.<ref name=crash>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/20/encounter.htm|title = CRASH 20 - Highway Encounter}}</ref> There are thirty screens to pass through and most are filled with hazards that threaten to block your progress (such as barrels) or destroy you (aliens and explosive mines).

Players control a robotic "Vorton" (resembling a [[dalek]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]'')<ref name=crash/> and one of the features that provides ''Highway Encounter'' with its unique appeal is that the bomb is constantly being pushed onwards by your extra lives - four more Vortons, who accompany you along the highway. A key strategic element to the game is for the player character to travel several screens ahead of the bomb to clear a safe path for it; normally this would be done by temporarily blocking the bomb's forward motion. However, if the bomb is left in an unsafe location, it is possible for all your extra lives to be lost without the player character being destroyed once. Once all spare lives are lost, the player character must manually push the bomb.
