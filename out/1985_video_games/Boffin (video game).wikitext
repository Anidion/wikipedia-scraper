'''''Boffin''''' is a [[platform game]] published in 1985 by [[Addictive Games]] for the [[Acorn Electron]] and [[BBC Micro]]. It was written by 17-year-old Paul Julian O'Malley, who at the time was a resident of [[Romsey]], Hampshire, UK.

Initially released for the BBC Micro in 1984,<ref name="Boffin entry on everygamegoing.com">{{cite web| title = Boffin entry on everygamegoing.com | url = http://www.everygamegoing.com/litem/Boffin-1/41636/ | website = everygamegoing.com| access-date = 22 August 2022}}</ref> it was subsequently re-released in 1985<ref name="everygamegoing.com">{{cite web| title = Boffin (version 2) entry on everygamegoing.com | url = http://www.everygamegoing.com/litem/Boffin-1/205/ | website = everygamegoing.com| access-date = 22 August 2022}}</ref> with one side of the tape now featuring its sequel Boffin 2, which ran on both the BBC Micro and the Electron.

==Gameplay==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

The aim of Professor Boffin is to pass through a series of [[caverns]] as quickly as possible by destroying all of the unlucky horseshoes in each cavern and then touching the resident owl, guardian of each cave.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Electron Games Reviews |url=http://8bs.com/elecgame/boffin.htm |access-date=2023-08-28 |website=8bs.com}}</ref>

The Boffin can only jump short distances, but he can fall from any height by opening his [[umbrella]] to slow his descent to a safe speed. Each level ends when the player touches an [[owl]] which is usually located at the bottom of the screen. The 'lucky' owl can only be touched without resulting in death if all of the 'unlucky' upside-down [[Horseshoes (game)|horseshoes]] have been destroyed.

The umbrella mechanic was unique at the time, and means that many levels progress from the top of the screen to the bottom, which was unusual as most platformers since ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' required the player to travel from bottom to top. Also the use of Mode 5 graphics on the second version of the game meant that the graphics were much larger and more colourful than many contemporary games (although the trade-off was that it was very blocky).

The game features giant menacing [[tarantulas]] which cannot be killed, and only advance across the screen in one direction (right to left). They remain motionless until the Boffin is in their line of sight, then rapidly run forwards.

==Release==
The game was first released for the BBC Micro in October 1984 on one [[Compact Cassette|cassette]].<ref name="Boffin entry on everygamegoing.com"/> In July 1985<ref name="everygamegoing.com"/> it received an upgraded second release, with the cassette now containing two different versions of the game. The first version on the tape (confusingly referred to as 'version 2' and sometimes known as ''Boffin 2'') features twenty five caverns and is playable on both the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. The second version on the tape ('version 1', the game of the original release) is still only playable on the BBC Micro only, featuring twenty different caverns. 'Version 2' is in the very blocky graphical Mode 5 (possibly Mode 2), the different memory requirements allowing it to run on both the BBC Micro and Electron, whilst 'version 1' is in the much more defined (but less colourful). The graphics and puzzles differ considerably between the two versions, although the underlying theme is identical.

==Reception==
Jon Revis of ''[[Electron User]]'' praised the tarantula: "He is drawn in superb detail and the characteristic jerky movement of such arachnids - not a programming defect - is impeccable". Although at the time the magazine did not award scores, the review concludes that despite there being many similar games on the market, "...Boffin has sufficient originality to succeed against all the competition".<ref>[http://www.retroalphabet.com/game.asp?Game_Name=BOFFIN ''Boffin'' review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715175013/http://www.retroalphabet.com/game.asp?Game_Name=BOFFIN |date=July 15, 2011 }}, Electron User, Vol. 3, No. 2, December 1985</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Superior Software]] later released a similar game ''[[Elixir (computer game)|Elixir]]'', in which a scientist is shrunk to miniature size and must navigate around his laboratory to collect items to restore his size.
