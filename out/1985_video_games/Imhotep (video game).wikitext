'''''Imhotep''''' is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] for the [[Commodore 64]] published in the United Kingdom by [[Ultimate Play the Game]] on 15 October 1985. The game is set in [[Ancient Egypt]] and revolves around Imhotep the Wise and his mission to stop the famine plaguing the kingdom by obtaining sacred books. ''Imhotep'' was developed by Spaniard Manuel Caballero over a period of ten months during his [[gap year]].<ref name="interview">{{cite web|title=Interviews - Manuel Caballero, Imhotep Programmer|url=http://www.robsoftcloud.net/Ultimate/interviews/inview03.shtml|publisher=Robotsoftcloud|accessdate=16 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091640/http://www.robsoftcloud.net/Ultimate/interviews/inview03.shtml|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Imhotep is a scrolling shooter similar to ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]''. In the game the title character flies on a mystic bird which uses power bolts to shoot down enemies. The player must also avoid the stones flung by catapults.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_052_1986-02_EMAP_Publishing_GB/Computer__Video_Games_Issue_052_1986-02_EMAP_Publishing_GB#page/n29/mode/2up|title = Computer & Video Games - Issue 052 (1986-02)(EMAP Publishing)(GB)|date = February 1986}}</ref>

==Reception==
The game received overwhelmingly negative reviews upon release, with many critics citing it as the worst game published by Ultimate. John Reed from ''[[Zzap!64]]'' was convinced that it would damage Ultimate's reputation as one of Britain's leading software development houses.<ref name="zzap">{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=John|title=Imhotep review|journal=Zzap!64|date=January 1986|issue=9|page=15|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=009&amp;page=015&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap&amp;check=1|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>

It was well received by ''[[Your Commodore]]'''s  reviewer, who said that it was "an infuriatingly addictive game."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/16-your-commodore-magazine/Your_Commodore_Issue_16_1986_Jan#page/n50/mode/1up|title = Your Commodore Magazine Issue 16|date = January 1986}}</ref>
