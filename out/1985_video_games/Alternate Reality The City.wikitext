==Reception==
[[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] gave ''Alternate Reality: The City'' a mixed review in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''. The graphics were praised for its attention to detail, as was the expansive city to explore. She criticized the game, however, for having no goal; once the city is painfully mapped out, the only thing left to do is monotonously battle enemies in preparation for ''The Dungeon''. The 8-bit versions omitted certain features such as joining guilds, and Scorpia criticized the Apple version's poor graphics.<ref name="CGW">{{citation|date =November 1986|author=Scorpia|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|title=Alternate Reality: The City|pages=22–23}}</ref> In 1993 Scorpia called ''The City'' "a fascinating premise that turned out rather poorly ... a game for those with great persistence and patience".<ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 |title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1993 |access-date=25 March 2016 |author=Scorpia |pages=34–50}}</ref>
