Reviewing the ZX Spectrum version, ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' complimented the games graphics, thinking it a "vast improvement" over Elite Systems' previous release, ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (video game)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', but criticised the lack of [[each-way|each way bets]] and the unintuitive controls.<ref name="CRASH" /> In their column "Joystick Jury" (formatted in the style of ''[[Juke Box Jury]]''), the editors of ''[[Your Spectrum]]'' generally thought the game would be a hit, complementing the graphics and betting mechanics, but with Ross Holman thinking the pace of the action inadequate.<ref name="YS" />
