'''''Shanghai Kid''''', sometimes titled '''''The Shanghai Kid''''' and known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Hokuha Syourin Hiryū no Ken'''''|北派少林 飛龍の拳|lit. "North Faction Shaolin - Fist of the Flying Dragon"}}, is a [[1985 in video gaming|1985]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[fighting game]] developed by Nihon Game (now [[Culture Brain]]) and published by Taiyo System. It is the first game in the ''[[Hiryū no Ken]]'' series by [[Culture Brain]].

==Gameplay==
''Shanghai Kid'' uses an 8-way [[joystick]] and two buttons (one for punching and one for kicking).

Set in a [[tournament]] competition, players can perform power-punches, kicks, and slams, with [[martial arts]], [[wrestling]] and [[kickboxing]] represented in the game. The game also makes use of voice sound effects.<ref>{{cite magazine |title='Shanghai Kid' from Memetron |magazine=RePlay |date=November 1985 |volume=11 |issue=2 |page=190 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-11-issue-no.-2-november-1985-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2011%2C%20Issue%20No.%202%20-%20November%201985/page/190}}</ref>

It contributes to the fighting game genre by introducing the [[Combo (video gaming)|combo system]] and the ability to perform special moves. When the spiked [[speech balloon]] that reads "RUSH!" pops up during battle, the player has a chance to rhythmically perform a series of combos called "rush-attacking", which would later be found in other fighting games such as [[SNK]]'s the ''[[Art of Fighting]]'' and ''[[The King of Fighters]]'' series. The special moves feature, unlike the basic moves one, allows players to perform moves that are more advanced than the basic ones, and by using two buttons simultaneously instead of one.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]'' listed ''Hiryū no Ken'' on their August 15, 1985 issue as being the third most successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=266|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 August 1985|page=21|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19850815p.pdf#page=11|lang=ja}}</ref> In North America, ''Shanghai Kid'' was the sixth top-grossing software kit on the ''RePlay'' arcade charts in November 1985.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=RePlay: The Players' Choice |magazine=RePlay |date=November 1985 |volume=11 |issue=2 |page=6 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-11-issue-no.-2-november-1985-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2011%2C%20Issue%20No.%202%20-%20November%201985%20%28Compressed%29/page/6}}</ref>
