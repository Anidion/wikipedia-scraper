{{nihongo foot|'''''Tiger-Heli'''''|タイガー・ヘリ|''Taigā-Heri''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[vertically scrolling shooter]] game developed by [[Toaplan]] and released for [[arcade game|arcades]] in 1985. It was published in Japan by [[Taito]] and in North America by [[Romstar]]. Controlling the titular attack helicopter, the player must fight endless waves of military vehicles while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The Tiger-Heli has a powerful bomb at its disposal that can clear the screen of enemies when fired. It was the first shoot 'em up game from Toaplan, and their third video game overall.

''Tiger-Heli'' was the creation of video game composers Masahiro Yuge and [[Tatsuya Uemura]], who had previously worked on several titles for Japanese companies Orca and Crux before both of them declared bankruptcy. The development team drew inspiration from the arcade game ''[[Gyrodine]]''. The team wanted to create a scrolling shooter that balanced between being entertaining and fun, and to have players keep wanting to play it after dying. The staff chose a helicopter as the player's craft as they felt it would work for a game that had the screen continuously scrolling. The soundtrack, composed by Uemura, was made to convey a sense of bravery, which was hampered by technical limitations.

''Tiger-Heli'' was well received by critics for its gameplay, graphics and weapons, and helped establish Toaplan as a leading producer of shooting games throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Micronics]], selling over one million copies. A [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was released in 1996 by [[Banpresto]] as part of the compilation ''Toaplan Shooting Battle 1''. It was followed by two sequels: ''[[Twin Cobra]]'' (1987), and ''[[Twin Cobra II]]'' (1995). The rights to ''Tiger-Heli'' are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese developer formed by Yuge. In 2021, the game was released exclusively in Japan for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] as part of the ''Toaplan Arcade Garage'' compilation.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Tiger-Heli.png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]
''Tiger-Heli'' is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game, in which players take control of the titular attack helicopter through four increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like [[tank]]s, [[battleship]]s, and [[artillery]] as the main objective.<ref name="T-HACmanual">''Tiger-Heli'' instruction manual (Arcade, US)</ref><ref name="T-HNESmanual">''Tiger-Heli'' Game Pak Instructions (Nintendo Entertainment System, US)</ref><ref name="T-Hhg101">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|title=Tiger-Heli|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402223234/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Besides some [[airplane]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[helipad]] is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of half the screen's height and two [[bomb]]s.

A unique gameplay feature is the bomb mechanic; unlike other games in the genre released at the time, the bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its [[blast radius]].<ref name="T-HNESmanual"/> The bombs also act as a shield against incoming enemy fire, however, as they can be triggered after taking enemy hits as well. There are also three types of [[Item (gaming)|item]]s scattered through every stage in total that appear as destructible flashing [[cross]]es: extra bomb stocks and two variations of helicopter "options" that attack at the player's will against incoming enemies, while is also possible to mix and match the two helicopter option types, totaling no more than two.<ref name="T-HNESmanual"/><ref name="T-Hhg101"/> These items can be picked up by shooting their respective cross color but grabbing any item when not necessary yields bonus points.<ref name="T-HNESmanual"/><ref name="T-Hhg101"/>

Players are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded by reaching certain score thresholds or collecting ten [[gold]] [[diamond]]s in a row by shooting them.<ref name="T-HNESmanual"/> Firing on determined locations is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as certain [[setpiece]]s in some stages hosts a bonus secret within their scenery.<ref name="T-HNESmanual"/><ref name="T-Hhg101"/> There are also hidden bonus secrets to be found as well. The game employs a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name="T-Hhg101"/> Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a life, as well as the helicopter options and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns.<ref name="T-Hhg101"/>

== Development ==
''Tiger-Heli'' was created under the working title ''Cobra'' by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan and among them were [[Video game composer|composer]]s Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, both of which recounted the project's development process and history between 1989 and 2012 through various Japanese publications.<ref name="PSGv10">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=東亜プランインタビュー|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=F.S.G Club|date=September 1989|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name="G49">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/gamest0049#page/69/mode/2up|title=東亜プラン|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|pages=68–69|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name="TFf25v9">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|date=June 2009|pages=1–70|lang=ja}} ([https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201010170328/https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332|date=2020-10-10}}).</ref> The team wanted to create a game that balanced frustrating and entertaining sections, as well as inciting audiences to keep playing after losing a live and progress further, though the idea of playing as a helicopter was influenced by ''Gyrodine'' because the team felt it could work as a shoot 'em up title where the screen kept scrolling.<ref name="TSCb">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル 特設ページ|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name="STGv4a">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Yūsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=東亜プラン特集 - 元・東亜プラン 開発者インタビュー: 上村建也|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=33–40|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023755/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref>

When creating the artwork for ''Tiger-Heli'', which has been described as "[[polygonal]]" in recent interviews, Toaplan was realizing research for a possible [[flight simulator]] they could develop themselves and one of the project's [[Video game designer|designer]]s implemented a sample image from the simulator into the game.<ref name="TSCb"/> The concept of using a bomb in a shoot 'em up game came up during development, where the team questioned how to make the title more engaging for players but it was never intended for defensive purposes according to them, as the mechanic was instead implemented to provide an aggressive feeling against enemies during difficult situations in the title.<ref name="TSCb"/><ref name="STGv4a"/><ref name="STGv4b">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Yūsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=東亜プラン特集 - 元・東亜プラン 開発者インタビュー: 弓削雅稔|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=41–48|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023744/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref> Several other features were integrated into the project as a way to keep audiences playing such as the continuous stage scrolling during the high score screen, which was akin to a [[drama]].<ref name="TSCb"/> According to Uemura, development was financed with the team's own funds, as Taito solely focused on distribution and Toaplan's name could not be displayed in the game due to contractual arrangements.<ref name="STGv4a"/><ref name="TSCa">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=14 November 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030143/https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711134859/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/|date=2018-07-11}}).</ref>

''Tiger-Heli'' was released in arcades across Japan and North America in October 1985 by Taito and Romstar.<ref name="MBASICM112"/> On 21 November 1988, an album containing music from the title and its sequel was co-published exclusively in Japan by [[Scitron]] and [[Pony Canyon]].<ref name="VGMDB"/>

On 5 December 1986, a Nintendo Entertainment System port of ''Tiger-Heli'' developed by Micronics was first released in Japan by Pony Canyon.

According to Masahiro Yuge, ''Tiger-Heli'' proved to be popular in arcades during initial beta location testings.<ref name="G49"/><ref name="TSCb"/><ref name="STGv4b"/> In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed it on their October 1, 1985 issue as being the most popular table arcade game at the time, outperforming titles such as ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)|Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' and ''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=269|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 October 1985|page=31|lang=ja}}</ref>
