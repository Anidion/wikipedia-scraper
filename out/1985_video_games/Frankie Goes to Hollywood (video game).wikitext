'''''Frankie Goes to Hollywood''''' is a computer game that was developed by [[Denton Designs]] and published by [[Ocean Software Ltd]] in 1985 for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] home computers.  The game is based on the music of UK band [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Frankie Goes to Hollywood & Gets There Behind the 'Wheel' of a Classic Commodore 64|first=Kit|last=MacFarlane|date=11 January 2011|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/134877-frankie-goes-to-hollywood-commodore-64-ocean-software-1985/}}</ref>

==Objective==
[[Image:Frankie Goes To Hollywood Screenshot.png|thumb]]
The game puts the player in Liverpool in search of the Pleasuredome. The player has to find and use various objects and play [[minigame]]s to reach the goal. The player starts the game as a simple character, to reach the Pleasuredome one has to become a full person. To become a full person, the four attributes ([[sex]], [[war]], [[love]] and [[faith]]) must be filled to 99%. The attributes are boosted by completing tasks in the game. Additional pleasure points can be scored by playing the minigames. The four attributes are part of the symbols used on the covers of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's albums.

During the game, a murder takes place. All the rooms the player can visit contain clues in order to find the murderer. The clues are in pairs, helping eliminate suspects. For example, the player may be told "The killer is an atheist" and "Mr Somebody is a regular church-goer" - so Mr Somebody would be innocent. In theory, the game cannot be completed without making the correct accusation (by returning to the room with the body) - there is a large bonus of Pleasure Points for naming the killer.

==Sex/Pleasure/Lust==
The first icon, represented by two sperm in a [[yin yang]] image, is variously described as either Sex, Lust or Pleasure. The game inlay refers to the icon as [[Pleasure]], the music press usually referred to it as [[Sex]], and some computer magazines occasionally used the term [[Lust]] instead.<ref>Your Sinclair issue 19</ref>
