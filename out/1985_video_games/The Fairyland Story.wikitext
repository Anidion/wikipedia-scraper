{{nihongo foot|'''''The Fairyland Story'''''|フェアリーランドストーリー|Fearīrando Sutōrī|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[Platform game|platform]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Taito]] in 1985. In the game, the player controls the witch Ptolemy, with the objective being to clear the screen of all enemies. Ptolemy can use her wand to turn the enemies into large cakes, which she can then push off of platforms onto other enemies, which will squash them and award bonus points. Various items that increase Ptolemy's projectile radius, as well as kill multiple enemies at the same time, will also appear throughout the stages.

Gameplay has been compared to later Taito platform games, such as ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'' and ''[[The NewZealand Story]]''. It has been ported to various home systems, and has seen releases in various Taito compilations.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Fairyland Story.png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]
''The Fairyland Story'' is a platform arcade game. The player controls the witch Ptolemy through a series of single-screen stages, with the objective being to defeat all of the enemies on each screen. Ptolemy's main weapon is her projectile magic, which will temporarily transform the enemies into large cakes.<ref name="HG101"/> While in a "caked" form, the enemies can be destroyed either by further magic attacks or by being dropped off a platform, possibly squashing other enemies below.<ref name="HG101"/> Squashing more than one enemy results in an award of more points and, sometimes, in extra bonuses. 2000 points are awarded for squashing an enemy below a cake, with each additional enemy doubling the number of points awarded.<ref name="HG101"/> If two or more enemies are killed at once in one spot, a coin will appear in that spot, which may be collected for additional points, and if more are collected, will multiply in points, so as long the player doesn't lose a life.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Tursi |first1=Lee |title=Fairyland Story, The |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/fairyland-story-the/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=16 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216051225/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/fairyland-story-the/ |archive-date=16 December 2019 |date=15 December 2019}}</ref>

Ptolemy's enemies are based upon typical fantasy beings - these include Orcs,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> pig-like soldiers, Salamanders,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> dragon-like creatures that can breathe fire, Wizards,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> mages that can make Ptolemy shrink and disappear, Clerics,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> bishops who can multiply themselves, [[Golem]]s,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> and Wraiths,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> hooded creatures can phase through Ptolemy's magic.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> If Ptolemy takes too long to clear a level of a last remaining enemy, eventually that enemy will disappear without an award of points.<ref name="HG101"/> If, however, Ptolemy takes too long to clear more than one enemy from the level, a flying devil, named Horned,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> appears to kill Ptolemy. The devil is invulnerable to Ptolemy's magic, and the only way to survive is for Ptolemy to kill all remaining enemies.<ref name="HG101"/>

Ptolemy's deaths are animated in different ways, depending on the enemy who kills her.<ref name="HG101" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=Wheaton|first=Wil|date=11 September 2006|title=Games of our Lives: The Fairyland Story|url=https://games.avclub.com/the-fairyland-story-1798209758|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107214341/https://games.avclub.com/the-fairyland-story-1798209758|archive-date=7 November 2019|access-date=26 September 2020|website=[[The A.V.

==Development and release==
''The Fairyland Story'' was released by [[Taito]] in Japan in July 1985<ref name="ATVGL:JaO1971-2005">{{cite book |last=Akagi |first=Masumi |url=https://archive.org/stream/ArcadeGameList1971-2005#page/n43/mode/1up |title=アーケードTVゲームリスト 国内•海外編 (1971-2005) |date=13 October 2006 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement News Agency]] |isbn=978-4990251215 |edition=1st |pages=42 |language=ja}}</ref> and in North America later that year. It was designed by Hiroshi "ONIJUST" Tsujino, best known for designing ''[[The Ninja Warriors (1987 video game)|The Ninja Warriors]]'', with music composed by Y.

==Reception and legacy==
Retrospective views on ''The Fairyland Story'' have been mixed to positive. A mini review of the game in a ''The NewZealand Story'' retrospective in an issue of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' claimed the game as "nothing special" due to its level designs and simplistic gameplay mechanics.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|date=25 April 2013|title=Ultimate Guide: The New Zealand Story|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|volume=115|pages=58}}</ref> [[PlayStation Official Magazine – UK|''PlayStation Official Magazine - UK'']], while reviewing ''Taito Legends Power Up'', unfavorably compared it to ''[[Parasol Stars]]'', referring to it as a "dress rehearsal" for ''Parasol Stars''.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|date=December 2006|title=Taito Legends Power-Up Review|journal=[[PlayStation Official Magazine – UK]]|volume=08|pages=87}}</ref> When criticizing the fact that ''Bubble Bobble'' was a locked game in ''Taito Memories Jokan'', ''Hardcore Gamer'' said that while one could "make do" with it and ''[[Don Doko Don]]'', ultimately stated that it was "decaf when you want espresso".<ref>{{Cite journal|date=September 2005|title=Taito Memories Jokan Review|url=https://archive.org/details/hardcore-gamer-magazine-v1i4|journal=Hardcore Gamer|volume=1i4|pages=77|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> When reviewing ''Taito Legends 2'', ''[[Eurogamer]]'' wrote that the game was "hugely additive", although criticized it for the lack of co-op play.<ref name=":5">{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Kristan|date=2006-03-31|title=Taito Legends 2|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_taitolegends2_ps2|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002151159/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_taitolegends2_ps2|archive-date=2 October 2019|access-date=2015-06-27|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Eurogamer.net}}</ref> A more in-depth retrospective review on the game by ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' was more positive, praising the game for its detailed graphics (for the time) and its risk-versus-reward gameplay elements.<ref name="HG101" /> While criticizing the game for being too punishing for beginner players, and for denying players the right to continue on rounds 99 through 101, they said that the game was "highly recommended" for people that are "into cute platformer games and/or ''Bubble Bobble''-like games".<ref name="HG101" /> However, it was noted that the Sharp X68000 version was the best way to play the game, due to the addition of the save system, as well as the fact that it lets players continue anytime they liked.<ref name="HG101" />

The game's inclusion in ''Taito Milestones'' has similarly led to a mixed to positive response. Some review sites, like ''multiplayer.it'', ''Gaming Age'', and ''[[TouchArcade]]'', praised it for its mechanics, with some minor criticisms from the latter two.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Taito Milestones, la recensione della raccolta di vecchie glorie Taito |url=https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/taito-milestones-recensione.html |access-date=2023-09-04 |website=Multiplayer.it |language=it}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Dunlap |first=Chris |date=2022-04-29 |title=TAITO Milestones review for Nintendo Switch |url=https://gaming-age.com/2022/04/taito-milestones-review-for-nintendo-switch/ |access-date=2023-09-04 |website=Gaming Age |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-12 |title=SwitchArcade Round-Up: Reviews Featuring 'Taito Milestones', Plus '13 Sentinels' and the Latest Sales – TouchArcade |url=https://toucharcade.com/2022/04/12/taito-milestones-switch-review-13-sentinels-nintendo-eshop-deals-sales-prices-list/ |access-date=2023-09-04 |language=en-US}}</ref> Others like ''Hardcore Gamer'' and ''Nintendo World Report'' unfavorably compared it to ''Bubble Bobble''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-12 |title=Review: Taito Milestones - Hardcore Gamer |url=https://hardcoregamer.com/reviews/review-taito-milestones/421345/ |access-date=2023-09-04 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Taito Milestones Review - Review |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/60117/taito-milestones-switch-review |access-date=2023-09-04 |website=Nintendo World Report}}</ref>

''The Fairyland Story'' is often considered to be one of the spiritual predecessors to ''Bubble Bobble'', mostly due to the similar gameplay mechanics.<ref name="HG101" /> Gameplay elements and power-ups from ''The Fairyland Story'' would later be used in ''The NewZealand Story''.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|date=10 January 2014|title=The Ultimate Guide To The New Zealand Story|url=https://www.nowgamer.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-new-zealand-story/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903051615/https://www.nowgamer.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-new-zealand-story/|archive-date=3 September 2018|access-date=24 September 2020|website=NowGamer}}</ref> A block formation that resembles Ptolemy appears as a hidden level in ''The NewZealand Story''.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" /> A hidden world in [[Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2|''Rainbow Islands'']], called Magical Island, is based on ''The Fairyland Story''.<ref name="HG101" /><ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Definitive Bubble Bobble|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|volume=28|pages=59}}</ref> The Worm enemy would later appear in both ''Don Doko Don'' and ''[[Don Doko Don 2]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tursi|first=Lee|date=16 April 2020|title=Don Doko Don 2|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/don-doko-don-2/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925221835/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/don-doko-don-2/|archive-date=25 September 2020|access-date=25 September 2020|website=Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref>
