'''''Commando''''', released as {{nihongo||戦場の狼|'''Senjō no Ōkami'''|"Wolf of the Battlefield"|lead=yes}} in Japan, is a vertically scrolling [[run and gun video game]] released by [[Capcom]] for [[Arcade video game|arcades]] in 1985. The game was designed by [[Tokuro Fujiwara]]. It was distributed in North America by [[Data East]], and in Europe by several companies including Capcom, Deith Leisure and [[Sega, S.A. SONIC]]. Versions were released for various [[home computer]]s and [[video game console]]s. It is unrelated to the [[Commando (1985 film)|1985 film of the same name]], which was released six months after the game.

''Commando'' was a critical and commercial success, becoming one of the highest-grossing arcade video games of 1985 and one of the best-selling home video games of 1986. It was highly influential, spawning numerous clones following its release, while popularizing the [[Run and gun game|run-and-gun shooter]] genre. Its influence can be seen in many later [[shooter games]], especially those released during the late 1980s to early 1990s.

The game later appeared on ''[[Capcom Classics Collection]]'', ''[[Activision Anthology]]'', and on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] Arcade, as well as ''[[Capcom Arcade Cabinet]]'' for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. A sequel, ''[[Mercs]]'', was released in 1989.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:Commando-mame.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot]]
The player takes control of a soldier named Super Joe,<ref name=worldflyer>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcadeflyers.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=219|title=The Arcade Flyer Archive - Video Game: Commando, Capcom}}</ref> who starts by being dropped off in a jungle by a helicopter, and has to fight his way out singlehandedly, fending off a massive assault of enemy soldiers.

Super Joe is armed with an assault rifle (which has unlimited ammunition) as well as a limited supply of hand grenades. While Joe can fire his gun in any of the eight directions that he faces, his grenades can only be thrown vertically towards the top of the screen, irrespective of the direction Joe is facing. Unlike his assault rifle bullets, grenades can be thrown to clear obstacles, and explosions from well-placed grenades can kill several enemies at once.

At the end of each level, the screen stops, and the player must fight several soldiers streaming from a gate or fortress. They are ordered out by a cowardly officer, who immediately runs away, although shooting him in the back awards the player bonus points. Along the way, one can attempt to free prisoners of war as they are transported across the screen by the enemy.

Some home console ports of the game contain hidden underground shelters that can only be accessed with grenades. Inside these shelters are prisoners for the player to rescue. Some of these ports also include items. Among the items included in the NES version are a more powerful machine gun upgrade, an unlimited grenade upgrade, and "glasses" to let the player view all the hidden bunkers. The player will lose these upgrades after losing a life.

Extra lives are given at 10,000 points, and per 50,000 scored up to 960,000; thereafter, no more lives. Play continues to the last Super Joe dead, which ends the game.

The arcade version contains eight unique levels. The NES version contains only four unique level designs, but repeats those levels with minor changes and increasing difficulty to create a total of sixteen levels. 

==Development==
The game was developed by Capcom, where it was designed by [[Tokuro Fujiwara]]. He was concurrently leading the development of both ''Commando'' and ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)|Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' at the same time. Both games sold well for Capcom upon release.<ref name="Continue12">{{cite magazine |title=The Man Who Made Ghosts'n Goblins |magazine=[[:ja:CONTINUE (雑誌)|Continue]] |volume=12 |date=October 2003 |url=https://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/tokuro-fujiwara/}}</ref>

== Ports ==
A home version of the game developed by Capcom was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. [[Activision]] released a port of the game for the [[Atari 2600]] and INTV released a port for the [[Intellivision]], also an [[Atari 7800]] version by [[Sculptured Software]] was released in 1989.

[[Elite Systems|Elite]] released versions for many home computers. They released the [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[BBC Micro]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] versions in November 1985.<ref name="CVG-50">{{cite magazine |title=The Smash Hit No. 1 Arcade Game! Commando |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 November 1985 |issue=50 (December 1985) |pages=2–3 |url=https://archive.org/details/computer-video-games-magazine-050/page/n1/mode/2up}}</ref> The BBC Micro and [[Acorn Electron]] versions were developed under contract by Catalyst Coders, while Elite developed the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], Acorn Electron, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 versions.

The Commodore 64 port's theme, a more complex and extended version of the arcade music, was created in less than 12 hours by [[Rob Hubbard]], "&#91;I&#93; started working on it late at night, and worked on it through the night. I took one listen to the original arcade version and started working on the C64 version. &#91;...&#93; By the time everyone arrived at 8:00 in the morning, I had loaded the main tune on every C64 in the building! I got my cheque and was on a train home by 10:00".

The arcade version was re-released on the [[Virtual Console]] as ''Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando'' in Japan on October 5, 2010, in North America on December 6, 2010, and in the PAL region on December 17, 2010.

===Unreleased versions===
A version for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was created by [[Sculptured Software]] in 1989, intended to be released by [[Atari Corporation]] for the [[Atari XEGS|XEGS]]. However, although the game appeared in Atari catalogs of the time,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Atari Advantage |url=http://www.atarimania.com/catalog-atari-atari-usa-_122_8.html |year=1989 |publisher=[[Atari Corporation]] |access-date=2011-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Atari Video Game Catalog |url=http://www.atarimania.com/catalog-atari-atari-usa-c034003-rev-a_123_8.html |year=1987 |publisher=[[Atari Corporation]] |access-date=2011-02-08}}</ref> it never reached the market in spite of being completed.

===Impact===
''Commando'' was a highly influential game, popularizing the [[Run and gun game|run-and-gun shooter]] genre along with military shooter themes. It led to run-and-gun games becoming the dominant style of [[shoot 'em up]] during the late 1980s to early 1990s, when ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' called ''Commando'' "the great grand-daddy of the modern shoot 'em up" genre.<ref name="ysguide2">Bielby, Matt, [https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/your-sinclair/56#19 "The YS Complete Guide To Shoot-'em-ups Part II"], ''Your Sinclair,'' August 1990 (issue 56), p. 19</ref> It has also been credited as the "product that shot" Capcom to "8-bit [[silicon]] stardom" in 1985, "closely followed by" ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)|Ghosts 'n Goblins]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Capcom: A Captive Audience |magazine=[[The Games Machine]] |date=18 May 1989 |issue=19 (June 1989) |pages=24–5 |url=https://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-19/page/n23/mode/2up}}</ref>

===Sequels and successors===
''Commando'' was followed by a sequel titled ''[[Mercs]]'' in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]], which was known as ''Senjō no Ōkami II'' in Japan. However, it was not as successful as ''Commando'' or ''Ikari Warriors''. Tokuro Fujiwara was disappointed that he did not develop a ''Commando'' sequel sooner, as the arcade market already had numerous ''Commando'' imitators by the time ''Mercs'' released.<ref name="Continue12"/><ref name="Continue0"/> A second sequel, ''[[Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3]]'' was released as a downloadable title for the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and the [[PlayStation Network]] in [[2008 in video gaming|2008]].

Outside Japan, the arcade version of ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade game)|Bionic Commando]]'' was marketed as a sequel to ''Commando'' and the main character, a nameless soldier in the game, is identified as "Super Joe" in an American brochure for the game. Super Joe would appear as an actual supporting character in the later versions of ''[[Bionic Commando (NES)|Bionic Commando]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Game Boy]], as well as in ''[[Bionic Commando: Elite Forces]]''. In the [[2009 in video gaming|2009]] version of ''[[Bionic Commando (2009 video game)|Bionic Commando]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], the character of Super Joe is identified as Joseph Gibson, one of the three player characters in ''Mercs''.

The game ''Duet'' by Elite Systems Ltd was also called first "Commando '86" then "Commando '87".<ref>{{WoS game|id=0001534|name=Duet}}</ref>
