'''''Déjà Vu'''''<ref>[[Accent marks]] do not appear on the original game boxes or in-game logo, where the title is written as ''Deja Vu''. However, accent marks appear in the text on the back of the box and in the logos for the NES and Game Boy Color ports. Some sources also add an additional [[Subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] of "A Nightmare Comes True!!", a [[tagline]] that is absent from the in-game logo and NES game box.</ref> is a [[point-and-click]] [[adventure game]] set in the world of 1940s [[hardboiled]] detective novels and films. It was released in 1985 for [[Macintosh]] – the first in the [[MacVenture]] series – and later [[game port|ported]] to several other systems, including the [[Amiga]]. Initially, the game featured [[black and white]] graphics, and later releases introduced color.

==Plot and gameplay==
[[Image:DejaVu Mac Screenshot.png|left|thumb|Macintosh version of ''Déjà Vu'']]
The game takes place in [[Chicago]] during December 1941. The game character is Theodore "Ace" Harding, a retired boxer working as a [[Private investigator|private eye]].

Ace awakes one morning in a bathroom stall, unable to remember who he is. The bathroom stall turns out to be in Joe's Bar. A dead man is found in an upstairs office, and Ace is about to be framed for the murder. There are some clues as to the identity of the murdered man and to Ace himself. A strap-down chair, mysterious vials, and a syringe are found, suggesting (together with a needle mark on Ace's arm) that an [[interrogation]] has taken place.

Outside the bar, Ace encounters adversaries including a mugger, an old acquaintance with a grudge, and the police. Ace's boxing background proves to be a valuable asset. Ace must find addresses around Joe's bar and then make taxi rides to a few locations (including his office) to gather more elements and unravel the story. It involves a kidnapping in which Ace has played some part, but his memory lacks important details.

Ace's memory and mental condition progressively deteriorate, so the player is required to obtain an antidote to the drug that caused the memory loss. After that, Ace has recurring flashbacks filled with information that help the player to evaluate the evidence and take action accordingly. The memory deterioration is handled differently in the Nintendo platforms compared to all others, in all others the player has a limited amount of time before Ace's brain reaches vegetable status and has to live the rest of his days in a hospital for "helpless mental invalids" with a hard death coded on the second floor of Sternwood Mansion. Nintendo platforms mostly remove the vegetable status mechanic and also removes the Sternwood Mansion death if the player goes there without curing their amnesia giving the player all the time they need to get cured but instead has a hard death coded if the player goes to Ace's office while still suffering from amnesia in which the vegetable ending from the other platforms is immediately initiated. These changes apply to both the Nintendo and Gameboy Color versions.

This game and its sequel, ''[[Deja Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas]]'', require significant [[lateral thinking]]. Some situations are based in common [[detective#Techniques|detective techniques]], while others require simple violence. Unlike other MacVentures titles (such as ''[[Uninvited (video game)|Uninvited]]'' and ''[[Shadowgate]]''), no supernatural events are involved.

==Technology==
[[Image:Deja vu screenshot nes.png|thumb|right|[[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version]]
''Déjà Vu'' was the first [[ICOM Simulations]] game to use the [[MacVenture]] interface and engine.

Numerous ports were made, including versions for home computer systems in 1987 and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990. Versions of the game and its sequel containing new graphics and sound were released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in the early 1990s, and later as a combined single-cartridge release for the [[Game Boy Color]] in 1999 under the title ''Déjà Vu I & II: The Casebooks of Ace Harding'', which was also released for DOS, [[Windows 3.x]] (1992), and [[Windows Mobile]] (2002). The Game Boy Color version has even more censorship and creates its own detail such as renaming "Joe's Bar" to "Joe's Place" and adding details that were not present in other versions to the point of contradiction, most notably with Ace's "Suzy Q" memory and "Father O'Malley" memory. This version also changes the ending of the first Deja Vu game to better seamlessly lead into Deja Vu II.

==Reception==
''Déjà Vu '' was reviewed positively in ''[[Macworld]]'', which called it "a well-crafted game that's bound to draw you into its intriguing, albeit seedy, story." ''Macworld'' noted how the game's point-and-click interface set it apart from [[text parser]]-based adventure games, freeing the player from "having to second guess the program's vocabulary and syntax".<ref>{{cite magazine

''Macworld'' inducted ''Déjà Vu'' into its 1986 Game Hall of Fame in the Best Adventure Game category, praising the game for avoiding the common adventure game pitfall of puzzle-solving overwhelming the game's literary possibilities: "Aside from its debt to the ''[[film noir]]'' tradition, it discards verbal pretensions and lets you mouse-and-window your way to a solution to a [[hardboiled|hard-boiled]] murder tale."<ref>{{cite magazine
