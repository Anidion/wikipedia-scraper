Greg Williams of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised the Atari version's graphics but asked "How likely is it that a game with girls, mice, cats, and magic mushrooms should be called ''Lode Runner's Rescue''?" He speculated that the publisher put the series name on an unrelated and independently developed game.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Atari Playfield | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&pub=2&id=25 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=Janâ€“Feb 1986 | author=Williams, Gregg | page=32}}</ref>

Roy Wagner reviewed the Commodore 64 version for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' and praised the ability of creating the player's screens with icon screen editor.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Wagner |first=Roy |title=The Commodore Key |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=March 1986 |volume=1 |issue=26 |pages=38}}</ref>
