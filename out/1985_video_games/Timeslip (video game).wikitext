'''''Timeslip''''' is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] written by Jon Williams for the [[Commodore 16]] / [[Commodore Plus/4]] computers and published by [[English Software]] in 1985. A version for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] followed a year later.<ref name=giantlist/> The game was described by reviewers as "three versions of [[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]] rolled into one".<ref name="commodoreuser"/>

==Gameplay==

In ''Timeslip'' the player is presented with the screen divided into three sections or time zones. The top section is the planet surface with the player controlling a fighter, the middle section is set in underground cavers, and in the bottom section the player controls a mini-sub. The object of the game is to destroy 36 orbs placed within the three sections and synchronize the clocks in all three zones to 00.00 hours. If a player is hit, they receive a 30 minute penalty. In addition, if a player is hit five times, a "timeslip" occurs, which is a desynchronisation of all clocks. Sections are played one at a time and the player can switch zones at will, leaving the other two frozen in time.

==Reception==
''Timeslip'' received mostly positive reviews. ''[[Your Commodore]]'' reviewer summed up ''Timeslip'' as the best game he had seen on the C16, and he recommended it without hesitation.<ref name="yourcommodore"/> The review in ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine was equally positive: "Timeslip's designer and programmer, Jon Williams, has come up with a nifty and exciting little game. C16 owners should raise three cheers for him "<ref name="cvg"/>
