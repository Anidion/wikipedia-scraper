'''''Clash of Wills''''' is a [[computer wargame]] published in 1985 by Digital Kamp Group for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]]<ref name=mania/> and [[Commodore 64]].<ref name=gb64/>

==Gameplay==
''Clash of Wills'' is a game in which the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] of Europe during [[World War II]] (1940-1945) is simulated.<ref name="CGW29"/>

==Reception==
M. Evan Brooks reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "This reviewer has mixed feelings about the product. The scope of the simulation is laudable; its execution is not. Its failures could well have been corrected with some additional development. The designers did not choose to do so, and the net result is a game with a potential for greatness, but a realization of minimal adequacy, at best."<ref name="CGW29">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M.
