'''''Swords and Sorcery''''' is a [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game|role playing]] video game developed and published by [[Personal Software Services]]. It was released exclusively in the United Kingdom for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1985 and the [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1986. The game contains elements of [[dungeon crawl]]ing and revolves around a customisable player-character navigating through catacombs in order to secure a large wealth of treasure, whilst simultaneously collecting seven pieces of sacred armour.

The game was released with dedicated [[t-shirt]]s, badges and posters. It suffered from several delays throughout 1985 due to the complexity of programming. ''Swords and Sorcery'' received positive reviews from critics upon release; prominent praise included the graphics, colours, animation and its menu interface. It also won the "Game of the Month" award from ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' in January 1986.

==Gameplay==

''Swords and Sorcery'' is presented in a [[first person (video games)|first person]] [[top-down perspective]] and contains elements of [[dungeon crawl]]ing, a common trait of [[role playing game|role playing]] video games.<ref name=crash/><ref name=YS/> The game is set in a fictional land called Zob, in which he main objective is to explore its catacombs and discover a large wealth of treasure, alongside collecting seven pieces of sacred Zob armour. The game begins with allowing the player to choose their player-character; the default protagonist is called Flubbit the Dull, however there is an option to allow the player to create and personalise their own character.<ref name=crash/> Once a character has been created, a 14 in-game day training scheme will commence which gives the player an opportunity to improve their abilities such as [[lock picking]], sword fighting and thieving. An in-game armoury is also accessible at any time, which includes utilities such as body armour and various weaponry. The form of currency in the game is [[dragon]]'s teeth, which can be used to purchase items and equipment.<ref name=crash/>

Movement through the catacombs is controlled by command inputs and keywords, which is referred to in-game as MIDAS.<ref name=crash/> For example, entering in the word "hit" will bring down a menu which will display various forms of attacking techniques.<ref name=CVG/> The left side of the screen displays an animated first person perspective of the respective tunnel or room the player is in, whereas the right side of the interface displays a general top-down view of the catacombs.<ref name=YS/> The bottom of the screen features a command box and announces available options or hints to the player; flashing arrows indicate where movement is possible throughout the catacombs. During the game, enemies such as gargoyles, catmen and warriors will appear at random and attack the player if confronted.<ref name=CGG/> Magic spells such as poison and fire are able to defeat enemies, alongside weaponry such as swords and axes.<ref name=crash/><ref name=CVG/> The player-character has both a health and magic bar, which will slowly deplete once attacked by an enemy or by using magic spells, respectively.<ref name=CGG>{{cite magazine |title=Swords & Sorcery |magazine=Computer Gamer |issue=9 |date=December 1985 |publisher=Argus Specialist Publications |pages=12–14 |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gamer_Issue_09_1985-12_Argus_Press_GB#page/n11/mode/2up |access-date=16 January 2016}}</ref> Items in the game include treasure<ref name=YS/> and artefacts which may have a chance of giving the player negative effects, such as draining life and paralysing movement.<ref name=crash/>

The game received positive reviews upon release. Rachael Smith of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' praised the imaginative atmosphere the game offered, stating that developers drew the players into a "convincing world" and speculated that the game would become a "cult of sorts".<ref name=YS>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Rachael|title=Swords And Sorcery review|journal=Your Sinclair|date=February 1896|issue=2|page=29|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/swordsandsorcery.htm|access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref> Philippa Irving of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' praised the presentation as "super" and the graphics as "rare for this type of game", adding that it also offered "brilliant" animation which shows the detail in the "best way possible".<ref name=crash>{{cite journal|last1=Irving|first1=Philippa|title=Swords and Sorcery review (Crash)|journal=Crash|date=December 1985|issue=24|page=162|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/24/sorcery.htm|access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref> Gary Rook of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' opinionated that ''Swords and Sorcery'' was aimed at "[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]-style" dungeon explorers. Regarding the graphics, Rook stated that they were "not staggering", but felt that they served a purpose and would have been "deadly dull" if the game was text-based only.<ref name=SU>{{cite journal|last1=Rook|first1=Gary|title=Swords and Sorcery review|journal=Sinclair User|date=February 1986|issue=47|pages=83. 84|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/SinclairUser/Issue047/Pages/SinclairUser04700083.jpg|access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref>

A reviewer of ''ZX Computing'' called it the best ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' version "ever produced on a computer", and stated that it was "worth the wait".<ref name=ZX>{{cite journal|title=Swords and Sorcery review|journal=ZX Computing|date=March 1986|issue=86|page=40|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/ZXComputing/Issue8602/Pages/ZXComputing860200040.jpg|access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref> A reviewer of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' stated that the game was "unique" and could not be classified. However, the reviewer did criticise the speed of in-game combat, calling it "frustrating" at times. Despite this, ''Computer and Video Games'' awarded it their "Game of the Month" award for January 1986.<ref name=CVG>{{cite journal|title=Swords and Sorcery (CVG)|journal=[[Computer and Video Games]]|date=February 1986|issue=15|pages=14, 15|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue051/Pages/CVG05100014.jpg|access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref> Robert Fripp of German magazine ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' concluded that the game presented a "successful" adventure.<ref name=ASM>{{cite journal|last1=Fripp|first1=Robert|title=Geheimnisvoll (Swords and Sorcery review)|journal=[[Aktueller Software Markt]]|date=April 1986|issue=83|page=89|url=https://archive.org/stream/asm_magazine-1986-04/ASM_04_1986#page/n83/mode/2up|access-date=30 December 2015|language=German}}</ref> Bob Wade of ''[[Amstrad Action]]'' praised the game's presentation, depth and atmosphere but criticized initial complexity and required time commitment.<ref name=AMA>{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=Bob|title=Swords and Sorcery review|journal=[[Amstrad Action]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=June 1986|issue=9|pages=64, 66|url=https://archive.org/stream/AmstradAction052/AmstradAction/AmstradAction009#page/n63/mode/2up|access-date=2 January 2016}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' received the game highly positively, calling it complex, difficult and immersive, giving particularly high points to atmosphere.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Adventure Reviews – Swords & Sorcery |magazine=Computer Gamer |author=G.H. |issue=15 |date=June 1986 |publisher=Argus Specialist Publications |page=36 |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gamer_Issue_15_1986-06_Argus_Press_GB#page/n35/mode/2up |access-date=16 January 2016}}</ref>

In a later retrospect of role-playing games, ''[[Advanced Computer Entertainment]]'' noted that a common criticism of the game was that it was similar to "exploring an [[National Car Parks|NCP]] car park", however the reviewer praised the game's ability to portray a "complex" world.<ref name=ACE>{{cite journal|title=Role Up|journal=[[Advanced Computer Entertainment]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=November 1988|issue=14|page=100|url=https://archive.org/stream/ACE_Issue_14_1988-11_Future_Publishing_GB#page/n99/mode/2up|access-date=2 January 2016}}</ref>
