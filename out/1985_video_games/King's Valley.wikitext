'''''King's Valley''''' is a [[platform game]] released by Konami for [[MSX]] in 1985. The game is considered a spiritual successor to Konami's earlier arcade game ''[[Tutankham]]'' (1982), employing similar concepts such as treasure hunting in Egyptian tombs and an identical end-level music tune.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Tutankham |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tutankham/ |access-date=20 May 2021 |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> It also has similarities to ''[[Lode Runner]]'' (1983).

The game was initially released on [[ROM cartridge]] with 15 levels. It was also planned to be released on [[floppy disk]] with 60 levels but that version was shelved. The floppy disk version would ultimately be released a few years later in 1988 as part of ''Konami Game Collection Vol. 1'' on MSX.

==Gameplay==
''King's Valley'' is a game with [[puzzle]] elements, in which the player controls an archaeologist exploring a tomb in search of jewels. On his way, the hero encounters an army of multi-colored mummies chasing him and uses throwing knives for protection. To reach the hidden gems, the archaeologist needs to use special tools, such as pickaxes, which allow him to dig through brick walls. There are a total of 15 rooms in the game, some of which occupy two screens, and only after collecting all the jewels on the level, the door to the next stage opens.<ref name="hardcoregaming">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/kings-valley/|title=King's Valley|lang=en|author=Derboo, Sam|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=2012-10-22|access-date=2024-03-12}}</ref>

==Versions==
In 1998, ''King's Valley'' was included in the ''[[Konami Antiques MSX Collection|Konami Antiques MSX Collection Vol. 3]]'' compilation for [[PlayStation]], and later in the ''Ultra Pack'' for [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]]. In 2002, a mobile version of the game was released. Despite the original MSX version being published in Europe, none of the re-releases were released outside of Japan. There is an unofficial port of the game for [[ZX Spectrum]], created in 2009 by Retro Works. There is also a version for MSX on floppy disks, containing 60 levels instead of 15 and a level editor. This version is included in the ''Konami Game Collection Vol. 1'' compilation.<ref name="hardcoregaming" />
