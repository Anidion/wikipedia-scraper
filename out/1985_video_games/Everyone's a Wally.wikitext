'''''Everyone's a Wally''''' is a British [[video game]] released in 1985 by [[Mikro-Gen]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Commodore 64]]. The sequel to ''[[Pyjamarama]]'', it features the same hero character, ''Wally Week'', and uses an upgraded version of the same game engine.

==Gameplay==

''Everyone's a Wally'' was the first arcade adventure game to feature multiple playable characters: Wally Week (a builder and [[handyman]]), Wilma (his wife), Tom (a [[Punk subculture|punk]] mechanic), Dick (a plumber) and Harry (a [[hippie]] electrician).<ref name="cassetteinlay">{{cite web|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/zxdb/sinclair/entries/0001677/EveryonesAWally_Back.jpg|title=Everyone's a Wally|access-date=19 November 2021}}</ref> Herbert, the baby son of Wally and Wilma, appeared in the game as a mobile hazard [[Non-player character#Video games|NPC]]. The player can change character when in the same location as another - those not being controlled wander around the village carrying on their own chores and business. The character switch and the chores attendance simulation were original at the time. The energy ("endurance") of each character is decreased when in contact with NPCs; the game ends if characters deplete their energy.

The aim of the game is to complete a day's worth of work for each character and retrieve the compensation at the bank, to allow the well deserved "break" - as the code of the firm registered at the bank will spell - from job to job. The player will find out that Wally can build a wall at the construction site and maintain the cranes at the dock (and more) to obtain his part of the check; Wilma will act as a librarian etc. The game is a structure of puzzles where jobs successfully carried on enable to unlock more accomplishments: repairing the fountain enables collecting water to make cement to build the wall, etc.

==Development==

''Everyone's a Wally'' started out as ''Life of Wally'' and was written by Chris Hinsley in 1985 - although in an interview with [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]], Paul Denial stated that the entire Mikro-Gen team had input into both character design and coding.<ref>Crash, issue 13, pages 36-38</ref>

The game (as ''Life'') was given an advance mention in ''[[Pyjamarama]]'', released the year before.

==Song==
The original tape cassette version of ''Everyone's a Wally'' featured a [[Mike Berry (singer)|Mike Berry]] song about the game recorded as an audio track on the B side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/14/wally.htm|title=CRASH 14 - Everyone's a Wally}}</ref>
