{{nihongo|'''''Road Blaster'''''|ロードブラスター}} is an [[interactive movie]] [[video game]] developed by [[Data East]] featuring animation by [[Toei Animation]], originally released exclusively in [[Japan]] as a [[laserdisc]]-based [[arcade game]] in [[1985 in video games|1985]]. The player assumes the role of a vigilante who must avenge the death of his wife by pursuing the biker gang responsible for her death in a modified sports car. The game would later be ported to a variety of home formats such as the [[MSX]] and [[Sharp X1]] ([[Video High Density|VHD]] format), [[Sega CD]] (under the title of '''''Road Blaster FX'''''), [[LaserActive]] (in Mega-LD format), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]] (in a compilation with ''[[Thunder Storm]]''). The Sega CD and Mega-LD versions were released outside of Japan under titles of '''''Road Avenger''''' and '''''Road Prosecutor''''' respectively.

==Gameplay==
As with other [[laserdisc]]-based arcade games from the same time, the gameplay consists of [[Quick time event|on-screen instructions]] overlaid over pre-recorded [[full motion video]] animated footage of high-speed chases and [[Vehicular combat game|vehicular combat]]. Played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]], the player controls the crosshair to steer their car toward the correct directions according to the green arrows flashing and beeping beside it, while controlling the gas pedal, brake and booster whenever they light up.

The game has nine stages. Upon successfully completing a level, the player is graded on the reaction time. Different difficulty levels can be selected. In Normal Mode, pop-up icons and audio tones signal when to turn left or right, brake, hit turbo, or hit other cars. In Hard Mode, there are no on-screen icons to guide the player.<ref name="GamePro"/>

==Plot==
The story of ''Road Blaster'' is inspired by revenge [[thriller film]]s such as ''[[Mad Max]]''.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|last=Buchanan |first=Levi |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/08/12/laser-craze-alert-road-blasters-coming |title=Laser Craze Alert - Road Blaster's Coming - IGN |publisher=IGN |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2015-05-21}}</ref> In the late 1990s United States, the player assumes the role of a vigilante who drives a customized sports car in order to get revenge on a biker gang responsible for his wife's death on their honeymoon. After recovering from his own injuries, he upgrades his car and goes on a rampage through nine areas. His goal is to seek out the gang's female boss and complete his vengeance.

==Development==
''Road Blaster'' uses animation provided by the [[anime]] studio [[Toei Animation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrocollect.com/Reviews/modern-review-road-blaster-apple-ios-devices.html |title=Modern Review: Road Blaster (Apple iOS Devices) |publisher=RetroCollect.com |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2015-05-21}}</ref> It was animated under the guidance of Yoshinobu Inano, who also directed or key-animated such films such as ''[[Gundam: Char's Counter Attack]]'', ''[[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'', and ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2011/10/09-1/video-toei-animated-road-blaster-offered-on-ios |title=VIDEO: Toei Animated "Road Blaster" Offered on iOS |publisher=Crunchyroll.com |date=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2015-05-21}}</ref> It was animated using 15,000 [[Cel animation|hand-painted cels]] to produce over 30 minutes of animation.<ref name="GamePro"/> Game director [[Yoshihisa Kishimoto]], who previously worked on ''[[Cobra Command (1984 video game)|Cobra Command]]'', later directed the arcade version of ''[[Double Dragon]]'', where the car from ''Road Blaster'' can be seen inside the Lee brothers' garage at the start of the game.

The chopper from ''[[Cobra Command (1984 video game)|Cobra Command/Thunder Storm]]'' can also be seen at the beginning of ''Road Blaster''.

==Releases==
''Road Blaster'' was originally released in 1985 as a [[laserdisc]]-based arcade game. Various ports were released throughout history, including versions for the [[MSX]], [[Sharp X1|X1]] (both in [[Video High Density|VHD]] format), [[Sega Mega-CD|Mega CD/Sega CD]], [[LaserActive]] (in Mega LD format), [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] (prototyped as ''Turbo Blaster''). However, only the Sega CD and Mega LD versions were released outside Japan, under the titles ''Road Avenger'' and ''Road Prosecutor'', respectively. The titles were possibly changed to avoid confusion with the similarly titled arcade game ''[[RoadBlasters]]'' by [[Atari Games]], which was ported to the [[Mega Drive]] around the same time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://planetarbitrary.com/2013/02/road-avenger-now-this-is-a-special-game/ |title=Road Avenger – Now this is a special game |publisher=Planetarbitrary.com |date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2015-05-21 |archive-date=2015-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227015327/http://planetarbitrary.com/2013/02/road-avenger-now-this-is-a-special-game/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Road Blaster'' was also released for the [[Sharp X68000]]<ref name="X68000">{{cite web|url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/000/G000000/20090323010/ |title=― X68対応ゲームが新発売？「ロードブラスター」（1985年発売）をWindows/X68kに移植した同梱版を5月4日発売 |publisher=4gamer.net |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2015-05-21}}</ref> and for [[Windows]] in 2011, exclusively in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/136/G013615/20110630084/ |title=― Windows版「ロードブラスター」のアップデータ兼体験版を4GamerにUp。モンスターマシンを乗りこなし，復讐を遂げろ |publisher=4gamer.net |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2015-05-21}}</ref> A unofficial [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] port of the game titled ''Super Road Blaster'' was released in 2012, which uses the MSU-1 chip support. ''Cobra Command'' and ''Road Blaster'' were ported to [[iOS]] by Revolutionary Concepts in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In 2018, a port for the [[Amiga]] ([[Original Chip Set|OCS]] and [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]]) and the [[Amiga CD32|CD32]] was also released unofficially.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://hol.abime.net/1248 | title=Road Blasters : Hall of Light - the database of Amiga games }}</ref>

Other variations included one-shot reproductions for [[VHS]] cassette players such as [[Takara]]'s ''[[Video Challenger]]'' which was a limited interactive port of the ''Road Blaster'' arcade game. The Sega Saturn and PlayStation ports were compilations of ''Road Blaster'' and another laserdisc arcade game developed by the same team titled ''Thunder Storm'' (known outside Japan as ''[[Cobra Command (1984 video game)|Cobra Command]]'').
