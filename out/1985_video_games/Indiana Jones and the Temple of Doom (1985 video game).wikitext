'''''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom''''' is an [[action game|action video game]] developed and published by [[Atari Games]] and released in arcades in 1985. It is based on the 1984 [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|film of the same name]], the second film in the [[Indiana Jones|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8186 | title = Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom | publisher = The International Arcade Museum | access-date =5 Oct 2013}}</ref> It is the first [[Atari System 1]] arcade game to include digitized speech, including voice clips of [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] and [[Amrish Puri]] as [[Mola Ram]], as well as [[John Williams]]'s music from the film.

==Gameplay==
[[File:IndianaJonesandTheTempleofDoom screenshot.png|left|thumb|Mine scene in the arcade original]]
The player assumes the role of Indiana Jones as he infiltrates the lair of the evil [[Thuggee]] cult, armed with his trademark whip. Controls consist of an eight-position joystick and a button to use the whip. The player's ultimate goal is to free the children the cult has kidnapped as slaves, recover the stolen relics known as "Sankara Stones", escape the temple, and defeat the cult leader Mola Ram.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-and-videogames-071/ComputerAndVideoGames_071_Sep_1987#page/n1/mode/2up|title=Thrill to the action as the legend comes to life!|work=Computer and Video Games|date=September 1987|access-date=August 27, 2016|pages=2{{ndash}}3}}</ref>

After selecting one of three [[difficulty level]]s, the player progresses through three stages based on different scenes from the film:

# Rescuing captive children from the mines, while avoiding Thuggee guards and other dangers such as snakes, bats, and floor spikes.
# Escaping from the Thuggee guards in a mine cart without crashing into dead ends or falling off collapsed sections of track.
# Recovering a Sankara Stone from the Thuggee sacrificial altar.

One life is lost whenever Indy touches a hazard or enemy character, falls from too great a height, crashes his mine cart, or falls into lava. The whip can be used to destroy or stun enemies and to swing across gaps in the mines.

The cycle repeats four times, adding more hazards each time. On the fourth repetition, the altar scene is replaced by a final confrontation with Mola Ram, on a rope bridge over a river. If the player completes this scene, Mola Ram falls to his death and the player advances to a bonus stage in the mines, picking up golden statues for extra points. This stage continues until all remaining lives are lost.

==Ports==
[[Port (video gaming)|Ports]] of the game were later developed by Paragon Programming and released by [[U.S. Gold]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-and-videogames-069/ComputerAndVideoGames_069_Jul_1987#page/n115/mode/2up|title=Indiana Jones Preview|work=Computer and Video Games|date=July 1987|access-date=August 27, 2016|pages=116 {{ndash}}117}}</ref> The ZX Spectrum version game went to number 1 in the [[Woolworths Group (United Kingdom)|Woolworths]] sales charts.<ref name='woolworthsnov87'>{{cite magazine |title=Woolworths Top 30 Computer Software – November 1987|magazine=Computer and Video Games|issue=74|publisher=EMAP|date=15 November 1987|page=43|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=1525&page=43|access-date=8 December 2021}}</ref> During the same year, [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]] ported it to the [[Atari ST]] and the Commodore 64 (different compared to U.S. Gold's version).

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' on their December 15, 1985 issue as being the fourth most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=274|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 December 1985|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', reviewing the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST versions, called the game "quite an accurate and splendid conversion", particularly the Atari ST version. The magazine praised the game's playability, but criticized its difficulty and sound effects.<ref name=CaVG>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-and-videogames-073/ComputerAndVideoGames_073_Nov_1987#page/n26/mode/1up/|title=Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|work=[[Computer and Video Games]]|date=November 1987|access-date=August 16, 2016|page=27}}</ref>

Jonathan Sutyak of [[AllGame]], who gave the Commodore 64 version one and a half stars out of five, called the game a "major disappointment". Sutyak criticized the gameplay and "terrible" controls, and wrote: "Graphically the game is a mess. Most of the game is brown and gray, very unappealing. [...] Sounds are not great either but they are a bit better than the graphics. Theme music plays in the background which is the best part of the game. Most of the sound effects are not sharp and not enough of them exist. ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' is a bad game all the way around. It looks bad, has bad controls, and is way too short."<ref name=AGR>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=3832&tab=review|title=Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Commodore 64) - Review|last=Sutyak|first=Jonathan|work=AllGame|access-date=August 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117075548/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=3832&tab=review|archive-date=November 17, 2014}}</ref>
