'''''Marsport''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[computer game]] that was released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] [[home computer]]s in 1985. It was published by [[Gargoyle Games]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and Dro Soft in [[Spain]]. ''Marsport'' was intended to be the first part of a trilogy called "The Siege of Earth" but parts two and three (''Fornax'' and	''Gath'') were not forthcoming. Because of this, it is often regarded as being part of an unofficial trilogy alongside ''[[Tir Na Nog (game)|Tir Na Nog]]'' and ''[[Dun Darach]]'' (both of which are part of the same official series) due to its having very similar gameplay to these titles. ''Marsport'' also has similarities to the later Gargoyle game ''[[Heavy on the Magick]]''.

==Story==
The year is 2494. For seventy years, the Earth has been under siege by the insectoid Sept. Since the siege began, the Sept have been kept at bay by a huge Force Sphere which surrounds the Earth and the Moon. However, the Sept are on the verge of discovering how to breach the Sphere unless it can be strengthened according to the formulae contained in the original plans. Unfortunately, these plans are concealed somewhere in the Martian city of Marsport, now Sept-occupied and booby-trapped by the city's M-Central computer. One man, Commander John Marsh, has been sent to retrieve the plans in the belief that a determined man can sometimes achieve more than an army.
