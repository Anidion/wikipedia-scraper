'''''Moebius: The Orb of Celestial Harmony''''' is a [[video game]] produced by [[Origin Systems]] and designed by Greg Malone.<ref name=giantlist/> It was originally released in 1985 for the [[Apple II]]. Versions were also released for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Macintosh]], and [[MS-DOS]]. The game is primarily a top-down view [[tile-based game|tile-based]] [[role-playing video game]], but it has action-based combat sequences which use a side view, roughly similar to games such as ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]''.

Origin Systems produced a sequel to the game, ''[[Windwalker (video game)|Windwalker]]''.

==Gameplay==
The player's objective, as a [[Apprenticeship|disciple]] of the [[Headmaster]], is to recover the [[Sphere|Orb]] of Celestial Harmony from the disciple-turned-badguy Kaimen. To do that, the player must train his body and soul in the best tradition of Chinese warriors: to "walk the path of Moebius the Windwalker." The action takes place on the four Elemental planes of [[Earth]], [[Water]], [[Air]] and [[Fire]], which the player must traverse in order to recover the Orb. Although gameplay is similar to standard RPGs, there are some differences: in addition to familiar character statistics such as [[dexterity]], the players also has [[karma]], a crucial attribute that goes up or down constantly depending on his deeds. Frighten a citizen with a sword, and the karma will drop; defeat monsters in battle, and it will rise. Combat is also played in a 2D side-scrolling view similar to [[fighting game]]s, having a wide range of attacks to use, even including [[Shuriken#Popular culture|shurikens]] and fireballs if the character is experienced enough.

==Reception==
''[[Compute!|COMPUTE!]]'' called ''Moebius'' "yet another program worth raving about" from Origin, and a worthy followup to ''[[Ultima IV]]''. It stated that the game had excellent graphics, "challenging and functional" arcade combat, and "many hours of enjoyment" from the puzzles.<ref name="trunzo198607">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-07-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_074_1986_Jul#page/n63/mode/2up | title=Moebius: The Orb Of Celestial Harmony For Apple | work=Compute! | date=July 1986 | accessdate=8 November 2013 | author=Trunzo, James V. | pages=62}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in 1986 that the game was "sort of an outgrowth or continuation of the best parts of Ultima with special emphasis on graphic detail ...

Steve Fuelleman reviewed ''Moebius: The Orb of Celestial Harmony'' in ''[[The Space Gamer|Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]'' No. 78.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Fuelleman |first=Steve |date=April–May 1987 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer|Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]|publisher=[[Diverse Talents, Incorporated]]|issue=78|pages=41}}</ref> Fuelleman commented that "Overall, the game is excellent, in spite of the graphic animation and frustrations of play, or perhaps because of them. They lend an interesting flavor to the game and keep you on your toes. The graphics are good, and the animation doesn't overshadow the plot. This one is a gem, and the flaws only add a little more fire to it. Not only a must have, but probably one you would like."<ref name="SG"/>
