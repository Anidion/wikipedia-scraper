"'''Ghetto Blaster'''" is a [[computer game]] that was released for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1985. It was developed by two former employees of Taskset, a software house, Tony Gibson and Mark Harrison.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Taskset |url=http://www.the-commodore-zone.com/articlelive/articles/3/4/Taskset/Page4.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Ghettoblaster (1985) |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/17105/ghettoblaster/ |access-date=2023-04-03 |website=MobyGames |language=en}}</ref>

==Gameplay and Story==
Rockin' Rodney is the [[player character]] and protagonist of the game,<ref>{{Cite web |last=kindarspirit |date=2004-04-30 |title=Walkthrough |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/30/ghetto-blaster-walkthrough-509880 |access-date=2022-05-09 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref> and has been employed as a [[courier]] for the fictional [[record company]] ''Interdisc''. The player must find and collect batteries for their [[ghetto blaster]] and afterwards locate ten [[cassette tape]] [[Demo (music)|demos]] of [[dance music]]. When this is done, the player must get people to dance to the tape demos by listening to them on their boombox. The main aim of the game is to deliver the tapes to ''Interdisc''<ref name="zzap">[http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=003&page=062&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap&check=1 http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=003&page=062&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap]</ref> by navigating through a [[maze]] of streets, alleyways, and [[cul-de-sacs]], which are laid out and populated by various characters.

The street names are named after famous songs (e.g. "[[Blackberry Way]]", "[[Desolation Row]]"). A map is provided in the cassette inlay,<ref name="zzap"/> and some of the characters reference others.

==Reception==
''[[Zzap!64]]'' praised the game's music and gameplay, but criticized its repetitive nature and lack of a real scoring system, which removes any potential [[replay value]].<ref name="zzap"/>
