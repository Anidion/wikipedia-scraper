'''''The Way of the Exploding Fist''''' is a 1985 [[fighting game]] based on [[Japanese martial arts]] developed by [[Beam Software]], by a team consisting of Gregg Barnett, Bruce Bayley, Neil Brennan and David Johnston. Originally developed on the [[Commodore 64]] and published in June 1985 by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]], ports were made for [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Acorn Electron]] and [[Commodore 16]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:C64_explodingfist.png|left|thumb|256px|Commodore 64 gameplay]]
The game has various backgrounds that change as the player progresses through the levels: inside a [[dojo]], an outdoor field with snowy mountains and volcanoes, a [[Buddha statue]], or some [[pagoda]]s.

The player takes part in a series of one-on-one [[karate]] matches, all overseen by a wise old expert who appears in the background. Once the player defeats an opponent they move up to the next stage and a more difficult adversary. Fights are not won using the [[Health (gaming)|energy-bar]] style found in modern fighting games; instead, the player needed to get two complete [[yin-yang]]s. Any move that connected with the opponent would end the round; a loosely timed or borderline kick or punch would obtain half a yin-yang icon, while a well-executed move would obtain a full icon. Two complete icons ended the bout and progressed to the next level.

This system of scoring, known as shobu nihon [[kumite]], is used in real life in many traditional styles of karate. A half yin-yang represents a ''waza-ari'' (a committed but not decisive technique) and a full yin-yang represents an ''ippon'' score (full point, decisive finishing blow).

The game control is via joystick or direction keys and a "fire" key. 18 different movements can be made, including jumping kick, roundhouse kick and a variety of punches and kicks, high and low. The game features a variety of backgrounds against which the fighting takes place. After completing a number of progressively harder stages, the player is charged at by a bull in a bonus round. The player must knock the bull out with a single hit. The bonus round mirrors the feats of [[Mas Oyama]], a karate expert who purportedly killed bulls with a single strike. This bonus round was not present in the ZX Spectrum version and some of the early Commodore 64 versions.

==Production==
Before creating ''The Way of the Exploding Fist'', designer Gregg Barnett converted ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[Sherlock (video game)|Sherlock]]'', two adventures from Beam Software, to the Commodore 64.<ref name="yourcomputerbarnett">''[[iarchive:your-computer-magazine-1985-08/page/n41|First Fist, Then...]]'' In: ''[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer.]]'' August 1985, p. 42.</ref> It was one of the first games to borrow heavily from the [[Data East]] arcade game ''[[Karate Champ]]'', which was released the previous year. The Commodore 64 version uses over 600 sprite images to animate the player's movements.<ref name="zzap64review">{{cite journal|date=11 July 1985|title=Way of the Exploding Fist|url=https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-004/page/n29/mode/2up|journal=[[Zzap!64]]|issue=4 (August 1985)|pages=30–32}}</ref> Karate champion [[Geoff Thompson (karateka)|Jeoffrey Thompson]] was signed<ref>Jeoff Thompson: ''Karate: The Pursuit of Excellence.''

In: The Guardian, January 16th 1986. – In his article Lennox discusses how, spawned by [[Daley Thompson's Decathlon]], a number of British sportsmen have endorsed and lend their name to computer games. Among them are [[Frank Bruno's Boxing]], [[Barry McGuigan World Championship Boxing]], [[Ian Botham]], [[Steve Davis]] and [[Bobby Charlton]]</ref> A [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version was developed by [[Beam Software]] but it was never released.

The game's soundtrack was written by Neil Brennan and it is based on the 1952 orchestral piece [[Dance of the Yao People]]. It has been praised for the excellent atmosphere it provided and was one reason behind the popularity of the game.

==Sequels==
There were three sequels: ''Fist II: The Legend Continues'' (1986) and ''Fist II: The Tournament'' (1987) and ''Exploding Fist +''. Of these three, ''Fist II: The Legend Continues'' is not a fighting game involving player-versus-player, but a scrolling [[adventure game]] with one-on-one fighting elements. ''Exploding Fist +'', on the other hand, returns to the style of the first game. It features combat with three characters, an idea followed from ''[[International Karate +]]'', though in this case it is possible for players to control the three characters simultaneously.
