'''''Norway 1985''''' is a [[computer wargame]] published in October 1985 by [[Strategic Simulations]]. Developed by [[Roger Keating]], it was the fourth in the "When Superpowers Collide" series.

==Summary==
The game simulates [[NATO|NATO forces]] in [[Norway]] during the summer of 1985. The player may choose to play either the [[NATO]] or Soviet forces, and can play in turns against another human component or against the computer.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1986 stated that ''Norway 1985''{{'}}s simplified rules compared to its predecessors accurately reflected the changes of arctic combat, and made it the most suitable for those new to the series. The magazine concluded that although those familiar with the older games "will have to adjust your expectations ... If you can do this, you will find a good game here".<ref name="selover19860607">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&pub=2&id=29 | title=Norway 1985 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=Junâ€“Jul 1986 | accessdate=28 July 2014 | author=Selover, Jay | pages=38}}</ref>
