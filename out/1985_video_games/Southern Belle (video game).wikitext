'''''Southern Belle''''' is a [[train simulation]] [[video game]] published by [[Hewson Consultants]] in 1985. ''Southern Belle'' was unique at the time of release in that it was the first 3D [[steam train]] [[simulator]] available for home computers.{{fact|date=June 2018}} The game allows the user to take over the fireman and/or driver duties on a [[LSWR N15 Class|King Arthur class]] passenger [[steam locomotive]] on the [[Brighton Main Line|London to Brighton line]].

It was programmed by Mike Male, who teamed up with friend and railway buff Bob Hillyer.<ref name=sincuser>[http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/043/htsquad.htm "The Hewson Express"] article from ''Sinclair User'' issue 43, October 1985; retrieved from Sinclair User Magazine Online</ref>

==Gameplay==
The aim of the game is to complete a simulated journey of the ''[[Brighton Belle|Southern Belle]]'' steam [[passenger train]] from [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] to [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]] while keeping to speed regulations, being careful not to derail when going around curves and completing the journey on time. There are various options available including a demonstration run, where the computer takes control of the locomotive, and a number of challenges such as beating the real record breaking run for that line, set on 26 July 1903 (at 48 minutes 41 seconds).

==Graphics==
The graphics were "vector-style", but because of the limitations of the ZX Spectrum and such computers, the graphics were minimal. The framerate was very slow, updating only once per second. This was particularly notable when playing in "Fast" mode, where gameplay could be sped up x5 by pressing the "A" key. Also, the main gameplay screen lacked colour, with most versions being in monochrome. However, the ZX Spectrum version did include a "red" fire. Additionally, there were sections of line where there were no buildings visible in the foreground, leading to criticisms that the game looked as though the countryside had been hit by a nuclear bomb.

The game's demo mode was a high speed run, in homage to [[British Transport Films]]'s classic ''London to Brighton in 4 Minutes''. The next station/tunnel's name appeared as a totem sign at the top of the screen (just after [[Gatwick Airport railway station|Gatwick Racecourse]], it changed to [[Three Bridges railway station|Three Bridges]] and the lineside features passed in that section included three bridges).

==Sequels==
''Belle'' was followed up in 1987 with ''[[Evening Star (video game)|Evening Star]]'', also published by Hewson and programmed by Mike Male and Bob Hillyer.<ref>{{WoS game|id=0001673|name=Evening Star}}</ref> ''Star'' is set on the old [[Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway|Somerset & Dorset line]] between [[Bath Green Park railway station|Bath]] and [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]].

==Reception==
''[[Your Sinclair]]'' reviewed ''Southern Belle''<ref><!--[http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr19/yr19_41.htm]]-->{{cite journal|title= ''Southern Belle'' review|journal=Your Spectrum|issue=19| date=October 1985 }};<!--retrieved from the Your Spectrum Unofficial Archive--></ref> in October 1985, giving an average rating of 5 out of 10. The reviewers felt that ''Belle'' made a welcome change from space games and had intuitive controls, but was ultimately lacking in excitement.

''[[Electron User]]'' reviewed ''Southern Belle'' in May 1986,<ref><!--[http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eu/revs/hewson/r-sout.html review] Dead link date=February 2009 -->{{cite journal|title=''Southern Belle''|journal=Electron User|volume=3|issue=8| date=May 1986 }}<!--; retrieved from ''Acorn Electron World''--></ref> giving an overall score of 7 out of 10. The reviewer praised the title's originality but questioned if it could hold the attention of gamers who were not railway enthusiasts.

''[[Zzap!64]]'' reviewed ''Southern Belle'' in July 1986,<ref><!-- [http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=015&page=042&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap&check=1]-->{{cite journal|title=''Southern Belle'' review|journal=Zzap!64|date=July 1986}}<!--; retrieved from ''zzap64.co.uk''--></ref> giving an overall score of 88%. The reviewer concluded: ''"A superb simulation of a dull subject"''.
