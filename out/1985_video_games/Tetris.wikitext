'''''Tetris''''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Тетрис}}{{efn|Pronounced {{IPA-ru|ˈtʲetrʲɪs|}} or {{IPA-ru|ˈtetrʲɪs|}}}}) is a [[puzzle video game]] created in 1985 <!-- Please consult the talk page of the article before changing the date. -->by [[Alexey Pajitnov]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[software engineer]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tetris {{!}} video game {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.Britannica.com/topic/Tetris |access-date=2023-04-18 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> It has been published by several companies for multiple platforms, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by [[Nintendo]], in 1996 the rights reverted to Pajitnov, who co-founded [[the Tetris Company]] with [[Henk Rogers]] to manage licensing.

In ''Tetris'', players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces ([[tetromino]]es), which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the uncleared lines reach the top of the playing field. The longer the player can delay this outcome, the higher their score will be. In [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games, players must last longer than their opponents; in certain versions, players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a significant number of lines. Some versions add variations on the rules, such as three-dimensional displays or a system for reserving pieces.

Built on simple rules, ''Tetris'' established itself as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the greatest video games ever made]]. By December 2011, it had sold 202{{nbsp}}million copies—approximately 70{{nbsp}}million physical units and 132{{nbsp}}million paid [[mobile game]] downloads—making it one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchises]]. The [[Tetris (Game Boy video game)|Game Boy version]] is [[List of best-selling video games|one of the best-selling games of all time]], with more than 35&nbsp;million copies sold. ''Tetris'' is available on [[List of Tetris variants|over 65 platforms]], setting a [[Guinness World Records|''Guinness'' world record]] for the most ported video game. ''Tetris'' is rooted within popular culture and its popularity extends beyond the sphere of video games; imagery from the game has influenced architecture, music, and [[cosplay]]. The game also has been the subject of various research studies that have analyzed its theoretical complexity and have shown its effect on the human brain following a session, in particular the [[Tetris effect|''Tetris'' effect]].

==Gameplay==
''Tetris'' is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called "[[tetromino]]es", descend from the top of the field.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=377}} During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it.<ref name="AboutTetris">{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/about-us |title=About ''Tetris'' |publisher=The Tetris Company |access-date=November 14, 2019 |archive-date=November 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105215554/https://tetris.com/about-us |url-status=live }}</ref> The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them, in most versions.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |title=Tetris |type=Game Boy instruction booklet}}</ref>{{Rp|page=4}}<ref>{{Cite book |last= |title=Tetris DS |pages=6 |type=Instruction booklet}}</ref> The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many complete horizontal lines of blocks as possible. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank.<ref name="AboutTetris"/> Completing lines grants points, and accumulating a certain number of points or cleared lines moves the player up a level, which increases the number of points granted per completed line.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=16}}

In most versions, the speed of the falling pieces increases with each level, leaving the player with less time to think about the placement.<ref name="AboutTetris" /> The player can clear multiple lines at once, which can earn bonus points in some versions.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=377}} It is possible to complete up to four lines simultaneously with the use of the I-shaped tetromino; this move is called a "Tetris", and along with the fact that its seven different pieces (tetrominoes) are made up of 4 squares, is the basis of the game's title.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=16}}

If the player cannot make the blocks disappear quickly enough, the field will start to fill; when the pieces reach the top of the field and prevent the arrival of additional pieces, the game ends.<ref name="AboutTetris" /> At the end of each game, the player receives a score based on the number of lines that have been completed.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=16}} The game never ends with the player's victory, as the player can complete only as many lines as possible before an inevitable loss.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=377}}

Since 1996, the Tetris Company has internally defined specifications and guidelines to which publishers must adhere to be granted a license to ''Tetris''. The contents of these guidelines establish elements such as the correspondence of buttons and actions, the size of the field of play, and the system of rotation.<ref name="HistoryOfTetris">{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/history-of-tetris |title=History of ''Tetris'' |publisher=The Tetris Company |access-date=November 18, 2019 |archive-date=October 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191011070325/https://tetris.com/history-of-tetris |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="tftt">{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/interview/11267/tetris-from-the-top-an-interview-with-henk-rogers |title=''Tetris'' from the Top: An Interview with Henk Rogers |author=Metts, Jonathan |website=Nintendo World Report |date=April 6, 2006 |access-date=April 28, 2007 |archive-date=March 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311043518/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/interview/11267/tetris-from-the-top-an-interview-with-henk-rogers |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Game pieces===
[[File:Tetrominoes IJLO STZ Worlds.svg|thumb|All seven [[tetrominoes]] using the standard color scheme]]
The pieces on which the game of ''Tetris'' is based around are called "tetrominoes". Pajitnov's original version for the [[Electronika 60]] computer used green brackets to represent the blocks that make up tetrominoes.<ref name="vadim"/> Versions of ''Tetris'' on the original Game Boy/Game Boy Color and on most dedicated handheld games use black-and-white or [[grayscale]] graphics, but most popular versions use a separate color for each distinct shape. Prior to the Tetris Company's standardization in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from implementation to implementation.

===Scoring===
The scoring formula for the majority of ''Tetris'' products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear in ''Tetris Zone'' is worth 100 points, clearing four lines at once (known as a ''Tetris'') is worth 800, while each subsequent back-to-back ''Tetris'' is worth 1,200.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tetris Zone Manual |url=http://zone.tetris.com/page/manual |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023148/http://zone.tetris.com/page/manual |archive-date=February 6, 2009 |website=Tetris Zone}}</ref> In conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which reward multiple line clears in quick succession. The exact conditions for triggering combos, and the amount of importance assigned to them, vary from game to game.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Nearly all ''Tetris'' games allow the player to press a button to increase the speed of the current piece's descent or cause the piece to drop and lock into place immediately, known as a "soft drop" and a "hard drop", respectively. While performing a soft drop, the player can also stop the piece's increased speed by releasing the button before the piece settles into place. Some games allow only one of either soft drop or hard drop; others have separate buttons for each. Many games award a number of points based on the height that the piece fell before locking, so using the hard drop generally awards more points.

===Infinite game question===
In 1992, John Brzustowski at the [[University of British Columbia]] wrote a thesis reflecting on the question of whether or not one could theoretically play ''Tetris'' forever.<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Brzustowski |first=John |title=Can you win at Tetris? |date=March 1992 |degree=Master of Science |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/831/1.0079748 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220318064558/https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/831/1.0079748 |archive-date=March 18, 2022 |access-date=October 16, 2013 |url-status=live}} [https://archive.org/details/20220318_20220318_0433 Alt URL]</ref> He reached the conclusion that the game is statistically doomed to end. If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S and Z tetrominoes, the naïve gravity used by the standard game eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board. The holes will necessarily stack to the top and, ultimately, end the game. If the pieces are distributed randomly, this sequence will eventually occur. Thus, if a game with, for example, an ideal, uniform, uncorrelated [[Random number generation|random number generator]] is played long enough, any player will [[almost surely]] top out.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Burgiel |first=Heidi |date=January 7, 1996 |title=Discussion of the Tetris Applet |url=http://www.math.uic.edu/~burgiel/Tetris/explanation.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209110731/http://www.math.uic.edu/~burgiel/Tetris/explanation.html |archive-date=December 9, 2006 |access-date=February 25, 2007 |website=Tetris Research Page}}</ref><ref>Heidi Burgiel.

Modern versions of ''Tetris'' released after 2001 use a "bag-style" randomizer that guarantees players will never receive more than four S and Z pieces in a row by shuffling tetrominoes of all types for each seven pieces.<ref name="Ars_interview">{{Cite web |date=April 26, 2023 |title=Unsolved Tetris Mysteries With Creator Alexy Pajitnov & Designer Henk Rogers |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhkkyXydNI |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |type=Video |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>{{Sup|5:20}} This is one of the "Indispensable Rules" enforced by the ''Tetris Guideline'' that all officially licensed ''Tetris'' games must follow.<ref name="tftt"/>

=== Easy spin dispute ===
"Easy spin", or "infinite spin",<ref name="gs">{{cite web |last=Davis |first=Ryan |date=September 5, 2001 |title=Tetris Worlds for Game Boy Advance Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028130427/http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html |archive-date=October 28, 2011 |access-date=November 22, 2012 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> is a feature in some ''Tetris'' games where a tetromino stops falling for a moment after left or right movement or rotation, effectively allowing the player to suspend the piece while deciding where to place it. The mechanic was introduced in 1999's ''[[The Next Tetris]]''{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} and drew criticism in reviews of 2001's ''[[Tetris Worlds]]''.<ref name="gs"/>

This feature has been implemented into [[the Tetris Company]]'s official guideline.<ref name="tftt"/> This type of play differs from traditional ''Tetris'' because it takes away the pressure of higher-level speed. Some reviewers<ref name="gsrev">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html|title=Tetris Worlds for PlayStation 2 Review|access-date=November 12, 2008|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 19, 2002|author1=[[Jeff Gerstmann]]|author2=Ryan Davis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130070533/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html|archive-date=January 30, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> went so far as to say that this mechanism broke the game.<!-- "broke the game" is a colloquialism and should be replaced, perhaps by a quote from a review --> The goal in ''Tetris Worlds'' is to complete a certain number of lines as fast as possible, so the ability to hold off a piece's placement will not make achieving that goal any faster. Later, GameSpot received "easy spin" more openly, saying that "the infinite spin issue honestly really affects only a few of the single-player gameplay modes in ''Tetris DS'', because any competitive mode requires you to lay down pieces as quickly as humanly possible".<ref>{{cite web |last=Davis |first=Ryan |date=March 20, 2006 |title=Tetris DS Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tetris-ds-review/1900-6146173/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805040528/http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/tetris/review.html |archive-date=August 5, 2011 |access-date=November 22, 2012 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref>

[[Henk Rogers]] told ''Nintendo World Report'' that infinite spin was an intentional part of the game design, allowing novice players to expend some of their available scoring time to decide on the best placement of a piece. He observed that "gratuitous spinning" does not occur in competitive play, as expert players do not require much time to think about where a piece should be placed. A limitation has been placed on infinite lock delay in later games of the franchise, where after a certain amount of rotations and movements, the piece will instantly lock itself. This is defaulted to 15 such actions.<ref name="tftt" />

In 1979, [[Alexey Pajitnov]] joined the Computer Center of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] as a [[speech recognition]] researcher. While he was tasked with testing the capabilities of new hardware, his ambition was to use computers to make people happy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Ichbiah |first=Daniel |title=La Saga des Jeux Vidéo |publisher=Pix'N Love Editions |year=1997 |isbn=2266087630 |edition=1st |language=fr}}</ref>{{Rp|page=85}} Pajitnov developed several puzzle games on the institute's computer, an [[Electronika 60]], a scarce resource at the time due in part to [[CoCom]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last1=Sheff |first1=David |title=Game Over: Press Start to Continue |last2=Eddy |first2=Andy |publisher=Cyberactive Media Group |year=1999 |isbn=0966961706 |edition=1st}}</ref>{{Rp|page=298}}<ref name="Ars_interview" />{{Sup|1:50}} For Pajitnov, "games allow people to get to know each other better and act as revealers of things you might not normally notice, such as their way of thinking".<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=85}}

===Acquisition of rights by Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte===
Pajitnov wanted to export ''Tetris'', but had no knowledge of the business world. His superiors in the Academy were not necessarily happy with the success of the game, since they had not intended such a creation from the research team.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=87}} Furthermore, [[copyright law of the Soviet Union]] created a state monopoly on import and export of copyrighted works, and the Soviet researchers were not allowed to sell their creations.<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|page=301}}<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=10 min}} Pajitnov asked his supervisor Victor Brjabrin, who had knowledge of the world outside the Soviet Union, to help him publish ''Tetris''. Pajitnov offered to transfer the rights of the game to the Academy, and was delighted to receive a non-compulsory remuneration from Brjabrin through this deal.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=88}}

In 1986, Brjabrin sent a copy of ''Tetris'' to Hungarian game publisher [[Appaloosa Interactive|Novotrade]].<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=88}} From there, copies of the game began circulating via [[floppy disk]]s throughout Hungary and as far as [[Poland]].<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=89}} Robert Stein, an international software salesman for the London-based firm Andromeda Software, saw the game's commercial potential during a visit to Hungary in June 1986.<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|page=302}}<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=11 min}} After an indifferent response from the Academy,<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|page=|location=12 min}} Stein contacted Pajitnov and Brjabrin by fax to obtain the license rights.<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=11 min}} The researchers expressed interest in forming an agreement with Stein via fax, but they were unaware that this fax communication could be considered a legal contract in the Western world;{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=12 min.}} Stein began to approach other companies to produce the game.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|pages=89–90}}

Stein approached publishers at the 1987 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas]]. Gary Carlston, co-founder of [[Broderbund]], retrieved a copy and brought it to California. Despite enthusiasm amongst its employees, Broderbund remained skeptical because of the game's Soviet origins. Likewise, [[Mastertronic]] co-founder Martin Alper declared that "no Soviet product will ever work in the Western world".<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=90}}

Stein ultimately signed two agreements: he sold the European rights to the publisher [[Mirrorsoft]]<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=90}}{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=479}} and the American rights to sister company [[Spectrum HoloByte]].{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=294,479}} The latter obtained the rights after a visit to Mirrorsoft by Spectrum HoloByte president Phil Adam in which he played ''Tetris'' for two hours.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=90}}<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=15 min}} At that time, Stein had not yet signed a contract with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=479}} Nevertheless, he sold the rights to the two companies for £3,000 and a royalty of 7.5 to 15% on sales.<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|page=304}}

Before releasing ''Tetris'' in the United States, Spectrum HoloByte CEO [[Gilman Louie]] asked for an overhaul of the game's graphics and music.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=90}} The Soviet spirit was preserved, with fields illustrating Russian parks and buildings as well as melodies anchored in Russian folklore of the time. The company's goal was to make people want to buy a Russian product. The game came complete with a red package and Cyrillic text, an unusual approach on the other side of the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=16 min}} The Spectrum HoloByte version was released for the DOS PCs in January 1988, with other platforms following over the next year.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=294}}<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=91}}

Mirrorsoft ported ''Tetris'' to platforms including the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. ''Tetris'' was a commercial success in Europe and the United States: Mirrorsoft sold tens of thousands of copies in two months,<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=91}} and Spectrum HoloByte sold over 100,000 units in the space of a year.<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=18 min}} According to Spectrum HoloByte, the average ''Tetris'' player was between 25 and 45 years old and was a manager or engineer. At the [[Software and Information Industry Association|Software Publishers Association]]'s Excellence in Software Awards ceremony in March 1988, ''Tetris'' won Best Entertainment Software, Best Original Game, Best Strategy Program, and Best Consumer Software.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=91}}

Stein was faced with a problem: the only document certifying a license fee was the fax from Pajitnov and Brjabrin, meaning that Stein sold the license for a game he did not yet own. Stein contacted Pajitnov and asked him for a contract for the rights.

===Acquisition of rights by Nintendo and legal battle===
[[File:Tetris on Game Boy.jpg|thumb|upright|Tetris on a Nintendo [[Game&nbsp;Boy]]]]
In 1988, Spectrum HoloByte sold the Japanese rights to its computer games to [[Bullet-Proof Software]]'s [[Henk Rogers]], who was searching for games for the Japanese market.<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=22 min}} Mirrorsoft sold arcade rights to [[Atari Games]] subsidiary [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]], which then sold the Japanese arcade rights to [[Sega]] and the console rights to BPS, which published versions for Japanese computers, including the [[MSX2]], [[PC-88]] and [[X68000]], along with a console port for the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom), known outside Japan as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name=":3"/>{{Rp|page=480}} The Japanese port was written in [[C (programming language)|C]]<ref name="Ars_interview" />{{Sup|2:55}} and in [[6502 assembly]] language for Nintendo.<ref name="Ars_interview" />{{Sup|3:05}}

At this point, almost a dozen companies believed they held the ''Tetris'' rights, with Stein retaining rights for home computer versions.<ref name=":3"/>{{Rp|page=480}} The Soviet Union's Elorg was still unaware of the deals Stein had negotiated, which did not bring money to them. ''Tetris'' was a commercial success in North America, Europe and Asia.<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=22 min}}

The same year, [[Nintendo]] was preparing to launch its first portable console, the [[Game Boy]].

Rogers arrived at the Elorg offices uninvited, while Stein and Mirrorsoft manager [[Kevin Maxwell]] made an appointment the same day without consulting each other.<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=29 min}} During the discussions, Rogers explained that he wanted to obtain the rights to ''Tetris'' for the Game Boy.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=95}} After quickly obtaining an agreement with Elorg president Nikolai Belikov,<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|page=316}} Rogers showed Belikov a Famicom ''Tetris'' cartridge.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=94}} Belikov was surprised, as he believed at the time that the rights to ''Tetris'' were only signed for computer systems.<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=31 min}}

The present parties accused Rogers of illegal publication, but Rogers defended himself by explaining that he had obtained the rights via Atari Games, which had itself signed an agreement with Stein.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=94}} Belikov then realized the complex path that the license had followed within four years because of Stein's contracts, and he constructed a strategy to regain possession of the rights and obtain better commercial agreements. At that point, Elorg was faced with three different companies seeking to buy the rights.<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=35 min}}

During this time, Rogers befriended Pajitnov over a game of [[Go (game)|Go]]. Pajitnov supported Rogers throughout the discussions, to the detriment of Maxwell, who had come to secure the console rights for Mirrorsoft.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=93}} Belikov proposed to Rogers that Stein's rights would be cancelled and Nintendo would be granted the game rights for both home and handheld consoles.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=94}} Rogers flew to the United States to convince Nintendo's American branch to sign up for the rights.

Elorg then sent an updated contract to Stein.

In March 1989, Nintendo sent a [[cease and desist]] to Atari Games concerning production of the NES version of ''Tetris''.<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=47 min}} Atari Games contacted Mirrorsoft and were assured that they still retained the rights. Nintendo  maintained its position. In response, Mirrorsoft owner [[Robert Maxwell]] pressured Soviet Union leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to cancel the contract between Elorg and Nintendo.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=95}} Despite the threats to Belikov, Elorg refused to give in and highlighted the financial advantages of their contract compared to those signed with Stein and Mirrorsoft.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=95}}<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=45 min}}

On June 15, 1989, Nintendo and Atari Games began a legal battle in the courts of San Francisco. Atari Games sought to prove that the NES was a computer, as indicated by its Japanese name "Famicom", an abbreviation of "Family Computer". In this case, the initial license would authorize Atari Games to release the game. The central argument of Atari Games was that the Famicom was designed to be convertible into a computer via its extension port. This argument was not accepted, and Pajitnov stressed that the initial contract only concerned computers and no other machine.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=96}}

Nintendo brought Belikov to testify on its behalf.<ref name=":4" />{{Rp|location=48 min}} Judge [[Fern M. Smith]] declared that Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte never received explicit authorization for marketing on consoles, and, on June 21, 1989, ruled in Nintendo's favor, granting them a preliminary injunction against Atari Games in the process.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=96}} The next day, Atari Games withdrew its NES version from sale, and thousands of cartridges remained unsold in the company's warehouses.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=From Russia with Litigation |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1997 |page=42}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |year=2002 |title=The Wish List |journal=Edge Presents Retro}}</ref>

Through the legal history of the license, Pajitnov gained a reputation in the West. He was regularly invited by journalists and publishers, through which he discovered that ''Tetris'' had sold millions of copies, from which he had not made any money. He took pride in the game, which he considered "an electronic ambassador of benevolence".<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=96}}

In January 1990, Pajitnov was invited by Spectrum HoloByte to the Consumer Electronics Show, and he was immersed in American life for the first time.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=97}} After a period of adaptation, he explored American culture in several cities, including Las Vegas, San Francisco, New York City and Boston. He engaged in interviews with several hosts, including the directors of Nintendo of America.<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|page=347}} He marveled at the freedom and the advantages of Western society, and, upon returning to the Soviet Union, he spoke often of his travels to his colleagues.

In 1991, Pajitnov and Pokhilko emigrated to the United States.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=97}} Pajitnov moved to Seattle, where he produced games for Spectrum HoloByte. In April 1996, as agreed with the Academy ten years earlier and following an agreement with Rogers, the rights to ''Tetris'' reverted to Pajitnov.<ref name="HenkRogersStory">{{cite web |url=https://www.sramanamitra.com/2009/09/20/the-story-of-tetris-henk-rogers-part-5/ |title=The Story of ''Tetris'': Henk Rogers (Part 5) |website=Sramana Mitra |date=September 20, 2009 |access-date=April 9, 2020 |archive-date=April 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417104637/https://www.sramanamitra.com/2009/09/20/the-story-of-tetris-henk-rogers-part-5/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Pajitnov and Rogers founded [[the Tetris Company]] in June 1996 to manage the rights on all platforms, the previous agreements having expired.

''Tetris'' has been released on a multitude of platforms since the creation of the original version on the [[Electronika 60]]. The game is available on most game consoles and is playable on personal computers, smartphones and [[iPod]]s. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' recognized ''Tetris'' as the most ported video game in history, with over 200 variants having appeared on over 65 different platforms as of October 2010.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 1, 2010 |title=Most ported computer game |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/most-ported-computer-game/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223258/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/most-ported-computer-game/ |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |access-date=June 7, 2013 |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]}}</ref>  By 2017 this number had increased to 220 official variants.<ref>{{cite web|title=Most variants of a videogame|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/86503-most-official-and-unofficial-variants-in-a-videogame|website=Guinness World Records}}</ref>

Since the 2000s, internet versions of the game have been developed. Commercial versions not approved by the Tetris Company tend to be purged due to company policy.<ref name="iphonePurge" /><ref name="androidPurge" /> The most famous online version, ''[[Tetris Friends]]'' by [[Tetris Online, Inc.]], had attracted over a million registered users.<ref name="TetrisFriendsMillion">{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/Tetris-Friends-Online-Games-Hits-1-Million-Milestone-Launches-Tetris-Arena-1167945.htm |title=''Tetris Friends'' Online Games Hits 1 Million Milestone, Launches ''Tetris Arena'' |last=Musselman |first=Katie |date=April 13, 2010 |website=Marketwire |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150402000000/http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/Tetris-Friends-Online-Games-Hits-1-Million-Milestone-Launches-Tetris-Arena-1167945.htm |archive-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref> Tetris Online had also developed versions for console-based digital download services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tetrisonline.com/games/tetris_party_dsi.php |title=''Tetris Party Live'' |website=Tetris Online |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110609000000/http://www.tetrisonline.com/games/tetris_party_dsi.php |archive-date=June 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tetrisonline.com/games/tetris_splash_xbla.php |title=''Tetris Splash'' |website=Tetris Online |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110528000000/http://www.tetrisonline.com/games/tetris_splash_xbla.php |archive-date=May 28, 2011}}</ref> Because of its popularity and simplicity of development, ''Tetris'' is often used as a [[Hello world program|hello world]] project for programmers coding for a new system or programming language.

Within official franchise installments, each version has made improvements to accommodate advancing technology and the goal to provide a more complete game. Developers are given freedom to add new modes of play and revisit the concept from different angles. Some concepts developed on official versions have been integrated into the ''Tetris'' guidelines in order to standardize future versions and allow players to migrate between different versions with little effort.<ref name="tftt"/> The IBM PC version was the most evolved from the original version, featuring a graphical interface, colored tetrominoes, running statistics for the number of tetrominoes placed, and a guide for the controls.<ref name="vadim"/>

== Computational complexity ==
In [[computer science]], it is common to analyze the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of problems, including real-life problems and games. It was proven that for the "offline" version of ''Tetris'' (the player knows the complete sequence of pieces that will be dropped, i.e. there is no hidden information) the following objectives are [[NP-complete]]:
* Maximizing the number of rows cleared while playing the given piece sequence.
* Maximizing the number of pieces placed before a loss occurs.
* Maximizing the number of simultaneous clearing of four rows.
* Minimizing the height of the highest filled grid square over the course of the sequence.

Also, it is [[Hardness of approximation|difficult to even approximately solve]] the first, second, and fourth problem. It is [[NP-hard]], given an initial gameboard and a sequence of ''p'' pieces, to approximate the first two problems to within a factor of {{nowrap|''p''<sup>1 − ''ε''</sup>}} for any constant {{nowrap|''ε'' > 0}}.
It is NP-hard to approximate the last problem within a factor of {{nowrap|2 − ''ε''}} for any constant {{nowrap|''ε'' > 0}}.

To prove NP-completeness, it was shown that there is a polynomial [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] between the [[3-partition problem]], which is also NP-complete, and the ''Tetris'' problem.<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Tetris_COCOON2003/paper.pdf|title=Tetris is Hard, Even to Approximate|last1=Demaine|first1=Erik D.|last2=Hohenberger|first2=Susan|last3=Liben-Nowell|first3=David|date=July 25–28, 2003|conference=Proceedings of the 9th International Computing and Combinatorics Conference (COCOON 2003)|conference-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105042734/http://www.cs.montana.edu/bhz/cocoon03.html|location=Big Sky, Montana|access-date=December 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613201613/http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Tetris_COCOON2003/paper.pdf|archive-date=June 13, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Music==
{{See also|Korobeiniki#Arrangements of the song|Tetris (Game Boy video game)#Music}}
The earliest versions of ''Tetris'' had no music.<ref name="Ars_interview" />{{Sup|3:10}} The 1860s Russian folk tune "[[Korobeiniki]]" first appeared in [[Spectrum Holobyte]]'s 1988 Macintosh and Apple IIGS versions of Tetris as one of the tunes that briefly plays at the start of each level.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Cross-Cultural Tetris Theme Song |url=https://www.kmfa.org/pages/3159-the-cross-cultural-tetris-theme-song |website=KMFA 89.5 {{!}} Austin's Classical Music Radio Station |access-date=12 February 2022 |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> It also appeared as the title screen music in Bullet-Proof Software's Japanese Famicom release. Nintendo's NES version does not include ''Korobeiniki''; instead it includes an arrangement of "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" from the second act of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', composed by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and arranged by [[Hirokazu Tanaka]], along with two original compositions by Tanaka. Nintendo's Game Boy version includes "Korobeiniki" as well as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s [[French Suites, BWV 812-817|French Suite No. 3 In B Minor]] (BWV 814), and an original track by Tanaka. The version included in the Super NES compilation ''[[Tetris & Dr. Mario]]'' uses arrangements of the Game Boy version's music.

"Korobeiniki" is used in most versions of the game, and has appeared in other games, albums and films that make reference to ''Tetris''. [[Doctor Spin]]'s 1992 [[Eurodance]] [[cover (music)|cover]] (under the name "[[Tetris (Doctor Spin song)|Tetris]]") reached #6 on the [[UK Singles Chart|UK singles chart]]. In the 2000s, the Tetris Company added as a prerequisite for the granting of the license that a version of "Korobeiniki" be available in the game.<ref name=guardian020609/>

The [[World War II]] Soviet folk tune "[[Katyusha (song)|Katyusha]]" also appeared in the Tengen and Bullet-Proof Software versions.

== Cognitive effects ==
{{See also|Tetris effect}}
''Tetris'' has been the subject of academic research. [[Vladimir Pokhilko]] was the first clinical psychologist to conduct experiments using ''Tetris''.<ref name="MarkWolf2012">{{cite book | author=Mark J. P.

''Tetris'' can cause the brain to involuntarily picture ''Tetris'' combinations even when the player is not playing (the [[Tetris effect|''Tetris'' effect]]), although this can occur with any computer game or situation showcasing repeated images or scenarios, such as a [[jigsaw puzzle]].

Jackie Andrade and Jon May, from [[Plymouth University]]'s Cognition Institute, and doctoral student Jessica Skorka-Brown have conducted research that shows that playing ''Tetris'' could distract from cravings and give a "quick and manageable" fix for people struggling to stick to diets, or quit smoking or drinking.<ref>{{cite news|last=GANDER|first=KASHMIRA|title=Playing Tetris could help with weight loss and smokers' cravings, psychologists claim|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/playing-tetris-could-help-with-weight-loss-and-smokers-cravings-psychologists-claim-9149045.html|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=February 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224123004/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/playing-tetris-could-help-with-weight-loss-and-smokers-cravings-psychologists-claim-9149045.html|archive-date=February 24, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

After playing several hours each night before bed, 60% of users reported seeing pieces of Tetris as they fell asleep and even when they were waking up.<ref name=":22" /> This is a result of hours of game play, which allows the brain to start creating new [[neural pathway]]s. This helps the brain recognize patterns easier and perform well with less effort. The brain starts to get trained to search for more images to organize. Players have been found to unconsciously think about ways they can fit objects together in real life, such as visualizing buildings or store shelves.<ref name=":22" /> Using his findings to build on Richard Haier's previous work, he coined the term "Tetris effect".<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |title=Learning/Tetris |url=https://www.richardhaier.com/articles/learningtetris |access-date=2023-02-16 |website=Richard Haier |date=May 29, 2014 |language=en-US}}</ref>

In January 2009, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] research group headed by [[Emily A. Holmes|Emily Holmes]] reported that, for healthy volunteers, playing ''Tetris'' soon after viewing traumatic material in the laboratory reduced the number of flashbacks to those scenes in the following week. They believe that the computer game may disrupt the memories that are retained of the sights and sounds witnessed at the time, and which are later re-experienced through involuntary, distressing [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] of that moment. The group hoped to develop this approach further as a potential intervention to reduce the flashbacks experienced in [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] but emphasized that these are only preliminary results.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Holmes EA |author2=James EL |author3=Coode-Bate T |author4=Deeprose C |year=2009 |editor1-last=Bell |editor1-first=Vaughan |title=Can playing the computer game "Tetris" reduce the build-up of flashbacks for trauma?

Another notable effect is that, according to a Canadian study in April 2013, playing ''Tetris'' has been found to treat older adolescents with [[amblyopia]] (lazy eye), which was better than patching a victim's well eye to train their weaker eye.
