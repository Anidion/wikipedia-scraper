'''''Nightshade''''' is an [[action game|action]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Ultimate Play the Game]]. It was first released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1985, and was then [[ported]] to the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[BBC Micro]] later that year. It was also ported to the [[MSX]] exclusively in Japan in 1986. In the game, the player assumes the role of a knight who sets out to destroy four demons in a plague-infested village.

The game features scrolling [[isometric projection|isometric]] gameplay, an improvement over its [[flip-screen]]-driven predecessors, ''[[Knight Lore]]'' and ''[[Alien 8]]'', all thanks to an enhanced version of the Ultimate Play the Game's [[Filmation (game engine)|Filmation]] game engine, branded Filmation II. The game received positive reviews upon release; critics praised its gameplay traits, graphics and colours, but one critic was divided over its perceived similarities to its predecessors.

The game is presented in an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] format. The player assumes the role of a [[knight]] who enters the [[Bubonic plague|plague]]-infested village of Nightshade to vanquish four [[demon]]s who reside within.<ref name=SU/> Additionally, all residents from the village have been transformed into [[vampires]] and other supernatural creatures.<ref name=CVG/> Contact with these monsters infects the knight, with repeated contact turning the character from white to yellow and then to green, which will lead to the character's death. The knight may be hit up to three times by an enemy, but the fourth hit will result in a [[life (gaming)|life]] being deducted.<ref name=crash/>

The objective of the game is to locate and destroy four specific demons. Each demon is vulnerable to a particular object which must be collected by the player: a [[hammer]], a [[Bible]], a [[crucifix]] and an [[hourglass]].<ref name=crash/> Once the four items have been collected, the player must track down a specific demon and cast the correct item at it in order to destroy it. Once all four demons have been destroyed, the game will end.<ref name=crash/> In order to defend against other enemies such as vampires and monsters, the player can arm themselves with "antibodies", which can then be thrown at enemies.<ref name=crash/> Antibodies can be found in houses around the village, and will slowly deplete once used by the player. Other collectible items include extra lives and boots, the latter of which enables the player character to run at a faster speed.<ref name=SU/><ref name=crash/>

==Background and release==
Ultimate Play the Game was founded by brothers [[Tim and Chris Stamper]], along with Tim's wife, Carol, from their headquarters in [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] in 1982. They began producing multiple video games for the [[ZX Spectrum]] throughout the early 1980s.<ref name=best>{{cite magazine|title=The Best of British – Ultimate|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/51/ultimate.htm|magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|issue=51|date=April 1988|access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> The company were known for their reluctance to reveal details about their operations and upcoming projects. Little was known about their development process except that they used to work in separate teams; one team would work on graphics whilst the other would concentrate on other aspects such as sound or programming.<ref name=best/> When a journalist reviewing ''Nightshade'' for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' asked Tim and Chris Stamper what the object of the game was they responded: "Oh, we can't tell you that".<ref name="crash"/>

The game was developed with the [[isometric projection]] [[game engine]] known as [[Filmation (game engine)|Filmation II]], an upgraded version of the Filmation engine.<ref name=scroll>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/51/runagain.htm | title=Looking For An Old Angle | magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| issue=51 | date=April 1988 | access-date=3 October 2006}}</ref> The Filmation engine was created by the Stamper brothers to portray 3D imagery. Filmation II used an [[image masking]] technique that drew and filled holes in the background, allowing the game to create composite structures out of pixelated drawings without visual overlay, despite the limitations platforms such as the ZX Spectrum offered.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Design|magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|issue=29|date=June 1986|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/29/game_design.htm|access-date=9 September 2015}}</ref> ''Nightshade'' was first released in the United Kingdom for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1985, and was then [[ported]] to the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[BBC Micro]] later that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nightshade overview|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/nightshade-879850/msx2-879845|website=IGN|publisher=Ziff Davis|access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref> It was also ported to the [[MSX]] exclusively in Japan in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nightshade overview (1985)|url=http://www.igromania.ru/gamebase/175642/|publisher=Igromania|access-date=18 May 2016|language=Russian}}</ref>

The gameplay was also praised by reviewers.
