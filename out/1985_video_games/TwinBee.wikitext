{{nihongo|'''''TwinBee'''''|ツインビー|TsuinBī}} is a [[scrolling shooter|vertically scrolling shooter]] released by [[Konami]] as an [[arcade video game]] in 1985 in Japan. Along with [[Sega]]'s ''[[Fantasy Zone]]'', released a year later, ''TwinBee'' is credited as an early archetype of the "[[Shoot 'em up#Cute 'em ups|cute 'em up]]" type in its genre.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fantasy Zone – Hardcore Gaming 101 |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/fantasy-zone/ |access-date=2023-06-17 |language=en-US}}</ref> It was the first game to run on Konami's [[Bubble System]] hardware.<ref name=twinbeebrochure>{{cite web|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=5172|author=The Archive Flyers Archive staff|title=Japanese promotional brochure for TwinBee}}</ref> ''TwinBee'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] and [[MSX]] in 1986 and has been included in numerous compilations released in later years. The original arcade game was released outside Japan for the first time in the [[Nintendo DS]] compilation ''[[Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits]]''. A mobile phone version was released for i-mode Japan phones in 2003 with edited graphics.

[[TwinBee (series)|Various ''TwinBee'' sequels]] were released for the arcade and home console markets following the original game, some which spawned [[Radio drama in Japan|audio drama]] and [[anime]] adaptations in Japan.

==Gameplay==
''TwinBee'' can be played by up to 2-players simultaneously. The player takes control of a cartoon-like anthropomorphic spacecraft, with Player 1 taking control of TwinBee, the titular ship, while Player 2 controls WinBee. The game control consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons: one for shooting enemies in the air and the other for dropping bombs to ground enemies (similarly to ''[[Xevious]]'').<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=TwinBee – Hardcore Gaming 101 |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/twinbee/ |access-date=2023-06-17 |language=en-US}}</ref>

The player's primary power-ups are bells that can be uncovered by shooting at the floating clouds where they're hidden. If the player continues shooting the bell after it appears, it will change into one of four other colors: the regular yellow bells only grant bonus points, the white bell will upgrade the player's gun into a twin cannon, the blue bell increases the player's speed (for up to five speed levels), the green bell will allow the player to create image copies of its ship for additional firepower, and the red bell will provide the player's ship a barrier that allows it to sustain more damage. The green and red bells cannot be combined. Other power-ups can also be retrieved from ground enemies such as an alternate bell that gives the player's ship a three-way gun, a star which eliminates all on-screen enemies.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book |title=TwinBee: How to Play |publisher=Konami |year=1986 |location=Japan |pages=3 |language=en}}</ref>

As with other games of the same genre, getting shot by a single enemy bullet will cause the player to lose a life. However, if the bullet only strikes either side of the ship instead, the player's ship will only lose one of its arms. If the player's ship loses both arms, it will lose the ability to throw bombs and the player must wait for an ambulance to arrive. The player must navigate their ship to the ambulance to repair their arms. If the player's ship loses both arms for the second time, no ambulance will arrive.

If two players are playing at the same time, they can align their ships vertically or horizontally together to perform more powerful attacks.<ref name=instructions>{{cite video game|title=Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits|developer=M2|publisher=Konami|level=RainbowBell - Archive - Library}}</ref>

''TwinBee'' originally appeared as an arcade game. It was later ported to [[MSX]] and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]].<ref name="konamifc">{{cite web |author=Konami website staff |title=List of Family Computer games by Konami 1985-1987 |url=http://www.konami.co.jp/cs/fc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961108212502/http://www.konami.co.jp/cs/fc.html |archive-date=November 8, 1996 |language=ja}}</ref><ref name="konamimsx">{{cite web |author=Konami website staff |title=List of MSX games by Konami 1983-1986 |url=http://www.konami.co.jp/cs/msx.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961108212537/http://www.konami.co.jp/cs/msx.html |archive-date=November 8, 1996 |language=ja}}</ref> The Famicom version was re-released only in Japan under the [[Classic NES Series#Series 2|Famicom Mini]] label for the [[Game Boy Advance]].
