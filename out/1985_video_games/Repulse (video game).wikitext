[[File:ARC Repulse ('99 - The Last War).png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot]]
''Repulse'' is a fixed shooter game reminiscent of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Phoenix (1980 video game)|Phoenix]]'', in which the player controls a [[laser cannon]] by moving it across the bottom of the screen and firing at robotic enemies and descending alien spaceships through six stages, five of which host a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be defeated in order to progress further.<ref name="RUEhg101">{{cite web|author=Sotenga|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/repulse/repulse.htm|title=Repulse|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=January 23, 2014|access-date=2020-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304210549/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/repulse/repulse.htm|archive-date=2014-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref> The players' laser cannon is equipped with a limited [[force shield]] to endure any kind of enemy attacks, though its energy drains both while activated and whenever the ship gets hit.<ref name="RUEhg101"/> [[Power-up]]s are dropped by ally [[helicopter]]s and ships that bring to the players a faster shot than the normal one and refills the laser cannon's force field meter.<ref name="RUEhg101"/><ref name="RUEmanual">''Repulse'' 取扱説明書 (Arcade, JP)</ref> Reaching certain score thresholds by shooting at the enemies results in [[Life (gaming)#Extra lives|extra lives]].
