'''''Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative''''' was a ''[[Star Trek]]'' themed computer software game by American studio Micromosaics, designed for the [[Apple II Plus]], [[Apple IIe]], and [[Apple IIc]]. The game was also available for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Macintosh]] and [[IBM PC]]. This [[text adventure]] was first published in 1985 by [[Simon & Schuster]]. The player assumes the role of Admiral [[James T. Kirk]]. As Kirk, the player commands the actions of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' crew, as well as the ''Enterprise'' itself.

The plot is based on the idea that Starfleet is replacing the [[Kobayashi Maru]] scenario with a new test based on a mission from the ''Enterprise'' logs. The player is supposedly testing this "Kobayashi Alternative Command Performance Evaluation" for a Starfleet admiral.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' criticized ''Kobayashi'' for many bugs and poor documentation, while approving of the game's design and its portrayal of the crew.{{r|CGW}} The magazine reported that version 1.1 for the Apple with improved documentation still had bugs, including a serious one when visiting Orna, and concluded "I cannot recommend it".{{r|scorpia198608}}
