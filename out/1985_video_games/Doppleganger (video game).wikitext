'''''Doppleganger''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] designed by David T. Clark for the [[Amstrad CPC]] and published by [[Alligata]] and Americana in 1985.

==Gameplay==
You control a sorceress and also her alter ego (the doppleganger) in a 25 room castle (isometric 3D). Each room has a colour coded door frame - which only the sorceress or the doppleganger can pass through. Some doors are locked and need keys. The entire time, an hour glass ticks away which means you have a very limited amount of time to figure out how to top the hourglass back up. Finding the ingots and returning them to the start screen is also challenging, as you will need to switch between the two characters. Some rooms contain moving nasties that can hurt and kill you, also there are a batch of red spiders constantly chasing after the sorceress.
