'''''Europe Ablaze''''' is a [[Wargame (video games)|computer wargame]] developed and published by [[Strategic Studies Group]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Apple II]] in 1985. 
It is based on [[air warfare of World War II]].

== Gameplay ==
''Europe Ablaze'' covers the period 1939 to 1945 and contains three scenarios that depict [[strategic bombing]]s in Europe during [[World War II]]. The scenarios are based on [[Battle of Britain]], Royal Air Force night bombings of summer 1943, and Allied bombings of Germany in 1945.<ref name=Selover>{{cite magazine| last1 = Selover | first1 = Jay |title=Side by Side: Europe Ablaze and USAAF|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=April 1986|issue=27|pages=16–18}}</ref><ref name=McMahon>{{cite journal| last1 = McMahon | first1 = Ken |title= Europe Ablaze: The Air War Over England and Germany 1939-1945|journal=[[Commodore User]]|date=November 1986|issue=38|pages=44–45}}</ref>

The game is built on a modified ''[[Carriers at War 1941-1945: Fleet Carrier Operations in the Pacific|Carriers at War]]'' engine. The units of maneuver are air groups with 5 to 40 planes. The player can control forces of either Axis or Allied powers. Each side has one [[Commander-in-chief]] slot and up to three air [[Fleet Commander]] slots that can be occupied either by human players or by [[artificial intelligence]]. 
Each scenario is broken down into days, which in their turn consist of five-minute intervals.<ref name=Selover/><ref name=McMahon/>
