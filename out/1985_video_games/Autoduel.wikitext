'''''Autoduel''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] published by [[Origin Systems]] for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II]], and [[IBM PC compatible]]s in 1985. It was released in 1987 for the [[Atari ST]] and in 1988 for the [[Amiga]] and [[Macintosh]]. The game is based on the [[Steve Jackson Games]] series ''[[Car Wars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Barton |date=2007-02-23 |work=The History of Computer Role-Playing Games |title=Part 2: The Golden Age (1985-1993) |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130124/the_history_of_computer_.php |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2009-03-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330222049/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070223b/barton_05.shtml |archivedate=30 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''Autoduel'' is set in the [[United States]] in 2030, where cars are a primary means of protection and defense, and the highways are dangerous stretches of land ruled by gangs and [[Vigilantism|vigilante]]s with armed vehicles.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Autoduel_Atari_ST_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot (Atari ST)]]
The player creates a character, names them and distributes 50 points between three skills: driving, marksmanship and mechanic. The player's character starts in New York, Friday 1-1-2030. Without a car, the player has to enter "amateur night" in which they are provided a vehicle in order to raise enough money to buy and equip their own vehicle. With their own vehicle, a character can begin performing courier missions between the various towns along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic seaboard]]—including [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] (Origin's headquarters at the time, which could be visited in the game) and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] among a few. The character may also enter more distinguished Arena events to earn money as well as take to the highways to fight the other cars and salvage their parts. In this sense, the game was very open-ended in what the player could do. The game also had a storyline, involving certain critical courier tasks, such as carrying important criminal evidence against "Mr. Big", through the dangerous terrain between cities.

The main feature of the game is combat involving customized vehicles. The vehicle construction portion of the game allows a variety of power plants, guns, ammunition, mine-layers, smokescreens, oil slicks and rockets to be arranged onto an even larger selection of body and [[chassis]] types.

The game was developed using a top-down perspective and features two distinct setting areas: the arena or highway style area and the city area. The highway and arenas allow acceleration and driving skills to be used in a scrolling screen format, while the [[Urban area|city area]] is a single screen in which stores and other attractions of a city can be visited.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1986 reviewed the game positively, noting, "The game design is clean, the graphics excellent and no bugs were found." The immense difficulty of the game was noted, as was the long learning curve. In emphasis, the review suggested bypassing the [[permanent death]] feature of the game and expensive in-game clones (backup saves) by [[savescumming|making a copy of the character disk]], to return to in case of character death.<ref name="CGW">{{Cite news|date=May 1986|last=Oxner |first=Bill|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|title=Autoduel|pages=24–25}}</ref> In 1992 and 1994 surveys of science fiction games the magazine gave the title two of five stars, writing that "Graphic and game play now appear very dated".<ref name="brooks199211">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100 | title=Strategy & Wargames: The Future (2000-....) | magazine=Computer Gaming World |date = November 1992| accessdate=4 July 2014 | author=Brooks, M.

==Legacy==
In 2018, Steve Jackson posted a public request for the ''Autoduel'' source code, writing "We'd really like to republish ''Autoduel'' in more or less its classic form, updated for modern systems."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/ill/archive/October_18_2018/Wanted_Autoduel_Source_Code |title=Wanted – Autoduel Source Code! |format=w |accessdate=2018-10-18 }}</ref>
