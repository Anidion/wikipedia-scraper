'''Gyroscope''' is an [[action game|action]] [[video game]] published by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]] in 1985 for the [[Acorn Electron]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. It is based on the [[Atari Games]] arcade title ''[[Marble Madness]]''. Melbourne House would go on to publish the official ports of ''Marble Madness'' for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]], but these were not based on ''Gyrosope''.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is very similar to ''Marble Madness'' except the player controls a spinning [[gyroscope]] rather than a [[Marble (toy)|marble]]. The game is presented in [[Isometric projection|isometric]] 3D. The player must guide the gyroscope from the top of the course to the bottom within an allotted time limit. If the gyroscope topples off the edge, a life is lost. Hazards on the course include potholes, aliens and glass slopes which cause the gyroscope to spin in random directions. There are five courses comprising four screens each. The gyroscope had to land on a marked square to complete each level.

==Reception==
