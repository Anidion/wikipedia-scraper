John Sweeney for ''[[Page 6]]'' said "Level 9 seem to have learnt how to cram an incredible amount into 32K. Red Moon has more than adequate descriptions of over 200 locations, scattered with over 50 items, and inhabited by no less than 19 different beings with whom you can interact."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Page_6_Issue_19_1986-01_ABACUS_GB/page/n39/mode/2up|title=Page 6 - Issue 19 (1986-01)(ABACUS)(GB)|date=January 10, 1986|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Peter Sweasey for ''Home Computing Weekly'' said "Although Level 9 can do better, even an average game by them is excellent by other people's standards."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/home-computing-weekly-132/page/n29/mode/2up|title=Home Computing Weekly Magazine Issue 132|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

"The Pilgrim" for ''[[Amstrad Action]]'' said "Level 9 have had a consistent reputation for good games, and ''Red Moon'' is one of the best, if not THE best."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Amstrad_Action_Issue_001/page/38/mode/2up|title=Amstrad Action Issue 001|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Derek Brewster for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' said "''Red Moon'' is a highly competent adventure program which neatly walks the tightrope between absorbing plot and commercial, memory-guzzling colourful graphics."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Crash_No._20_1985-09_Newsfield_GB/page/n91/mode/2up|title=Crash - No. 20 (1985-09)(Newsfield)(GB)|date=September 10, 1985|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Ken Matthews for ''Commodore Horizons'' said "Red Moon is enchanting – the plot is original even if the idea of hit point has been seen before – Level 9 is still the best in Britain."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/CommodoreHorizonsIssue221985Oct300dpi/page/n37/mode/2up|title=Commodore_Horizons_Issue_22_1985_Oct__300dpi_|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

John Minson for ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' said "''Red Moon'' is so richly written by David Williamson and Pete Austin that it makes the term 'interactive novel' seem almost credible."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/popular-computing-weekly-1985-08-22/page/n13/mode/2up|title=Popular Computing Weekly (1985-08-22)|date=August 22, 1985|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

"Miss Adventure" for ''[[Your 64]]'' said "make no mistake, this is a great game. Great descriptions, OK graphics and a magical scenario in every sense."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Your64Issue14Oct85/page/n19/mode/2up|title=Your_64_Issue_14_Oct_85|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Sean Masterson for ''[[Amtix]]'' said "I have no criticisms worth mentioning when it comes to this game; it's a perfect example of how to write a graphic adventure. No gimmicks, fast, intelligent."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Amtix_Magazine_Issue_01/page/86/mode/2up|title=Amtix Magazine Issue 01|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

John Ransley for ''[[Commodore User]]'' said "Level 9 never seems to produce a bad product and indeed the ability of Pete Austin and Co to produce three superb graphic adventures this year alone is itself verging on sorcery."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Commodore_User_Magazine_Issue_024/page/12/mode/2up|title=Commodore User Magazine Issue 024|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

The game won the award for best adventure game of the year in ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' magazine,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/27/awards.htm|title=CRASH 27 - Readers' Awards|website=www.crashonline.org.uk}}</ref> and the game was voted best adventure game of the year at the [[Golden Joystick Awards]].<ref>{{ citation | url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_055_1986-05_EMAP_Publishing_GB/Computer__Video_Games_Issue_055_1986-05_EMAP_Publishing_GB#page/n89/mode/2up | journal=[[C+VG]] | title = Golden Joystick Awards | date=May 1986 | issue=55 | pages=90–91 | publisher=[[Future Publishing]] }}</ref>
