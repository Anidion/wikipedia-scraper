{{nihongo foot|'''''Performan'''''|パフォーマン|''Pafōman''||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[Action game|action]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] developed by [[Toaplan]] and published exclusively in Japan by [[Data East]] in April 1985. In the game, players assume the role of the titular robot in order to defeat enemies across multiple stages. The title is notable for being created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared [[bankruptcy]]. A group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan as a result. Performan is one of the few titles by Toaplan that has not received any official [[Porting#Porting in gaming|port]] to [[Home video game console|home console]]s.

== Gameplay ==

Up to two players control a Performan from a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]]. The main objective on each screen is to eliminate enemies in order to progress further, while an [[cutscene|intermission]] animation plays between some stages.<ref name="PONjpf">''Performan'' arcade flyer (Data East, JP)</ref><ref name="POMhg101">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/toaplan/toaplan.htm|title=Toaplan Shooters (Page 1) - Performan|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=5 February 2011|access-date=2019-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224230422/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/toaplan/toaplan.htm|archive-date=24 February 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Getting hit by an enemy will result in losing a life and once all lives are lost, the game ends unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine.

The player controls a robot with a four-way joystick and two buttons to attack and dig. Players can dive into the ground to avoid enemies that can also perform the same action to chase the player's [[player character| character]]. Players can also attack enemies by throwing [[boomerang]]s, which can trigger the "meca-stones" placed on the playfield to explode and eliminate any enemy caught within its blast radius. Players can also trigger the meca-stones under the ground to eliminate enemies as well. Players can be paralyzed if the robot is caught with its blast radius. Meca-stones can also be pushed against enemies.

After exploding a meca-stone, a gift item is spawned and after picking up the last gift before completing a stage, a "P" icon appears at the center of the playfield that turns into a colored ball. Collecting four colored balls in a row grants an extra life. After blowing up a meca-stone with enemies nearby, a ghost appears and after catching it, the players turn invincible for a brief time period.

Eliminating many enemies at once with an exploding meca-stone grants a determined number of points, which is crucial for achieving high scores.

== Development and release ==
''Performan'' was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan and among them were [[Video game composer|composer]]s Masahiro Yuge and [[Tatsuya Uemura]], both of which recounted the project's development process and history between 1990 and 2012 through Japanese publications such as ''[[Gamest]]'' and ''Shooting Gameside''.<ref name="G49">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/gamest0049#page/69/mode/2up|title=東亜プラン|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|pages=68–69|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name="TFf25v9">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|date=June 2009|pages=1–70|lang=ja}} ([https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201010170328/https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332|date=2020-10-10}}).</ref><ref name="TSCa">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=14 November 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030143/https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711134859/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/|date=2018-07-11}}).</ref><ref name="STGv4a">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Yūsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=東亜プラン特集 - 元・東亜プラン 開発者インタビュー: 上村建也|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=33–40|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023755/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref><ref name="STGv4b">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Yūsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=東亜プラン特集 - 元・東亜プラン 開発者インタビュー: 弓削雅稔|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=41–48|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023744/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref> Both Yuge and Uemura stated that the game was designed by Kenichi Takano and that their development environment at the time of the title's creation was done in the [[bedroom]] of an [[apartment]].<ref name="G49"/><ref name="TFf25v9"/> Uemura worked on the sound design for the game while he still formed part of Crux developing ''[[Repulse (arcade game)|Repulse]]'', but Yuge later assumed the sound design duties after Uemura had a motorcycle accident during development, in addition to programming as well.<ref name="G49"/><ref name="TFf25v9"/><ref name="TSCa"/><ref name="STGv4a"/><ref name="STGv4b"/> ''Performan'' was released only in arcades across Japan by Data East in April 1985.<ref name="PONjpf"/> Uemura stated that the reason why the company was not credited for the title was due to contractual arrangements with Data East.<ref name="TSCa"/><ref name="STGv4a"/>
