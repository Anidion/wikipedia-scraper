==Gameplay==
The player controls the Muncher who must move around a grid eating words that match condition at the top of the screen, while avoiding the threatening Troggles. As the player progresses through the levels, the difficulty of the matching conditions increases, and multiple Troggles pursue the Muncher.

==Educational goals==
The game was designed for first- to fifth-grade students, emphasizing vowel sounds, while teaching students grammar, [[phonics]] and reading skills in addition to introducing new words.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/InCider_A_1991-09/page/n39 |title=The Lighter Side of Education |magazine=inCider/A+ |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=September 1991 |page=39}}</ref><ref name="MECC95-96">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/MECC_catalog_1995-1996_ocr/page/n3 |title=MECC catalog 1995-1996 |author=MECC |date=1995 |publisher=MECC |page=3 |language=en}}</ref>
