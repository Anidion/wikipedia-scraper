== Gameplay ==
The game contains very similar gameplay to the board game it is based on, with various physical tasks being replaced by automation and digital representations.

== Critical reception ==
''Computer Shopper'' praised the game for its graphics and animation, and deemed it "excellent value".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gamer_Issue_17_1986-08_Argus_Press_GB#page/n94/mode/1up|title=Computer Gamer - Issue 17 (1986-08)(Argus Press)(GB)|website=archive.org|date=August 1986 |access-date=2016-10-02}}</ref> ''Your Spectrum'' thought the game was an "excellent conversion" of the board game,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr20/yr20_51.htm|title=Your Spectrum 20 - Joystick Jury|website=www.users.globalnet.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-02}}</ref> while ''Sinclair User'' wrote that the game was "very boring".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-042/SinclairUser_042_Sep_1985#page/n23/mode/1up|title=Sinclair User Magazine Issue 042|website=archive.org|date=September 1985 |access-date=2016-10-02}}</ref> 

In 1990, M. Evan Brooks reviewed the computer editions of ''[[The Computer Edition of Risk: The World Conquest Game|Risk]]'', ''Monopoly'', ''[[The Computer Edition of Scrabble|Scrabble]]'', and ''[[Clue: Master Detective|Clue]]'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Monopoly'' has been released in numerous shareware and public domain versions which thereby weaken its standing."<ref name="CGW69">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M. Evan |title=CLASSIC CONVERSIONS |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=March 1990 |volume=1 |issue=69 |pages=44–45}}</ref>

When the game was released for the Amiga in 1991, ''Amiga Power'' deemed it a "sound conversion" albeit more expensive than its source material,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Amiga_Power_Issue_03_1991-07_Future_Publishing_GB#page/n71/mode/1up|title=Amiga Power - Issue 03 (1991-07)(Future Publishing)(GB)|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-10-02}}</ref> while another from the same publication said it was competent but "arguably quite pointless".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Amiga_Power_Issue_04_1991-08_Future_Publishing_GB#page/n97/mode/1up|title=Amiga Power - Issue 04 (1991-08)(Future Publishing)(GB)|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-10-02}}</ref>
