'''''Jet''''' is a [[combat flight simulator]] [[video game]] originally published in 1985 by [[Sublogic]]. The game was released in 1985 for [[MS-DOS]] and the [[Commodore 64]], 1986 for the [[Apple II]], 1988 for the [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]], and 1989 for the [[Macintosh]] and [[NEC PC-9801]].<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/jet Jet at Mobygames]</ref>

An updated version called ''Jet 2.0'' was released for [[MS-DOS]] in 1987.

==Gameplay==
''Jet'' is easier to fly than ''[[Flight Simulator II (Sublogic)|Flight Simulator II]]'', and is compatible with its scenery disks. The player may choose either an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] for land missions or an [[F/A-18 Hornet]] for missions starting at sea from an aircraft carrier.{{r|florance198606}} The player can also practice flying and aerobatics in "free flight" mode, dogfight against Soviet MiGs, launch strikes against land or sea-based targets, or watch a demo. For either combat mode, the player can select which missiles and bombs the plane will have.

Most of the indicators on a real jet fighter are present in Jet: altimeter, heading, frame loading, gear status, brake status, fuel level, radar, attitude, and range. The player can turn a few of these on and off. The controls consist of either the joystick or numeric keypad for steering and other keys to handle the chosen optional indicators, landing gear, weapons, and an eject button. Different perspectives can be chosen - a view from the control tower instead of the jet's cockpit.

==Reception==
''Jet'' was Sublogic's second best-selling Commodore 64 game as of late 1987.<ref name="ferrell198712">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-12-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_54_1987_Dec#page/n17/mode/2up | title=The Commodore Games That Live On And On | work=Compute's Gazette | date=December 1987 | accessdate=24 January 2015 | author=Ferrell, Keith | pages=18–22}}</ref> Describing it as "an upscale, friendlier version of ''Flight Simulator'', ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' in 1986 said that the Commodore 64 version was "a great computer game doing what it does best—and letting you have some fun".<ref name="florance198606">{{Cite magazine |last=Florance |first=David |date=June 1986 |title=Jet |url=https://archive.org/details/1986-06-computegazette/page/n49 |magazine=Compute!'s Gazette |page=48 |access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' in 1987 favorably reviewed the Apple II version of ''Jet'' and its excellent graphics, but criticized the slow performance, reporting that it was "painfully slow" at updating the display.<ref name="williams198705">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_084_1987_May#page/n49/mode/2up | title=Jet | work=Compute! | date=May 1987 | accessdate=9 November 2013 | author=Williams, Michael B. | pages=48}}</ref>

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called ''Jet'' "more of a 'game'" than ''[[F/A-18 Interceptor]]'', which the magazine described as "a 'toy' ... you play a game, you play ''with'' a toy".
