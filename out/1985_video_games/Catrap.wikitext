'''''Catrap''''', known as '''''Pitman''''' in Japan, is a [[puzzle-platform game]] developed for the [[Sharp MZ|Sharp MZ-700]] computer in 1985 and published by [[Asmik Ace|Asmik]] for the Nintendo [[Game Boy]] in 1990. The Game Boy version was re-released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Virtual Console]] in October 2011.

The word ''Catrap'' refers to the frequent number of times the player is trapped and needs to reverse their movements and the two [[anthropomorphic]] [[cat]]s the player must maneuver to advance through the levels.

''[[Destructoid]]'' credits the game with using a time-rewind mechanic before games like ''[[Blinx: The Time Sweeper|Blinx]]'', ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', and ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]''.<ref name="credited">Ashley Davis, [http://www.destructoid.com/why-catrap-is-the-coolest-puzzle-game-you-ve-never-played-147180.phtml Why Catrap is the coolest puzzle game you've never played], [[Destructoid]]</ref>

==Gameplay==
Catrap is a puzzle game. The player directs the avatar, an anthropomorphic cat, to navigate a room while clearing obstacles and kicking monsters and ghosts off the screen. Once the player has knocked all of the enemies off the screen, they advance to the next level. Advancement grows difficult for the player as increasingly intricate obstacles are presented to complicate the process of overcoming all of the monsters and ghosts. The game encourages trial and error. A player may try one combination of manoeuvres by moving the obstacle in one direction, then they may find themselves trapped. The player can hit the 'A'-button to reverse their movements and try again in a different way until they find the solution that enables them to access all of the enemies and knock them off the screen. Trial and error make up a large portion of the game. Players can also create their own mazes.

There are 100 levels for the player to clear, each one more difficult than the last with more room for error and typically take longer to complete. The first level involves no obstacles with one monster on the opposite side of the screen to knock off; the last level involves a blockade of boulders and a conundrum of ladders for the player to move and navigate to clear several floating ghosts, the most difficult level with the smallest margin for error.

==Development and release==
The game concept was originally created in 1985 on a [[Sharp MZ|MZ-700]] home computer by Yutaka Isokawa. The [[BASIC]] [[Listing (computer)|listing]] of the game was published in the August 1985 issue of the magazine "Oh!MZ Publications" as [[type-in program]].<ref>Hardcore Gaming 101, [http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/08/who-framed-created-pitman.html Who created PITMAN?] on hardcoregaming101.net (2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-09-12-the-untold-history-of-japanese-game-developers-dvd-review  The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers DVD review] by Tom Massey on [[Eurogamer]] ''"[Catrap] creator Yukata Isokawa's emphatic emotional response to receiving a long-lost magazine featuring his original source code is particularly memorable."'' (2014-09-12)</ref> The popularity of the game caused it to be picked up for [[Game Boy]] conversion in 1990. In the Game Boy version there is a nod to the MZ-700 version, the layout of round 77 is a big M and Z. In 2004 it was released for [[I-mode]] mobile phones as Pitmania and Pitmania 2, with graphics more similar to the original MZ700 game. Pitmania 1 Infinite was released in 2007, which had improved and more colorful graphics. A version was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in the [[3DS eShop]] in October 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=NintendoWare Weekly: ''Catrap'', 101-in-1 |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/10/13/nintendoware-weekly-catrap-101-in-1/|first=JC |last=Fletcher |date=2011-10-13 |work=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=2011-10-14}}</ref> In 2012 the game community restored a faithful as possible Sharp MZ-700 version from the available source code variants.<ref>[http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2012/07/the-almost-original-version-of-pitman.html The (almost) original version of Pitman (Catrap) preserved] (July 19, 2012)</ref>
