'''''Big Mac: The Mad Maintenance Man''''' (shown on the box cover as '''''More Adventures of Big Mac: The Mad Maintenance Man''''' and often abbreviated '''''Big Mac''''') is a video game published in 1985 by [[Mastertronic]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. It is a platform game in the style of ''[[Manic Miner]]''.<ref name='zzap_review'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=002&amp;page=054&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap|title = Redirecting}}</ref>

The player takes on the role of the title character who must negotiate a power station consisting of 18 separate levels (vaults).  On each level the aim is to avoid a range of defences and press switches to shut down the vault.<ref name='zzap_review' />

==Reception==
The game received a 79% rating from ''Zzap!64''.  They found the graphics somewhat basic, though nicely animated.  The music was complimented and overall the game was considered to be good value for money.<ref name='zzap_review' />

==Legacy==
The game was hacked by GÃ¡bor Herczeg and re-released as a [[freeware]] "[[sequel]]" under the name ''Big Mac II''. This game was in fact the same as the original but with extra levels.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://plus4.emucamp.com/sd.php?pid=15195 |title=EmuCamp |access-date=2006-10-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310210550/http://plus4.emucamp.com/sd.php?pid=15195 |archive-date=2007-03-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
