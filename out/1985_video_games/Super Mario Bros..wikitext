{{Nihongo foot|'''''Super Mario Bros.'''''|スーパーマリオブラザーズ|Sūpā Mario Burazāzu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[platform game]] developed and published in 1985 by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Famicom]] in Japan and for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in North America. It is the successor to the 1983 arcade game ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' and the first game in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. Following a US test market release for the NES, it was converted to international [[arcade game|arcades]] on the [[Nintendo VS. System]] in early 1986. The NES version received a wide release in North America that year and in [[PAL regions]] in 1987.

Players control [[Mario]], or his brother [[Luigi]] in the multiplayer mode, to explore the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] to rescue [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] from King Koopa (later named [[Bowser]]). They traverse [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of [[power-up]]s such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and [[Starman (Mario)|Starman]].

The game was designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Takashi Tezuka]] as "a grand culmination" of the Famicom team's three years of game mechanics and programming, drawing from their experiences working on ''[[Devil World]]'' and the side-scrollers ''[[Excitebike]]'' and ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung Fu]]'' to advance their previous work on platforming "[[Platform game|athletic games]]" such as ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and ''Mario Bros.'' The design of the first level, [[World 1-1]], is a [[Tutorial (video gaming)|tutorial]] for platform gameplay.

''Super Mario Bros.'' is frequently cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], and is particularly admired for its precise controls. It has been re-released on most Nintendo systems, and is one of the [[bestselling games of all time]], with more than {{nowrap|58 million}} copies sold worldwide. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the [[Video game crash of 1983|1983 crash]], and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. [[Super Mario Bros. theme|Koji Kondo's soundtrack]] is one of the earliest and most popular in video games, making music a centerpiece of game design and has since been considered [[List of video game soundtracks considered the best|one of the best video game soundtracks of all time]] as a result. Mario has become prominent in popular culture, and ''Super Mario Bros.'' began [[Mario (franchise)|a multimedia franchise]] including a long-running game series, [[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!|an animated television series]], [[Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!|a Japanese anime feature film]], [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|a live-action feature film]] and [[The Super Mario Bros. Movie|an animated feature film]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:NES Super Mario Bros.png|thumb|left|Mario wields a [[Fire Flower]], allowing attacks with fire projectiles. To the left of Mario is an [[Starman (Mario)|invincibility Starman]].|alt=Refer to caption]]
The player controls [[Mario]], the titular protagonist of [[Mario (franchise)|the series]]. Mario's brother, [[Luigi]], is controlled by the second player in [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode and assumes the same plot role and functionality as Mario. The objective is to quickly explore the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the main antagonist Bowser's forces, and save Princess Toadstool.<ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" />{{rp|7}} It is a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] where the player moves to the right to reach the flagpole at the end of each level.

The Mushroom Kingdom includes coins for Mario to collect and special bricks marked with a question mark (''?''), which when hit from below by Mario may reveal more coins or a special item. Other "secret", often invisible, bricks may contain more coins or rare items. If the player gains a [[Super Mushroom]], Mario grows to double his size and gains the ability to break bricks above him. If Mario gets hit in this mode, then instead of dying he turns back to regular Mario.<ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" />{{rp|12}} Players start with a certain number of [[life (gaming)|lives]] and may gain [[Extra life|extra lives]] by picking up green spotted [[1-up mushroom]]s hidden in bricks, collecting 100 coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls in a bottomless pit, or runs out of time. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although a button input can be used on the game over screen to respawn from the first level of the world in which the player died.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |title= Why didn't you tell me about this Super Mario Bros. cheat?|

Mario's primary attack is jumping on top of enemies, though many enemies have differing responses to this. For example, a [[Goomba]] will flatten and be defeated,<ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" />{{rp|12}} while a [[Koopa Troopa]] will temporarily retract into its shell, allowing Mario to use it as a projectile.<ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" />{{rp|11}} These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him.<ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" />{{rp|19}} Other enemies, such as underwater foes and enemies with spiked tops, cannot be jumped on and damage the player instead. Mario can also defeat enemies above him by jumping to hit the brick that the enemy is standing on. Mario may also acquire the [[Fire flower]] from certain "?" blocks that when picked up changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs.  A less common item is the [[Starman (Mario)|Starman]], which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item grants Mario temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers.<ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" />{{rp|10}}

The game consists of eight worlds, each with four sub-levels or stages.<ref name="IGN VC">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/06/super-mario-bros-vc-review |title=Super Mario Bros.

Bonuses and secret areas include more coins, or warp pipes that allow Mario to skip directly to later worlds. The final stage of each world is in a fiery underground castle where Bowser is fought on a [[suspension bridge]] above lava; the first seven of these Bowsers are actually minions disguised as him, and the real Bowser is in the eighth world. Bowser and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them or running under them while they are jumping and reaching the axe on the end of the bridge, or with fireballs. After completing the game once, the player is rewarded with the ability to replay with increased difficulty, such as all Goombas replaced with Buzzy Beetles, enemies similar to Koopa Troopas who cannot be defeated using the Fire Flower.<ref name="allgame">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Geoffrey Douglas |title=Super Mario Bros – Review |website=[[Allgame]] |access-date=December 6, 2012 |url=http://allgame.com/game.php?id=1320&tab=review |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114120755/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1320&tab=review |archive-date=November 14, 2014 }}</ref>

==Plot==
Following the events of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', the game is set in the fantasy land of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] after [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] had arrived through a clay pipe from [[New York City]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 25, 2023 |title=マリオ映画公開記念！宮本茂さんインタビュー 制作の始まりから驚きの設定まで |trans-title=Commemorating the release of the Mario movie!

In the Mushroom Kingdom, a tribe of turtle-like [[Koopa Troopa]]s invade the kingdom and uses the magic of their king [[Bowser]] to turn the Mushroom People into inanimate objects such as bricks, stones, and horsehair plants. Bowser and his army also kidnap [[Princess Toadstool]] of the Mushroom Kingdom, the only one with the ability to reverse Bowser's spell. After hearing the news, the brothers set out to save the princess and free the kingdom from Bowser.<ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet">{{cite book |title=Super Mario Bros.

After each defeat of a decoy Bowser, the mushroom retainer proclaims, "[[Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!]]". Finally, they reach Bowser's true stronghold, where they defeat him by throwing fireballs or by dropping him into lava, freeing the princess and saving the Mushroom Kingdom.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Super Mario Bros. |date=September 13, 1985 |developer=Nintendo |publisher=Nintendo |level=World 8-4}}</ref>

For ''Super Mario Bros.'', Miyamoto wanted to create a more colorful "athletic game" with a [[Side-scrolling video game|scrolling screen]] and larger characters.<ref name="iwataasks25_12"/>

Development was a culmination of their technical knowledge from working on the 1984 games ''[[Devil World]]'', ''[[Excitebike]]'' and ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung Fu]]'' along with their desire to further advance the platforming "athletic game" genre they had created with their earlier games.<ref name="Miyamoto Reveals All" /> The [[side-scrolling]] gameplay of [[racing game]] ''Excitebike'' and [[beat 'em up]] game ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'', the latter ported by Miyamoto's team to the NES as ''Kung Fu'', were key steps towards Miyamoto's vision of an expansive side-scrolling platformer;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=Beyond Donkey Kong: A History of Nintendo Arcade Games |date=July 30, 2020 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-4176-8 |page=149 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXD0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA149 |access-date=April 12, 2021 |archive-date=April 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412092144/https://books.google.com/books?id=UXD0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA149 |url-status=live }}</ref> in turn, ''Kung-Fu Master'' was an adaptation of the [[Jackie Chan]] film ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' (1984).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dingman |first1=Shane |title=Thirty things to love about Mario as Nintendo's star turns 30 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/30-things-to-love-about-mario-as-nintendos-star-turns-30/article26329371/ |access-date=December 13, 2021 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=September 11, 2015 |language=en-CA |url-access=registration |archive-date=December 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211213101045/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/30-things-to-love-about-mario-as-nintendos-star-turns-30/article26329371/ |url-status=live }}</ref> While working on ''Excitebike'' and ''Kung Fu'', he came up with the concept of a platformer that would have the player "strategize while scrolling sideways" over long distances, have aboveground and underground levels, and have colorful backgrounds rather than black backgrounds.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[Shigeru Miyamoto]] |date=December 2010 |title=Super Mario Bros. 25th Anniversary - Interview with Shigeru Miyamoto #2 |language=Japanese |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNa0M1gymgA |publisher=[[Nintendo Channel]] |access-date=April 12, 2021 |archive-date=August 18, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210818032229/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNa0M1gymgA |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Super Mario Bros.'' used the fast scrolling [[game engine]] Miyamoto's team had originally developed for ''Excitebike'', which allowed Mario to smoothly [[accelerate]] from a walk to a run, rather than move at a constant speed like in earlier platformers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Andrew |title=History of Digital Games: Developments in Art, Design and Interaction |date=March 16, 2017 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-317-50381-1 |pages=152–4}}</ref>

The development of ''Super Mario Bros.'' is an early example of [[Division of labor|specialization]] in the video game industry, made possible and necessary by the Famicom's arcade-capable hardware. Miyamoto designed the game world and led a team of seven programmers and artists who turned his ideas into code, sprites, music, and sound effects.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Casey |last=O'Donnell |title=This Is Not A Software Industry |encyclopedia=The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future |editor-first1=Peter |editor-last1=Zackariasson |editor-first2=Timothy L. |editor-last2=Wilson |publisher=Routledge |year=2012}}</ref> Developers of previous hit games joined the team in February 1985, importing many special programming techniques, features, and design refinements such as these: "''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''{{'}}s slopes, lifts, conveyor belts, and ladders; ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]''{{'}}s ropes, logs and springs; and ''Mario Bros.''{{'}}s enemy attacks, enemy movement, frozen platforms and POW Blocks".<ref name=Culmination/><ref name="SMBDK">{{cite web|url=https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/wii/mario25th/4/3/|date=September 13, 2010|title=Iwata Asks: Super Mario 25th Anniversary, Vol. 5, Page 4|author=Satoru Iwata|work=[[Nintendo]]|access-date=April 17, 2024}}</ref>

The team based the level design around a small Mario, intending to later make his size bigger in the final version, but they decided it would be fun to let Mario change his size via a [[power-up]]. The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in [[World 1-1]], the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letting Everyone Know It Was A Good Mushroom |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |work=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros Wii |publisher=Nintendo |access-date=December 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927194716/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |archive-date=September 27, 2016  }}</ref> The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by [[Japanese folktales]] in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named the "Mushroom Kingdom".

===World 1-1===
{{Main|World 1-1}}
During the [[third generation of video game consoles]], tutorials on gameplay were rare.  Instead, [[level design]] teaches players how a video game works. The opening section of ''Super Mario Bros.'' was therefore specifically designed in such a way that players would be forced to explore the mechanics of the game to be able to advance. Rather than confront the newly oriented player with obstacles, the first level of ''Super Mario Bros.'' lays down the variety of in-game hazards by means of repetition, iteration, and escalation.<ref name=1UP>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/features/learning-level-design-mario |website=[[1UP.com]] |title=Learning Through Level Design with Mario |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |year=2012 |access-date=May 1, 2016 |archive-date=March 14, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314102722/http://www.1up.com/features/learning-level-design-mario |url-status=dead }}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Eurogamer]]'', Miyamoto explained that he created World 1-1 to contain everything a player needs to "gradually and naturally understand what they're doing", so that they can quickly understand how the game works.

Kondo's work on ''Super Mario Bros.'' was one of the major forces in the shift towards music becoming an integral and participatory part of video games.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |title=Koji Kondo's Super Mario Bros.

The music of ''Super Mario Bros.'' is coordinated with the onscreen animations of the various sprites, which was one way which Kondo created a sense of greater immersion. Kondo was not the first to do this in a video game; for instance, ''[[Space Invaders]]'' features a simple song that gets faster as the aliens speed up, eliciting a sense of stress and impending doom which matches the increasing challenge of the game.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Koji Kondo's Super Mario Bros.

Kondo's compositions were largely influenced by the game's gameplay, intending for it to "heighten the feeling" of how the game controls.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Koji Kondo's Super Mario Bros.

Before composition began, a prototype of the game was presented to Kondo so that he could get an idea of Mario's general environment and revolve the music around it. Kondo wrote the score with the help of a small piano to create appropriate melodies to fit the game's environments. After the development of the game showed progress, Kondo began to feel that his music did not quite fit the pace of the game, so he changed it a bit by increasing the songs' [[tempo]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3163588 |title=Super Mario Bros.

''VS. Super Mario Bros.'' is a 1986 arcade adaptation of ''Super Mario Bros'' (1985), released on the Nintendo VS. System and the Nintendo VS. Unisystem (and its variant, Nintendo VS. Dualsystem). Existing levels were made much more difficult, with narrower platforms, more dangerous enemies, fewer hidden power-ups, and 200 coins needed for an extra life instead of 100.

A remake of the game titled ''Super Mario Bros. Special'' developed by [[Hudson Soft]] was released in Japan in 1986 for the [[NEC PC-8801]] and [[Sharp X1]] personal computers.

(video game)|Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref name="30 years"/>

===Contemporary reviews===
Clare Edgeley of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the arcade version a positive review upon its [[Amusement Trades Exhibition International|ATEI]] 1986 debut. She felt the graphics were simple compared to other arcade games (such as Sega's ''[[Space Harrier]]'' at the same ATEI show), but was surprised at the depth of gameplay, including its length, number of hidden secrets, and the high degree of dexterity it required. She predicted that the game would be a major success.<ref name="CVG53"/> In the fall of 1986, ''Top Score'' newsletter reviewed ''Vs. Super Mario Bros.'' for arcades, calling it "without a doubt one of the best games" of the year and stating that it combined "a variety of proven play concepts" with "a number of new twists" to the gameplay.<ref name="Top-Score-ARC">{{cite news |title=Strategy Session: How to Master Vs.

Reviewing the NES version, the "Video Game Update" segment of ''[[Computer Entertainer]]'' magazine in June 1986 praised the "cute and comical" graphics, lively music and most of all its depth of play, including the amount of hidden surprises and discoveries. The review said it was worthy of "a spot in the hall of fame reserved for truly addictive action games" and was a "must-have" NES game.<ref name="Entertainer">{{cite magazine |title=The Video Game Update: Super Mario Bros. |magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]] |date=June 1986 |volume=5 |issue=3 |page=12 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/7/75/ComputerEntertainer_US_Vol.5_03.pdf#page=12 |access-date=March 29, 2021 |archive-date=May 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210516212107/https://retrocdn.net/images/7/75/ComputerEntertainer_US_Vol.5_03.pdf#page=12 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/the-first-and-only-review-of-super-mario-bros-1512006398 |title=The First and Only English-Language Review of Super Mario Bros |last1=Hamilton |first1=Kirk |website=Kotaku |date=January 30, 2014 |access-date=October 17, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122125652/https://kotaku.com/the-first-and-only-review-of-super-mario-bros-1512006398 |archive-date=January 22, 2018 }}</ref> By that September, teenage videogame journalist [[Rawson Stovall]] declared in his syndicated column, "[The game's universe and plot] elements...[help] develop [a] special style that makes [playing it] a must."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stovall |first1=Rawson |author1-link=Rawson Stovall |title=Adventure has met its match |url=https://newspapers.com/article/abilene-reporter-news-super-mario-bros/148399373/ |access-date=2024-05-30 |work=[[Abilene Reporter-News]] |department=Video Beat |date=1986-09-12 |page=2D |url-access=registration |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> ''Top Score'' also reviewed the NES version in early 1987, noting that it is mostly the same as the arcade version and stating that it was "a near-perfect game" with simple play mechanics, "hundreds of incentives" and hidden surprises, an "ever-changing" environment, colorful graphics and "skillfully blended" music.<ref name="Top-Score-NES"/>

''[[The Games Machine]]'' reviewed the NES version upon its European release in 1987, calling it "a great and playable game" with praise for the gameplay, which it notes is simple to understand without needing to read the manual and has alternate routes for problems that can occasionally be frustrating but rewarding, while also praising the "splendid" graphics and sound.<ref name="TGM">{{cite magazine |title=Making Turtle Soup: Super Mario Bros. |magazine=[[The Games Machine]] |date=November 19, 1987 |issue=2 (December 1987 - January 1988) |page=148 |url=http://amr.abime.net/amr_popup_picture.php?src=the_games_machine/magscans/tgm02_1987_12/039.jpg&c=24249 |access-date=March 5, 2022 |archive-date=August 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815115350/http://amr.abime.net/amr_popup_picture.php?src=the_games_machine%2Fmagscans%2Ftgm02_1987_12%2F039.jpg&c=24249 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1989, ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' called it the "undisputed king of cutesy platform-style arcade adventures" and that the "game is crammed with secret levels, 'warps' and hidden treats such that you never tire of playing it".

The success of ''Super Mario Bros.'' led to the development of many successors in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of video games, which in turn form the core of the greater [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]]. Two of these sequels, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', was released for the [[Famicom Disk System]] in 1986 exclusively in Japan and was later released elsewhere under the name ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]''. The gameplay concepts and elements established in ''Super Mario Bros.'' are prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one ''Super Mario'' game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' is widely considered one of the greatest games ever made and is largely credited with revolutionizing the platforming genre of video games and its step from 2D to 3D. The series is [[List of best-selling video game franchises|one of the bestselling]], with more than 310&nbsp;million units sold worldwide {{as of | September 2015 | lc=yes}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/happy-birthday-super-mario-181332681.html?nf=1 |title=Happy 30th birthday, 'Super Mario Bros.'! |author=Morris, Chris |date=September 13, 2015 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |work=Yahoo!

Because of its status within the video game industry and being an early Nintendo game, [[mint condition]] copies of ''Super Mario Bros.'' have been considered collectors items.

Video game developer [[Yuji Naka]] has cited ''Super Mario Bros.'' as a large inspiration toward the concept for the immensely successful 1991 [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] game, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''; according to Naka, the game was conceived when he was speedrunning [[World 1-1]] of ''Super Mario Bros.'', and considered a platformer based on moving as fast as possible.<ref name=altMW/>

''Super Mario Bros.'' inspired several [[fangame]]s. In 2009, developer SwingSwing released ''[[Tuper Tario Tros]]'', a game which combines elements of ''Super Mario Bros.'' with ''[[Tetris]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|title=Tuper Tario Tros.

===Minus World===
{{Main|Minus World}}
The '''Minus World''' (or Negative World or World Negative One) is an unbeatable [[glitch]] level present in the original NES release. World 1-2 contains a hidden [[warp (video games)|warp zone]], with warp pipes that transport the player to worlds 2, 3, and 4, accessed by running over a wall near the exit. If the player is able to exploit a bug that allows Mario to pass through bricks, the player can enter the warp zone by passing through the wall and the pipe to World 2-1 and 4-1 may instead transport the player to an underwater stage labeled "World -1". This stage's map is identical to worlds 2-2 and 7–2, and upon entering the warp pipe at the end, the player is taken back to the start of the level, thus trapping the player in the level until all lives have been lost. Although the level name is shown as "&nbsp;-1" with a leading space on the [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]], it is actually World 36–1, with the tile for 36 being shown as a blank space.<ref name=world36>{{cite journal |url=http://www.transformationsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ashton-Newman_Trans20.pdf |title=Slow Play Strategies: Digital Games Walkthroughs and the Perpetual Upgrade Economy |first1=Daniel |last1=Ashton |first2=James |last2=Newman |journal=Transformations Journal |date=2011 | issn=1444-3775 | access-date=March 14, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315134405/http://www.transformationsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ashton-Newman_Trans20.pdf |archive-date=March 15, 2018  }}</ref>

The Minus World bug in the Japanese Famicom Disk System version of the game behaves differently and creates multiple, completable stages. "World -1" is an underwater version of World 1–3 with an underwater level [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] and underwater level music and contains [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] of Princess Toadstool, Bowser and Hammer Bros. World -2 is an identical copy of World 7–3, and World -3 is a copy of World 4–4 with an underground level color palette and underground level music, and does not loop if the player takes the wrong path, contrary to the original World 4-4. After completing the level, [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]]'s usual message is displayed, but Toad himself is absent. After completing these levels, the game returns to the [[Title screen (gaming)|title screen]] as if completed, and is now replayable as if in a harder mode, since it is higher than world 8.<ref name=altMW>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/09/30-years-30-memorable-facts-about-super-mario-bros/ |title=30 years, 30 memorable facts about Super Mario Bros. |access-date=September 15, 2015 |first=Kyle |last=Orland |date=September 14, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914233725/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/09/30-years-30-memorable-facts-about-super-mario-bros/ |archive-date=September 14, 2015  }}</ref><ref name=kotaku1>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/super-mario-bros/japanese-famicom-smb-minus-world-203229.php |title=Japanese Famicom SMB Minus World |access-date=August 27, 2008 |work=Kotaku |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104055353/http://kotaku.com/203229/japanese-famicom-smb-minus-world?tag=gamingsupermariobros |archive-date=January 4, 2013 }}</ref> There are hundreds of glitch levels beyond the Minus World (256 worlds are present including the 8 playable ones), which can be accessed in a multitude of ways, such as [[Cheating in video games|cheat codes]] or [[ROM hacking]].<ref name=256mWs>{{cite web |url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/super-mario-bros/misc/#the-secret-minus-world |title=The Secret Minus World |website=Legends of Localization |access-date=March 14, 2018 |quote=American gamers eager for more Mario stuff went bonkers when the above trick got out.
