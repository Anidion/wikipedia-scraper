'''''Back to the Future''''' is a 1985 [[video game]] released by [[Electric Dreams Software]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. The game is loosely based on the 1985 [[Back to the Future|film of the same name]].

==Gameplay==
The game is a side view arcade adventure. The aim of the game is to get George McFly to spend as much time as possible with Lorraine Baines. The more time George and Lorraine spend together, the more they will fall in love, and thus more segments will be added to the family [[photograph]] in the
bottom right corner. The photograph in the bottom right and left of the screen gradually disappear if the player does nothing, thus setting a time limit on the game.

The player can find various object to help him such as love [[poem]]s, a cup of [[coffee]], alien suit and a [[guitar]]. He also has a [[skateboard]] to move around quickly.

Max Phillips, reviewer for YS magazine, summarised the game as "not a bad conversion of the plot. Nice to see an original game concept. It may even be very clever. But I can't say it's very much fun to play". ZX Computing magazine said it was "overpriced and over-hyped",<ref>ZX Computing magazine, issue 8606 page 11</ref> and Computer Gamer added, "buy this at your peril".<ref>Computer Gamer magazine issue 15 page 63</ref>

Mark Eyles, one of the developers, commented:

<blockquote>''Back to the Future'' was a bit of a rush. We knocked it out in about two months flat. We really wanted about twice as long to do the film justice, but the deadline was pressing...<ref>''[[Sinclair User]]'', December 1986</ref></blockquote>

===Rerelease===
Virgin included the game in their 1987 compilation ''Now Games 4'', along with ''[[Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future]]'', ''[[Mission Omega]]'', ''[[Hacker (video game)|Hacker]]'' and ''[[Jonah Barrington (squash player)|Jonah Barrington]] Squash''.
