'''''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''''' is a 1985 video game developed by British studio Soft Option<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=999&label_id=13471|title = Spectrum Computing - ZX Spectrum games, software and hardware}}</ref> and published by Hill MacGibbon. It was released in the United Kingdom for the [[ZX Spectrum]]. It is loosely based on [[Roald Dahl]]'s 1964 [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|book of the same name]], and consumers had the option of buying the game and book as a set.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=4 June 1985 |title=A right Charlie |magazine=Home Computing Weekly |location=United Kingdom |page=7}}</ref><ref name=Crash/>

==Gameplay==
''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' is loosely based on the book of the same name.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=HCW/><ref name=YC/> The game includes four different single-screen games based on characters from the book. A fifth game, an [[arcade adventure]], is also playable.<ref name=Crash/> In the first of the four games, the player must guide [[Augustus Gloop]] around a maze. In the second game, [[Violet Beauregarde]] is being attacked by blueberries and must deflect them into a juicing machine. In the third game, [[Veruca Salt (character)|Veruca Salt]] is being attacked by squirrels after enraging them, and she must leave behind poisoned nuts as a defense, although the poison has a limited lifespan. In the fourth game, [[Mike Teavee]] travels across multiple floors trying to collect [[Wonka Bar]]s, while also avoiding cameras that attack with a shrinking ray.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YC/><ref name=YS/>

The arcade adventure takes place in [[Willy Wonka]]'s 43-room chocolate factory. Playing as [[Charlie Bucket|Charlie]], the player must traverse the factory in search of six gold keys, which will allow the player to enter the Great Glass Lift and win the game.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YC/> The player must complete each of the four games in order to win the arcade adventure. However, the latter game is still playable in practice mode without completing the four others. The golden keys are absent from the arcade adventure game in practice mode, preventing the player from completing it.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YC/><ref name=ZXC/>

The graphics were criticized by some reviewers who described them as outdated and flickery.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=HCW/><ref name=CG/> Reviewers for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' were disappointed with the game.<ref name=Crash/> Some critics believed that the game was misleadingly advertised as having four distinct games. ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' wrote that "when you load side one of the tape, there is only one program on there, not four. So what you are really getting is a single game with four screens."<ref name=CG>{{cite magazine |date=July 1985 |title=Charlie and The Chocolate Factory |magazine=Computer Gamer |location=United Kingdom |page=52}}</ref> ''Home Computing Weekly'' wrote, "The four arcade games on side one of the tape actually load as a single 48K block of code, so what you really get is a single game with four screens and none of them are particularly interesting".<ref name=HCW/>

''Computer Gamer'' found each of the four games boring.<ref name=CG/> ''ZX Computing'' stated that the four games "are all reasonable and provide good though not very sophisticated entertainment. They are quite difficult to master".<ref name=ZXC/> ''[[Sinclair Programs]]'' wrote that the games were difficult, held no long term appeal, and failed to capture "the anarchic humour of the book."<ref name=SP/> ''Home Computing Weekly'' wrote that the arcade adventure "is somewhat better, though that's not really saying much."<ref name=HCW/> Critics compared the arcade adventure portion to ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'',<ref name=HCW/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YS/> and ''[[Manic Miner]]''.<ref name=YC/><ref name=PCW/>

Clare Edgely of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' wrote that the game "palls after a very short time. However, as the package comprises five games and the book it must represent reasonable value for money."<ref name=SU/> ''Popular Computing Weekly'' wrote, "If you think of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', not as anything dramatically wonderful or original, but as five reasonable arcade games for £9.95 it's rather good."<ref name=PCW>{{cite magazine |date=23 May 1985 |title=New Releases |magazine=Popular Computing Weekly |location=United Kingdom |page=43}}</ref> Other critics considered the game to be overpriced.<ref name=CG/><ref name=YS/> ''Home Computing Weekly'' concluded, "Even with the four screens on side one taken into account this 'multi-screen adventure' simply does not justify its high cost."<ref name=HCW/>

''Computer Gamer'' liked the idea of getting children interested in books through computer games, but opined that the effort was done poorly, stating that the game "just doesn't do justice to the book."<ref name=CG/> Other critics found the game forgettable and recommended the book instead as a superior choice.<ref name=HCW/><ref name=YS/> Robin Candy of ''Crash'' later wrote that ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' "relates only vaguely to the book and [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|film]], and the licence is little more than a way to sell an unsatisfying game."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Candy |first=Robin |date=January 1988 |title=Tie-Ins Part Two: Games of the Book |magazine=Crash |location=United Kingdom |page=38}}</ref>
