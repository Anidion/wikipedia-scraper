{{nihongo|'''''Cosmic Soldier'''''|コズミックソルジャー}} is a [[role-playing video game]] for [[MSX]] home computers and is the first game in the ''Cosmic Soldier'' series. It was published in 1985 by [[Kogado Studio]]. The game was ported to the [[NEC PC-8801]] with an updated interface and graphics.

The game uses a [[Dialog tree|dialog conversation system]], where the player can recruit allies by speaking to them, choose whether to kill or spare an enemy, and engage enemies in conversation, similar to the later ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. Battles are fought in a [[turn-based]] style. The game displays some [[Eroge|nudity]] on the title screen.<ref name=HG-101>{{cite web|author=Yamaarashi|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/psychicwar/psychicwar.htm|title=Cosmic Soldier|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=2011-03-31|archive-date=2010-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114134216/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/psychicwar/psychicwar.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The 1987 sequel, '''''Psychic War: Cosmic Soldier 2''''', was originally released for the [[MSX2]] computer in Japan. In America, the game was released by Kyodai, and they changed the name to Psychic War and released the game for [[MS-DOS]] computers. The MS-DOS version censors Kayla's clothing. It changed the turn-based combat of its predecessor to a unique "[[tug of war]]" style [[Action role-playing game|real-time combat]] system, where battles are a clash of energy between the party and the enemy, with the player needing to push the energy towards the enemy to strike them, while being able to use a shield to block or a suction ability to absorb the opponent's power. The game also improves upon the conversation system of its predecessor and more closely resembles the one in ''[[Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei]]'' released around the same time.<ref name=HG-101/>
