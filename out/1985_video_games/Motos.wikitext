{{nihongo|'''''Motos'''''|モトス|Motosu}} is an [[arcade game]] that was released by [[Namco]] on September 20, 1985.<ref>[http://www.vazcomics.org/mamend/M/motos.htm Motos at MamEnd]</ref> It runs on [[Namco Super Pac-Man]] hardware but with a video system like that used in ''[[Mappy]]'', ''[[The Tower of Druaga]]'', ''[[Grobda]]'' (without the [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]]) and ''[[Dig Dug II]]''.

==Gameplay==

The player must take control of the eponymous Motos, a bumper car whose goal is to force enemies over the edge of the playfield by bumping up against them; however, all the enemies are capable of doing exactly the same thing to it. "Power parts" and "jump parts" can also be collected during the 62 rounds, which will give Motos extra bumping power and the ability to jump over gaps in the playfield.



==Ports==
The game was ported to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[ZX Spectrum]], and was also released in 1998 as part of ''[[Microsoft Arcade|Microsoft Revenge of Arcade]]'' for Windows [[Personal computers|PCs]] - the first known appearance of the arcade version in North America. More recently, the game was released in 2005 as part of ''[[Namco Museum Battle Collection]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]], as well as ''[[Namco Museum Virtual Arcade]]'' for the [[Xbox 360]] on November 4, 2008. The game is also present in two ''Namco Museum'' compilations that were originally released exclusively in [[Japan]]: ''[[Namco Museum#Namco Museum Encore|Namco Museum Encore]]'' for the [[PlayStation]], in 1997, and ''[[Namco Museum Battle Collection|Namco Museum Volume 2]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]], in 2006. The latter also features an updated "Arrangement" version of the game (made in the spirit of the 6 original "Arrangements") with 3D graphics.

A "remixed" version of the game featuring Namco's signature character, [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], was released as part of ''[[Namco Museum Remix]]'' under the name of ''Pac-Motos'' - and ''[[Namco Museum Megamix]]'' also included the original game along with the remix.
