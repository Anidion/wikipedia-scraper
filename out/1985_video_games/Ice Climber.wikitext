{{nihongo foot|'''''Ice Climber'''''|アイスクライマー|Aisu Kuraimā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[platform game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]].  It was released in 1985 for both the arcade [[Nintendo VS. System|VS. System]] and the Famicom / [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console.{{efn|One book says the North American arcade release was October 1984, although contemporary flyers are all from 1985.<ref name="NA">{{cite book |last1=Akagi |first1=Masumi |title=アーケードTVゲームリスト国内•海外編(1971-2005) |trans-title=Arcade TV Game List: Domestic • Overseas Edition (1971-2005) |date=October 13, 2006 |publisher=Amusement News Agency |language=ja |location=Japan |isbn=978-4990251215 |page=128 |url=https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005/page/n129}}</ref>}} The characters Popo and Nana, collectively known as the Ice Climbers, scale 32 vertically scrolling, ice-covered mountains to recover stolen vegetables from a giant [[condor]]. In some European countries, ''Ice Climber'' was bundled with the Nintendo Entertainment System.

The arcade version, {{nihongo foot|'''''VS. Ice Climber'''''|VSアイスクライマー|VS Aisu Kuraimā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, has an animated [[title screen (gaming)|title screen]], a stage select menu at the start of the game and between levels, 16 more mountains, occasional blizzard and wind effects, more enemy characters, and bonus multiplier [[item (gaming)|items]].

Nana and Popo are playable characters in the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], starting with the 2001 game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' for the [[GameCube]]. Nintendo released the NES version for the [[Game Boy Advance]] through the [[Nintendo e-Reader]] in 2002.

==Gameplay==
[[File:NES Ice Climber.png|left|thumb|Popo scales Mountain 1 surrounded by Topis<!-- "Topis" is the correct plural of "Topi". Reference: "http://www.nintendo.com/wii/virtualconsole/games/detail/P32v6Gw7R3ONW25Fy0Xv9zqlWFJwIZ0d" --> and a Nitpicker.]]
The first player controls Popo, a boy wearing a blue [[parka]], while the second player controls Nana, a girl wearing a pink one. The only tool they carry is a wooden [[mallet]] to carve openings in the ice above and to club enemies. Each mountain [[level (video games)|level]] consists of eight layers of colorful ice and a [[bonus stage]]. Standard, dull ice blocks pose no threat other than an easily disposed-of barrier and platform. Square ice blocks with higher detail are indestructible, forcing the player to take another path. [[Hatching|Hatched]] ice acts as a [[conveyor belt]] sliding Popo or Nana either left or right. Finally, many mountains include unbreakable moving platforms resembling clouds. The bonus stage takes place at the peak. Within a 40-second time limit and no enemies, the Ice Climbers often face trickier jumps and multiple moving platforms. The peak is also the only place to recover stolen vegetables, most notably eggplants. Collecting just one piece of corn from the fifth bonus stage is the only way to gain an [[Life (video games)#Extra lives|extra life]].<ref>{{Cite book|year=1985|title=Ice Climber|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAAUE.pdf|publisher=Nintendo|type=Instruction manual}}</ref> At the top of the peak, the [[Condor]] flies overhead.

Enemies encountered on the way up the mountains include the Topi, Nitpicker, and [[Polar bear|White Bear]]. Topis come in two varieties: the blue [[Pinniped|seal]] featured in the Japanese Famicom ''Ice Climber'' release and the short [[Yeti]]-like creatures seen in Western versions and ''VS. Ice Climber''. Topis have the ability to fill in holes in the floor with ice. To do this, a Topi scouts out an opening in the floor, runs back to its cave, and reemerges pushing an icicle to fill in two blocks. This process repeats until no more openings on their layer of ice exist. The Nitpicker is a small, mountain-dwelling bird that swoops down from icy caves on the levels' edges. Unlike the Topi, which is confined to one floor of the mountain, Nitpickers can cross over multiple ice layers. Taking them into account along with moving platforms and sliding ice, timing jumps can be more difficult. The final enemy is the White Bear. This enemy, wearing sunglasses and pink speedo, appears on screen only when Popo and Nana take too long to advance. Pounding the ice, the Polar Bear forces the screen to move up. If Nana or Popo are forced off the screen, the player loses a life.

Other obstacles include deadly falling icicles. These can form on the bottom of any type of platform. After a few successful mountains climbed, all enemies' speeds increase.

The arcade game ''VS. Ice Climber'' has a few more gameplay differences. The player must pick from an initial set of 24 mountains to conquer. After eight are cleared, a Super Bonus stage occurs in which the player must reach a high platform. Afterwards, the player must choose from the second set of 24 mountains, in which the Condor is replaced by a giant butterfly. After the next eight stages are cleared and the Super Bonus is over, the player resumes the cycle from the original mountain set. The game keeps track of whether the mountain was claimed by an Ice Climber or if it remains Topi territory—once all the stages are completed, the counter resets. Approximately 30 of the 48 level designs are borrowed from the NES game. Stage setups are generally trickier in ''VS. Ice Climber'', with some new mechanics such as cloud platforms that move diagonally or strong gusts of wind. A purple bee with a spear flying in a horizontal pattern is included as a somewhat rare fourth enemy.

After the bonus stage, the players' [[Score (game)|scores]] are tallied. Points are rewarded for every brick of ice destroyed, every Topi-pushed icicle smashed, every Nitpicker killed and every vegetable collected. Finally, a bonus score is rewarded if a player manages to climb to the top of the bonus stage and jump up and grab the Condor. The game keeps track of the high score, although there is no way to save it on the NES version.

The game can be played in one- or two-player mode. The latter places Popo and Nana against each other in a race to the summit. Players may prefer to [[Cooperative video game|play cooperatively]] on the way up, but during the bonus round, they must compete for the top.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=June 2023}}
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''VS. Ice Climbers'' in its April 1, 1985, issue as the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=257|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=April 1, 1985|page=25|lang=ja}}{{Circular reference|date=September 2021}}</ref> Former President of Finland [[Mauno Koivisto]] was reportedly keen on Nintendo games and his son-in-law has reported that ''Ice Climber'' was his favorite game.<ref>"Uutuuskirja: Mauno Koivisto hullaantui 30 vuotta sitten videopeleihin ja kyykytti kavereitaan Nintendolla: 'Etkö sä oikein hallitse tätä?'", on September 26, 2019, Ilta-Sanomat, https://www.is.fi/tv-ja-elokuvat/art-2000006251088.html</ref>

Reviewing the American release, ''[[Computer Entertainer]]'' magazine called it "addictive" for fans of climbing games. The reviewer awarded 3.5 out of 4 stars, for both categories of graphics and gameplay, adding that it provide "hours of challenging play".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Video Game Update|magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]]|volume=5|issue=1|page=11|date=April 1986|url=https://retrocdn.net/images/5/5e/ComputerEntertainer_US_Vol.5_01.pdf#page=11}}</ref>

Popo and Nana appear in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series of fighting game as a two-in-one playable fighter under the name Ice Climbers, voiced by [[Sanae Kobayashi]]. Appearing in 2001's ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee|Melee]]'', and 2008's ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]'', their return was planned for [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']], but technical issues with the 3DS version required game director [[Masahiro Sakurai]] to scrap development on them to maintain parity between the two versions. He said that there was not a high priority to include them because the ''Ice Climber'' series was "unlikely to have another installment" at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nintendoeverything.com/sakurai-addresses-ice-climbers-absence-in-smash-bros-wii-u3ds-and-more-in-new-famitsu-column/|title=Sakurai addresses Ice Climbers' absence in Smash Bros.
