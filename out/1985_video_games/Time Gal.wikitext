{{nihongo foot|'''''Time Gal'''''|タイムギャル|Taimu Gyaru|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[interactive movie]] video game developed and published by [[Taito]] and [[Toei Company]], and originally released as a [[laserdisc game]] in Japan for the [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1985. It is an [[action game]] which uses [[full motion video]] (FMV) to display the on-screen action. The player must correctly choose the on-screen character's actions to progress the story. The pre-recorded animation for the game was produced by [[Toei Company]].

The game is set in a fictional future where [[time travel]] is possible. The protagonist, Reika, travels to different time periods in search of a criminal, Luda, from her time. After successfully tracking down Luda, Reika prevents his plans to alter the past. ''Time Gal'' was inspired by the success of earlier laserdisc video games that used pre-recorded animation, including ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'' (1983) and the previous Taito/Toei collaboration ''[[Ninja Hayate]]'' (1984), while Reika's character design bears similarities to the [[anime]] characters [[Lum (Urusei Yatsura)|Lum]] (from ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'') and Yuri (from ''[[Dirty Pair]]'').

The game was later [[Porting|ported]] to the [[Sega CD]] for a worldwide release, and also to the [[LaserActive]] in Japan. The Sega CD version received a generally favorable reception from critics.

==Gameplay==
''Time Gal'' is an [[interactive movie]] game that uses [[Full motion video|pre-recorded animation]] rather than [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] to display the on-screen action. Gameplay is divided into [[Level (video games)|levels]], referred to as time periods. The game begins in 3001 [[Anno Domini|AD]] with the theft of a time travel device. The thief, Luda, steals the device to take over the world by changing history. Reika, the protagonist also known as Time Gal, uses her own time travel device to pursue him; she travels to different time periods, such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario that presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period.<ref name="GF-1-5">{{cite magazine | magazine = [[GameFan]] | publisher = DieHard Gamers Club| title = Time Gal|date=April 1993| volume = 1| issue = 5| page = 35 | url = https://archive.org/details/GamefanVolume1Issue05April1993ALT/page/n34}}</ref><ref name="KLOV">{{cite web| url = http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10116| title = Time Gal Videogame by Taito (1985)| publisher = [[Killer List of Videogames]]| access-date = 2009-05-29}}</ref><ref name="AllGame">{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1448 |title=Time Gal - Overview |publisher=[[AllGame]] |first=Jonathan |last=Sutyak |access-date=2009-05-29 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114223418/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1448 |archive-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

The player uses a joystick and button to input commands, though home versions use a [[game controller]] with a [[directional pad]]. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted portions of the background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on the location of the cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a [[game over]].<ref name="AllGame"/><ref name="MightHaveBeen">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/11/column_might_have_been_time_ga.php| title = Column: 'Might Have Been' - Time Gal| date = 2008-11-13| publisher = GameSetWatch| first = Todd| last = Ciolek| access-date = 2009-05-29| archive-date = 2016-03-04| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030548/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/11/column_might_have_been_time_ga.php| url-status = dead}}</ref> Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time.

==Release==
Since its original release to the arcades in Japan in 1985, ''Time Gal'' has been ported to different home formats. It was first released exclusively in Japan by [[JVC|Nippon Victor]] on the [[Video High Density]] format. The release of [[Sega CD]] console in 1991 spawned numerous games that took advantage of the CD technology to introduce interactive FMVs. Among the new titles, ''Time Gal'' was one of several older laserdisc-based games that were ported to the system.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p6.html| title = IGN Presents the History of SEGA| first = Travis| last = Fahs| publisher = IGN| date = 2009-04-21| access-date = 2009-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/04/the-lives-and-deaths-of-the-interactive-movie?page=3| title = The Lives and Deaths of the Interactive Movie (Page 3)| first = Travis| last = Fahs| date = 2008-03-03| publisher = IGN| access-date = 2009-05-29}}</ref> [[Renovation Products]] acquired the rights to publish ''Time Gal'' on the Sega CD, with [[Wolf Team]] handling development.<ref name="GF-1-5"/> They released it, along with similar games, as part of their "Action-Reaction" series.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine= [[Sega Visions]]| publisher = Infotainment World| title = Time Gal Overview| page =53| issue = 12|date=April–May 1993}}</ref> It was first released in Japan in November 1992, and in North America and Europe the next year.<ref name="GS-Release">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/segacd/action/timegal/similar.html?mode=versions| title = Time Gal for Sega CD| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| access-date = 2009-05-29}}</ref> A [[Macintosh]] version was also released in Japan in 1994.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.mobygames.com/game/macintosh/time-gal| title = Time Gal for Macintosh (1994)| publisher = [[Mobygames]]| access-date = 2018-03-14}}</ref>

''[[GamePro]]'' magazine noted that "Japanese players ate it up" when it first released in Japanese arcades.<ref name="GP-45"/> However, [[Gamasutra#GameSetWatch|GameSetWatch]]'s Todd Ciolek believed it was released too late in the life of LaserDisc games, and that players "were getting tired" of the genre's gameplay. He further commented that, despite its gameplay, it was unique and charming.<ref name="MightHaveBeen"/> ''GamePro''{{'}}s reviewer referred to the arcade game as a "lost, laserdisc treasure", and was enthusiastic about its Sega CD release. He called the death sequences "hilarious" and felt they reduced the tediousness of dying.<ref name="GP-45"/> ''[[Mega (magazine)|MEGA]]'' magazine rated the Sega CD version the number five CD game, commenting that though it lacked difficulty, it was a good showcase of the system.<ref name="Mega-8-Top10">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Mega (magazine)|MEGA]]| title = Top Ten CD Games| publisher = [[Future plc|Future Publishing]]| page =89| issue = 8|date=May 1993}}</ref> Prior to its Sega CD release, ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' praised the use of CD technology and felt it would be followed by titles with similar gameplay.<ref name="EGM-40">{{cite magazine|magazine= [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]| publisher = [[Ziff Davis]]| title = International Outlook: Time Gal| page =68| issue = 40|date=November 1992}}</ref>

Critics praised ''Time Gal''{{'}}s visuals. ''[[GameFan]]'' magazine, in praising Wolf Team's port of the game, complimented the Sega CD version's graphics and short load times.<ref name="GF-1-5"/> ''GamePro'' said the animation is "great, with bright, vivid colors, and fast-paced, exciting movement" and praised the "funny gameplay" and "nonstop action".<ref name="GP58">{{cite magazine |magazine= [[GamePro]] | title = Sega CD ProReview: Time Gal | author = The Tummynator | issue = 58 | page =64|date=July 1993|url=https://archive.org/details/GamePro_Issue_048_July_1993/page/n64/mode/1up}}</ref> Chris Bieniek of ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'' criticized the story as "nonsensical" and said that while the unlockable video gallery is a nice feature, it effectively eliminates any replay value, which compounds the easiness of the game to give it very low longevity. He nonetheless recommended ''Time Gal'', based chiefly on the gameplay: "Though you never really feel like you're in control of Time Gal's movements, the zany action has an undeniable appeal that takes up a lot of the slack."<ref name=VGE52/> Shawn Sackenheim of [[AllGame]] complimented the animation, calling it "high quality", but criticized the Sega CD graphics, calling them "downgraded". He commented that, though ''Time Gal'' offered a good thrill, it lacked replay value.<ref name="AG-Review"/> Ciolek echoed similar statements, saying it is more enjoyable to watch than to play. He further commented that the game is frustrating and rigid when compared to more contemporary standards.<ref name="MightHaveBeen"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s group of reviewers praised the Sega CD version's graphics quality. Three of the four reviewers lauded the gameplay, specifically the challenge and format. The other reviewer stated he didn't care for this type of game, referring to the gameplay as "nothing more than memorizing".<ref name="EGM-45-Review">{{cite magazine|magazine= [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]| publisher = [[Ziff Davis]]| title = Review Crew: Time Gal| page =30| issue = 45|date=April 1993|url=https://retrocdn.net/images/0/00/EGM_US_045.pdf}}</ref>

[[IGN]]'s Levi Buchanan listed interactive movie games like ''Time Gal'' as one of the reasons behind the Sega CD's commercial failure, citing them as a waste of the system's capabilities.<ref>{{cite podcast| url = http://retro.ign.com/articles/924/924626p1.html| title = RetroCity Podcast, Episode 16: The Sega CD and 32X| website = [[IGN]]| format = mp3| medium = Podcast| host = Levi Buchanan| date = 2008-10-28| access-date = 2009-05-29}}</ref> In describing the cinematic gameplay in the 2009 action game ''[[Ninja Blade]]'', producer Masanori Takeuchi attributed the [[quick time event]] game mechanic featured in his title to laserdisc games like ''Dragon's Lair'' and ''Time Gal''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20081013/nb.htm| script-title=ja:フロム・ソフトウェアイベントレポート| language=ja| last = Toyotomi| first = Kazutaka| publisher = Impress Watch| date = 2008-10-13| access-date = 2009-05-29}}</ref>

Todd Ciolek referred to the protagonist as one of the first human heroines in the industry. He further added that Reika was an appealing lead character that Taito could have easily turned into a mascot and featured in other games and media.<ref name="MightHaveBeen"/> The character was later included in [[Alfa System]]'s [[shoot 'em up|shooting game]] ''[[Castle of Shikigami III]]''—Taito published the arcade version in Japan.<ref name="MightHaveBeen"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://cheats.gamespy.com/arcade/shikigami-no-shiro-iii/| title = The Castle of Shikigami III - Arcade| publisher = [[GameSpy]]| access-date = 2009-05-29}}</ref> In the game, Reika features attacks and personality similar to her original debut as well as an updated visual design.<ref name="MightHaveBeen"/> Reika's also appeared in the 2011 ''[[Elevator Action]]'' remake ''Elevator Action Deluxe'' as one part of [[downloadable content]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.siliconera.com/2012/03/26/elevator-action-deluxe-returns-with-additional-stages/| title = Elevator Action Deluxe Returns With Additional Stages| date = 26 March 2012| publisher = Siliconera| access-date = 2012-06-08}}</ref>
