==Reception==
In 1986, ''[[Computer & Video Games]]'' magazine called ''Turbo Sub'', "One of the most bizarre trips you're likely to make".<ref name=cv86>{{cite journal |last1=Edgeley |first1=Clare |title=Arcade Action: Turbo Sub |journal=Computer and Video Games |date=April 1986 |issue=54 |page=86 |url=https://archive.org/details/computer-and-videogames-054/page/n85}}</ref> The reviewer praised how the experience is automatically adjusted based on the player's skill, so the game plays differently over time.<ref name=cv86/>

In a contemporaneous review for the Lynx version,<ref name="DPLYNXtb">{{cite magazine|last=Iida|first=Keita|url=https://archive.org/stream/Digital_Press_Issue_35_1998-01_Santulli_Joe_US#page/n16/mode/1up|title=Random Reviews Lite - Turbo Sub (Atari, for Lynx)|magazine=Digital Press - The Bio-Degradable Source For Videogamers|issue=35|publisher=Joe Santulli|date=January 1998|page=17}}</ref> Robert A. Jung concluded, "What ''Turbo Sub'' lacks in originality and variety, it makes up with blistering excitement. If you've got an appetite for simple, uncomplicated massive destruction at Mach 3, ''Turbo Sub'' is the way to go." He gave a score of 7.5 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jung |first1=Robert A. |title=LYNX: Turbo Sub |url=https://www.atariarchives.org/cfn/08/07/0017.php |website=atariarchives.org |date=September 29, 1991}}</ref> In the "Atari Attack" column in the final issue of ''Raze'' magazine, ''Turbo Sub'' received a score of 73%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/raze-magazine-12/Raze_12_Oct_1991#page/n23 |website=archive.org |title=Atari Attack |publisher=Raze|issue=12 |page=24 |date=October 1991 |accessdate=20 August 2018 }}</ref>
