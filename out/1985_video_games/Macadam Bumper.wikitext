'''''Macadam Bumper''''' (also released as '''''Pinball Wizard''''') is a video pinball simulation construction set developed by [[ERE Informatique]] in France. It was first released for 8-bit computers in 1985, the [[Atari ST]] in 1986 and [[MS-DOS]] in 1987. The Atari ST and MS-DOS versions were released in the [[United States|US]] as ''Pinball Wizard'' in 1988 by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]].

==Gameplay==
''Pinball Wizard'' is a game which includes sound and lights and the ability to [[Pinball#Nudging|tilt]], with different obstacles on each of the four pinball simulations. On the Atari ST, the player manipulates the flipper and back-board controls using the mouse, but too much movement from the mouse will activate the tilt sensors. Players can customize the parameters in the game including as point scores, table slope, bumper elasticity, and the number of balls per game. Using a parts menu, the player can assemble a pinball machine, coloring and decorating it from the paint menu.
