'''''Winter Games''''' is a [[sport]]s [[video game]] developed by [[Epyx]] (and released in [[Europe]] by [[U.S. Gold]]), based on sports featured in the [[Winter Olympic Games]].

A snow-and-ice themed follow-up to the highly successful ''[[Summer Games (video game)|Summer Games]]'', ''Winter Games'' was released in 1985 for the [[Commodore 64]] and later ported to several popular [[home computer]]s and [[video game console]]s of the 1980s.

The game was presented as a virtual multi-sport carnival called the "Epyx Winter Games" (there was no official [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] licensing in place) with up to 8 players each choosing a country to represent, and then taking turns competing in various events to try for a medal.

==Events==
The events available vary slightly depending on the platform, but include some or all of the following:
* [[Slalom skiing]]
* [[Ski jumping]]<ref name="Commodore User Magazine Issue 26">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-user-magazine-26/page/n25/mode/2up?view=theater|title = Commodore User Magazine Issue 26|date = November 1985}}</ref>
* [[Biathlon]]<ref name="Impossible to Display Scan">{{Cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=007&amp;page=104&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap&amp;check=1|title = Impossible to Display Scan}}</ref>

* [[Freestyle skiing]]; more precisely, the aerial skiing discipline, called "Hot Dog Aerials" in the game<ref name="Impossible to Display Scan"/>
* [[Free skating]]<ref name="Commodore User Magazine Issue 26"/>

The game allows players to compete in all of the events sequentially, choose a few events, choose just one event, or practice an event.

''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'' rated ''Winter Games'' four-plus stars out of five, stating that each event was good enough to be sold separately, and concluding that it was "sports simulation at its best!".<ref name="info198601">{{Cite magazine | last1=Dunnington | first1=Benn | last2=Brown | first2=Mark R. | date=December 1985 – January 1986 | url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-09/Info_Issue_09_1985_Dec-Jan_1986#page/n5/mode/2up | title=C-64/128 Gallery | magazine=Info | pages=4–5, 88–93 | access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref> In 1985, ''[[Zzap!64]]'' gave 94% for the game calling it "another classic sport simulation from Epyx".

The Angry Video Game Nerd reviewed the NES version of the game in December 2009. In it, he calls the game's controls some of the worst in a game ever.

In 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' listed the "Games" series collectively as number 89 on its "Top 100 Games of All Time". The magazine wrote that though the games had great graphics for their time, their most defining qualities were their competitive multiplayer modes and "level of control that has yet to be equaled".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 100 Games of All Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=September 1996|page=39}}</ref>
