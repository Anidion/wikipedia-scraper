==Gameplay and Plot==
The queen of the cosmic wartoads has been kidnapped by the Rygellian Slime Beasts, turned into a human and is being held captive beneath the Slime King's Sludge Saw, which descends over the course of ninety minutes and will kill her if it is not stopped.

The player controls the Cosmic Wartoad as he attempts to rescue the queen. To achieve this he must travel across the Rygellian Timevoid, an 8x8 grid of [[Vertex (graph theory)|"nodes"]], by entering a node, successfully completing the [[minigame]] within, and then entering an adjacent node, all the while collecting the eight pieces of the Cosmic Toolkit that will shut down the Sludge Saw. Each node contains one of several repeating minigames, which typically involve the Cosmic Wartoad fighting enemies.

The game finishes either when the Cosmic Wartoad successfully collects all eight pieces of the Toolkit and navigates his way across the grid to shut down the saw; when the Cosmic Wartoad loses all of his three [[health (gaming)|lives]]; or when the ninety-minute game period expires.<ref name='CrashReview'>{{cite news | title = Cosmic Wartoad | date = March 1986 | publisher = [[Newsfield Publications]] | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue26/Pages/Crash2600137.jpg | work = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] | pages = 137 | accessdate = 2011-07-27}}</ref><ref name='SUReview'>{{cite news | first = Chris | last = Bourne | title = Cosmic Wartoad | date = March 1986 | publisher = [[EMAP]] | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue048/Pages/SinclairUser04800049.jpg | work = [[Sinclair User]] | pages = 49 | accessdate = 2011-07-27}}</ref>
