'''''Battle of Britain''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] video game developed and published by [[Personal Software Services]] for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1985. It was also ported to the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] the next year. It is the seventh instalment to the ''Strategic Wargames'' series. The game is set during the [[Battle of Britain]] campaign of the [[Second World War]] and revolves around Britain's defence and prevention against [[Operation Sea Lion|a Nazi invasion]]. In the game, the player commands the [[Royal Air Force]] as they must defend key cities against the [[Luftwaffe]].

The game contains elements of [[first-person shooter|first-person shooting]]; during some sequences the game requires a certain number of aircraft to be shot down. ''Battle of Britain'' received mixed to positive reviews from critics upon release. Critics praised the fast pace of the gameplay and features, however, one reviewer was divided over the historical accuracy of the battle.

The game is a [[turn-based strategy]] and focuses on air battles during the [[Battle of Britain]] campaign of the [[Second World War]]. The player commands squadrons of the [[Royal Air Force]] and the main objective of the game is to defend key cities and radar installations from the [[Luftwaffe]]. Unlike previous games in the series, ''Battle of Britain'' is the first to include [[cursor (user interface)|cursor movement]], a scrolling interface and elements of [[first-person shooter]] gameplay.<ref name=YS/> At the start of the game, the player is given the option of how many RAF squadrons they wish to allocate for offensive and defensive purposes; a proportionate amount must be sent to attack Luftwaffe squadrons whilst the others will be left to defend key cities from [[The Blitz|air raids]].<ref name=YS/>

The game has three individual scenarios; training mode, [[Blitzkrieg]] mode, and campaign mode. Training mode is set on the lowest difficulty and allows the player to finish the game by using any strategy over an indefinite period of time.<ref name=YS/><ref name=crash/> Blitzkrieg mode only lasts one in-game day and features the Luftwaffe going out for an "all-out" attack simultaneously on every target and city.<ref name=crash/> The campaign mode takes place over a period of 30 days and is set on the highest difficulty.<ref name=YS/> In addition, the campaign mode features historically accurate movements and strategies used by both the RAF and Luftwaffe.<ref name=crash/>

[[File:Battle of Britain gameplay 2.jpg|thumb|right|The game contains elements of [[first-person shooter|first-person shooting]]. In this sequence, a [[Spitfire]] attempts to destroy a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]].]]

At the start of the game, a wave of Luftwaffe aircraft (in the appearance of ''[[Balkenkreuz]]'' sprites on the map) will cross the [[English Channel]] and proceed to bomb various cities, air bases and [[airborne interception radar|radar installations]].<ref name=SU/> In response, RAF squadrons are automatically scrambled and will await orders to either engage invading Luftwaffe fighters or to defend key cities from bombers.<ref name=crash/> When a RAF squadron has successfully engaged a Luftwaffe unit on the map, the game will shift to a first-person shooter perspective, in which the point of view is portrayed from a cockpit of either a [[Spitfire]] or [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], depending on the side chosen.<ref name=SU/> During the [[dogfight]] sequence, the number of Luftwaffe casualties will depend on how many aircraft the player was able to shoot down.<ref name=crash/>

The game features a changing weather system, which will vary from every hour and will provide obstructions for various forces and installations. For example, [[fog]] will close runways whereas storms will temporarily disrupt bombing runs and dogfights.<ref name=SU/> Over time, RAF squadrons will run out of ammunition or fuel, and thus must replenish at the nearest RAF station, which will render them vulnerable to a Luftwaffe bombing run.<ref name=CVG/> In between turns, the player has the opportunity to request reinforcements from RAF reserves, however the longer the campaign progresses, the quality of the reserves will diminish.<ref name=crash/>

The game received mixed to positive reviews from critics upon release. Gwyn Hughes of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' praised the game's fast pace and tempo of gameplay, stating it to be "fast and furious".

A reviewer of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' stated that the game "isn't very good", nor the best Battle of Britain recreation on the market, and criticised on how interceptions were "far too easy" to make.<ref name=CVG>{{cite journal|title=Battle of Britain review (CVG)|journal=Computer and Video Games|date=August 1987|issue=70|page=56|url=https://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue070/Pages/CVG07000056.jpg|access-date=13 October 2015}}</ref> Reviewing the ZX Spectrum version of the game, a critic from ''[[ACE (games magazine)|Advanced Computer Entertainment]]'' cited the game as historically inaccurate due to it lasting only 30 days, whereas the actual Battle of Britain was considerably longer. However, they praised the gameplay as an "enjoyable challenge" and a good value for money.<ref name=ACE>{{cite journal|title=Battle of Britain review|journal=Advanced Computer Entertainment|date=December 1987|issue=3|url=https://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-03/ACE_Issue_03_1987_Dec#page/n85/mode/1up|access-date=11 October 2015|publisher=Future plc}}</ref>

The game was a runner-up for the 1985 Strategy Game of the Year at the [[Golden Joystick Awards]].<ref name="GJA">{{cite magazine |title=Golden Joystick Awards |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=May 1986 |issue=55 |pages=90â€“91 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_055_1986-05_EMAP_Publishing_GB/page/n89/mode/2up |publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref>
