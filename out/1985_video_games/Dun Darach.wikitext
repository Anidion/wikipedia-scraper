It is a [[prequel]] to the 1984 game ''[[Tir Na Nog (game)|Tir Na Nog]]''. The plot has [[Celt]]ic hero [[Cuchulainn]] on a search to find his companion [[Lóeg]] in the mysterious city of Dun Darach. Inspiration for the game came from the works of [[Fritz Leiber]] and [[Michael Moorcock]].

The background history is based on Celtic folklore about the [[demigod]] Cuchulainn and his battles against the people of [[Connachta]] in ancient [[Ireland]]. ''Dun Darach'' was critically acclaimed upon its original release, with praise singling out its graphics. Retrospective reviews were less than positive, with one reviewer preferring ''Tir Na Nog''. It was re-released on different game compilations and [[Covermount|cover tapes]] in issues of British video game magazines.

==Plot and gameplay==
[[File:Dun Darach gameplay.png|left|thumb|Gameplay of ''Dun Darach'']]
One day [[Cuchulainn]] travels home with his charioteer companion [[Lóeg]] from a battle against the [[Connachta]]. On the way, they stop off at an [[inn]] and Lóeg is persuaded to help a young woman named Skar, whose [[chariot]] is damaged. Cuchulainn realizes that Lóeg is missing after taking refreshment at the inn. He later discovers that Skar is a sorceress and ally of the Connachta, and has taken Lóeg to the Secret City of Dun Darach in retribution for the death of Prince Amhair, who perished in the battle. Cuchulainn goes on a long search for the mysterious city, eventually discovering it and entering to find Lóeg.<ref name=Crash1/>

''Dun Darach'' is an [[arcade adventure]] video game. The player guides Cuchulainn through Dun Darach and interacts with the environment by performing [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] commands. The main objective is to find Lóeg, taking [[side quests]] from [[non-player character]]s (NPCs). These NPCs can give short hints to Cuchulainn, rob him, and confiscate his belongings if he carries stolen goods. Commands the player inputs can have him buy, steal and sell from shops in the city, bet at a casino (Iomain Ludum), and deposit money at a bank with daily [[compound interest]]. Dun Darach is large and consists of different quarters. The current time of the day is indicated by torches in the wall and by the greetings of characters.<ref name="gameplaymanual">{{cite book|year=1986|title=Dun Darach instruction manual|publisher=Gargoyle Games}}</ref>

==Development and release==
''Dun Darach'' was developed by Greg Follis and Roy Carter, the co-founders of game developer [[Gargoyle Games]], as a prequel to their previous title, [[Tir Na Nog (video game)|''Tir Na Nog'']]. It had the working title ''Cú Chulainn – The Early Years''.<ref name=Micro>{{cite magazine|magazine=Micro Adventurer|title=Gargoyle|date=February 1985|page=7|issue=16|url=https://archive.org/stream/micro-adventurer-16/Micro_Adventurer_Issue_16_1985_Feb#page/n6/mode/2up}}</ref> Development first began on 10 February 1985.<ref name=SUser1>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Sinclair User]]|title=The Gargoyle Speaks|last=Bourne|first=Chris|pages=112–115|issue=44|date=November 1985|url=https://archive.org/details/sinclair-user-magazine-044/page/n111}}</ref> Follis claimed that the biggest complaint for ''Tir Na Nog'' was its huge setting, resulting in it being scaled back to one city.<ref name=Micro/> Inspiration for ''Dun Darach'' came from the works of [[Fritz Leiber]] and [[Michael Moorcock]],<ref name=SUser/> with Gargoyle wanting the atmosphere to be similar to Leiber's book ''[[The Swords of Lankhmar]]''.<ref name=Micro/> It was showcased at the LET trade show at the [[Olympia London]], showing screenshots of the game.<ref name=PCW>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Popular Computing Weekly]]|title=LET Show Report|page=4|volume=4|number=8|date=21–27 February 1985|url=https://archive.org/details/popular-computing-weekly-1985-02-21/page/n3}}</ref>

One area had to be censored before release. There is an empty area in the centre of the city, the pleasure quarter "Iomain" which was originally intended to be a [[brothel]] called "Lady Q's" and would have opened into a whole [[red-light district]]. This was replaced with a sign saying "Forbidden".<ref name=SUser1/> ''Dun Darach'' was launched for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1985. It was ported to the [[Amstrad CPC]] later that year. Carter remarked that it took ten days to do the conversion for the system.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Amstrad Action]]|title=Special|page=14|date=October 1985|issue=1|url=https://archive.org/details/amstrad-action-001/page/n13}}</ref> It was re-released by different software companies; [[Hewson Consultants]]' Rebound [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]] in 1986, [[Gremlin Graphics]] in 1986 as part of their ''4 Crash Smashes'' compilation, and on [[Covermount|cover tapes]] in issues of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' and ''[[Your Sinclair]]''.<ref name=HG101>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dun-darach/|title=Dun Darach|last=Jankiewicz|first=Joshua|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=8 August 2015|access-date=7 January 2020|archive-date=8 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200108154029/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dun-darach/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Marks also noted the novelty of the graphics wore off.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/dun-darach/ |title=''Dun Darach'' |last=Marks |first=Ian |work=[[Retro Gamer]] |date=20 January 2009 |access-date=8 January 2020 |archive-date=20 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020061432/https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/dun-darach/ |url-status=live}}</ref>
