'''''The Rats''''' is a [[survival horror]] [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] computers. It is based on the 1974  novel  ''[[The Rats (novel)|The Rats]]'' by [[James Herbert]]. The game was programmed by GXT (Five Ways Software),<ref name=crafrt /> and published by [[Hodder & Stoughton]], who were the publishers of James Herbert's book ''The Rats''.<ref name=sinuse /> An [[Amstrad CPC]] version was planned, but was never released.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==Gameplay==
The game is  a simulation that allows the player to strategically send emergency forces (rat exterminators, police men, fire men and eventually army troops) to areas where the rat threat has spread and provide them with equipment. Also the player can get ten available researchers to develop addition weapons, defences and super weapons to keep the rats at bay and to provide useful information to progress in the game. Should the rat threat reach beyond the London limits, the Research centre, the Government centre or Harris' apartment or if all emergency forces are lost, the game is over.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mocagh.org/miscgame/rats-manual.pdf |title=James Herbert's The Rats |work=[[Hodder & Stoughton]]}}</ref>

In between the simulation gameplay, the game suddenly switches to the role of a playable character in a randomly chosen text adventure scenario. The player has to select one or more verbal options to perform actions to allow the character to survive against the rat threat and avoid getting killed. While it is not crucial to keep the characters alive, saving them grants the player additional reinforcements and research to aid against the rat threat. However, if one of the main characters Harris, Howard or Foskins dies, the game is over.<ref name=crafrt />
