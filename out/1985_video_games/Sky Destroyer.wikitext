{{nihongo|'''''Sky Destroyer'''''|スカイデストロイヤー|Sukai Desutoroiyā}} is a [[rail shooter]] video game released by [[Taito]] in 1985 as an [[arcade game]] as well as for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]]. Controlling a Japanese World War II monoplane, the player assumes the role of the pilot of the respective naval aircraft who is required to destroy enemies to clear stages.

==Gameplay==

In ''Sky Destroyer'', the player controls a plane, equipped with machine guns and torpedoes and ammunition is unlimited.

The color of the sky changes according to the time of the day (afternoon, evening, night). [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F Hellcat]]s ([[F4U Corsair]]s in the Arcade Version) are common enemy fighter planes the player will encounter. Occasionally, the  player would run into a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]] bomber and has to shoot each of its four engines before the B-24 flies away. Sometimes when player has shot down a number of B-24s, they would encounter a falling satellite across the screen. A high number of points would be rewarded if the satellite gets destroyed. There are bonus stages in this game.

Enemy resistance comes not only from the air, but from land and sea as well. Sometimes, an American naval destroyer or submarine would try to down the player's plane with anti-aircraft fire. Aircraft carriers can sometimes be seen in the distant horizon (but can still be sunk with torpedoes). At the end of a stage, the player faces a mobile shore battery on an island. This battery must be destroyed in order to complete the mission. If the player is hit even just once by enemy fire, his plane crashes and he loses one life point.<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/sky-destroyer ''Sky Destroyer''] at [[MobyGames]]</ref> The game is over when all life points are used up.

==''Sky Invader''==

A hacked version of this game made by Inventor is known as ''Sky Invader''. The differences between the original and the hacked version are:
*Different title screen.
*Different music.
*Different planes (both the player's and the enemies are modified).
*The sky is pink.
*The water color is different.
*The player starts with nine airplanes instead of three.
*The stages are called "WAR".

== Reception ==
