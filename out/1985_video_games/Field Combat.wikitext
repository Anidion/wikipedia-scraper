{{nihongo|'''''Field Combat'''''|フィールドコンバット|Firudo Konbatto}} is a 1985 [[shooter video game]] developed and published by [[Jaleco]] for [[Arcade video game|arcades]]. In ''Field Combat'', the player fights as a [[commanding officer]] in a [[futuristic]] battlefield. It was ported to the Famicom by [[Tose (company)|Tose]], which was later re-released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2007. A sequel game, ''Field Combat DX'', was released for Japanese mobile phones in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title=フィールドコンバットDX |url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/games/gsnews/0311/21/news13.html |website=IT Media |accessdate=9 December 2018}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to make it all the way to the end of the [[wikt:battlefield|battlefield]] using the Genesis (not to be confused with a [[Sega Genesis|North American video game console of the same name]]); a warship that can fire off missiles. While the player controls the blue forces, the player must defeat the red forces without dying in the process by either avoiding or shooting [[helicopter]]s, [[infantry]]men, and [[tank]]s. An interesting characteristic of the game is that it is possible to ask for reinforcements from an army, which the player possesses, by pressing both the A and B buttons at the same time. The player can also use their special weapon to "absorb" the enemies and add them to their army. There is also an enemy [[unidentified flying object|UFO]] like spaceship that, when in battlefield, attempts to grab and escape with a player friendly unit (if there is any on the battlefield). It will also engage into air-to-air battle with a friendly helicopter (if there is any).

The game used classical music such as [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]'' as its background music.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Field Combat'' on their April 15, 1985 issue as being the ninth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref name="GM258">{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=258|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 April 1985|page=19|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19850415p.pdf#page=10}}</ref>

''[[Computer Gamer]]'' reviewed the arcade game, noting the gameplay is similar to [[Taito]]'s ''[[Front Line (video game)|Front Line]]'' (1982) from several years earlier and stating it is "quite good but very difficult to get the initial hang of".<ref name="CG3">{{cite magazine |last1=Roberts |first1=Mike |title=Coin-Op Connection |magazine=[[Computer Gamer]] |date=June 1985 |issue=3 |publisher=[[Argus Press]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=18–9 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_03_1985-06_Argus_Press_GB/page/n17/mode/2up}}</ref>
