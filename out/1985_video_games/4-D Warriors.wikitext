The players take control of two [[Jet pack|jetpack]]-propelled [[Space marine|space warriors]] who travel between [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universes]] and [[wormhole|worm holes]] (hence 4-D or 4 dimensions) throughout the game. Flying over the top of the play field will transport the players to an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate universe]]. The players can travel back and forth defeating enemies until they reach a boss creature. On some occasions a worm hole will appear in the middle of the play field and the players are taken to even stranger worlds.
