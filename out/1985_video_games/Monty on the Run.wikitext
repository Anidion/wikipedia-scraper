'''''Monty on the Run''''' is a [[computer game]] created by the [[software house]] [[Gremlin Graphics]] and released in 1985 for the [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Commodore 16]], written by Peter Harrap for the [[ZX Spectrum]] with the iconic in-game music on the Commodore 64 provided by [[Rob Hubbard]]. It is the third game in the ''[[Wanted: Monty Mole|Monty Mole]]'' series.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Monty_on_the_Run_Commodore_64_Gameplay_Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Commodore 64 version screenshot]]
On the run from the [[Policing in the United Kingdom|authorities]] after his [[Wanted: Monty Mole|intervention]] in the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|Miners' strike]], Monty the [[Mole (animal)|mole]] must escape from his house and head for the [[English Channel]] and freedom in [[Continental Europe|Europe]]. In traditional [[platform game]] fashion, along the way he needs to collect various objects and solve puzzles to complete his escape. Before the game, five objects must be chosen to form Monty's Freedom Kit. Choosing the wrong items will leave the player unable to pass certain screens.<ref name=zzap /> This also acted as an anti-piracy measure, since the objects were only given numbers onscreen meaning the player had to refer to the accompanying manual.<ref name=zzap /> The final screen sees Monty boarding a ferry to France. This was then the starting point for the follow-up ''[[Auf Wiedersehen Monty]]''.

The game has a sense of British surrealness similar to ''[[Manic Miner]]'' and ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'' - in gameplay it is more similar to the latter. Enemies patrol every screen, water is deadly to the touch and Monty runs the risk of being squashed by the many pistons.

==Ports==
The [[Commodore 64]] version was produced by Micro Projects Ltd, joint owned by Anthony Clarke and Jason Perkins, with graphical input by Mark Rodgers and music by [[Rob Hubbard]]. The music for the Commodore 64 version is regarded as one of the best computer game scores for that platform. The main game theme was, according to Hubbard, inspired by "[[Devil's Galop]]", the theme tune to the radio serial [[Dick Barton]]. It was rated #2 in ''Hardcore Gaming 101's'' Top 100 Western Video Game Music of all time.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Best Western Video Game Music of All Time - 2011 |url=http://hardcoregaming101.net/vgm/wvgm2011.htm |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103183500/http://hardcoregaming101.net/vgm/wvgm2011.htm |archive-date=January 3, 2012 |date=December 23, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

A remake, titled {{nihongo|'''''Monty's Great Heart-pounding Escape'''''|モンティのドキドキ大脱走|Monti no Doki Doki Dai Dassō}} was created for the [[Famicom Disk System]] in 1987 by [[Jaleco]]. The game bears very little resemblance to the original version. For instance, Monty Mole has been replaced with a human on the run from prison and now has to escape through various [[Aztec]]-like temples.
The only real association the game does have with the original is Gremlin's copyright and the familiar "in-game" theme playing on the title screen. Like many Famicom Disk System titles, ''Monty's Great Heart-pounding Escape'' is little known outside Japan as the game was never ported to cartridge for a Western [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] release.
