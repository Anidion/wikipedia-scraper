'''''Cosmo Police Galivan''''' (コスモポリス ギャリバン ''Kosumoporisu Gyariban'') is a single-player, [[shoot-em-up]] [[arcade video game]] developed and released worldwide by [[Nihon Bussan|Nichibutsu]]. The game is a homage to the Japanese [[tokusatsu]] shows ''[[Space Sheriff Gavan]]'' and ''[[Space Sheriff Sharivan]]''. It was later ported to [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is included in the [[Arcade Archives]] series for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo Switch]]. The game has a sequel on [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], called ''Cosmo Police Galivan II: Arrow of Justice''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/cosmo-police-galivan-ii-arrow-of-justice|title=Cosmo Police Galivan II: Arrow of Justice for SNES (1993) - MobyGames|website=MobyGames|access-date=2018-07-21}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==

In the game, the player takes the role of the last remaining member of the Cosmo Police, who runs and jumps around a multi-directional scrolling environment on planet Cynep, with caves, baroque rooms and underwater zones, destroying or avoiding waves of constantly attacking robots, aliens and alien ships.

The player starts the game as an unarmed human, whose only attacking options are kicking and punching, but picking up a POW item encases the human in a robotic suit and arms the player with a laser gun. Collecting the blue POW items while in the suit awards the player with a powerful beam weapon for a limited time, while the red POW item gives the player a three-shot cannon. POW items are dotted throughout the levels and can also be gained by shooting the blue robot aliens.

The player's character has an energy bar that decreases whenever the player is hit. Should this fall below the halfway point, the robot suit will be lost and the player will once again be an unarmed human. Collecting a POW item while in human form will restore the player's energy. If a POW is collected while wearing the suit, however, the player's energy will NOT be increased but their weapon will receive a power-up. The game's platforms are littered with springboards that fire the player high into the air when stepped on. Some platforms - often containing POW items - can only be reached via a springboard.

At the end of every level, the player has to defeat a boss. The game only features two levels which, when completed, repeat endlessly.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Galivan'' on their January 15, 1986 issue as being the tenth most-successful table arcade unit at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=276|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 January 1986|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>
