'''''Take the A-Train III''''' (known internationally as '''''A-Train''''') is the third game in the A-Train series. It was originally developed and published by Japanese [[Video game developer|game developer]] [[Artdink]] for Japan, and was later published by [[Maxis]] for the United States. It was originally released in December 1990 for the NEC PC-9801, [[FM Towns Marty]], [[Sharp X68000]], and [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] (TurboGrafx-16).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Neo_Kobe_Fujitsu_FM_Towns_2016-02-25|title=FM Towns ROM Archive}} A-Train FM Towns ROM.</ref> The US version was released in October 1992 on DOS and Amiga.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hol.abime.net/3339|title = A-Train : Hall of Light - the database of Amiga games}}</ref> Later, the Japanese version was re-released in March 2000 for [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows 98|98]]. Artdink ported the A-Train III along with the editor to Windows 95, and published both titles as a package as the 3rd ARTDINK BEST CHOICE title in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The game puts players in command of a railway company. There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the city and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended. A-Train III is the first game in the series to make use of [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|near-isometric]] [[Axonometric projection#Three types of axonometric projections|dimetric projection]] to present the city, similar to Maxis's later ''[[SimCity 2000]]''.<ref name="pcmuseum">[http://www.pcmuseum.ca/details.asp?id=40218&type=software A-Train] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222203632/http://www.pcmuseum.ca/details.asp?id=40218&type=software |date=2017-02-22 }}, Personal Computer Museum</ref> There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself.  As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the conditions are right, and if these areas are populated enough.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''''A.III. Map Construction''''', known internationally as '''''A-Train Construction Set''''', is an editor that can change existing saved games, or to build landscapes from scratch. It comes with 6 sample maps.  Maxis also published A-Train Construction Set with A-Train as a single package in Europe, without the Ocean Software label.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==''MD A-Train''==
{{nihongo|A Ressha de Ikou MD|Ａ列車で行こうＭＤ||"MD A-Train"}} is a simulation game involving the construction of a railroad in order to boost the city's mass transit system.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The game was released to an exclusively Japanese market; with no release ever being attempted for the North American or European markets.

The player must use the resources at hand to build a railroad connecting the two ends of a map in each scenario. A train can be controlled throughout the day (05:00–17:00) while building new tracks and stations. Nighttime activities (17:00–05:00) involve changing train schedules to better suit the needs of the player's growing mass transportation hub. New developments will spring up around the tracks and stations. This permits the player to increase the amount of money that can earn; resulting in the increased ability to build railroad tracks and stations for the growing city. Five scenarios offer a tutorial mode for first-time players, an extremely hard scenario for veterans, and three more scenarios for players in between the two extremes in difficulty levels. Players can play using speeds that range from slow to normal to fast.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
