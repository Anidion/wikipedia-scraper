'''''Desert Fox''''' is a 1985 video game developed by [[Sydney Development Corporation]] and published by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] and [[U.S. Gold]] (in Europe){{r|avantage1986}}{{r|brooks199309}}. It was subsequently re-released by Avantage and PowerHouse.

==Reception==
1991 and 1993 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' surveys of strategy and war games gave it one star out of five, stating that "it attempted to mix both arcade play and simulation, and ultimately failed on both levels".{{r|brooks199111}}{{r|brooks199309}}

In contrast, ''[[Zzap!64]]'' thought the game was "an excellent blend of strategy and arcade action" and gave it an overall rating of 87%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=010&page=085&magazine=zzap|title = Redirecting}}</ref>
