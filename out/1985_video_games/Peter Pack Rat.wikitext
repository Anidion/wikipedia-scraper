==Gameplay==
''Peter Pack Rat'' is a [[platform game]] where the player controls Peter, a [[pack rat]], who must gather objects such as bottles, cans, or wrenches and take them back to the starting point to complete each level. The game features three unique stages that repeat in a fixed cycle - a junkyard, a sewer, and a large tree - with the layout, number of enemies, and number of required objects changing each time. A group of enemies known as "The Gang" serve as the main obstacles, and include Riff Rat and the Rats of Flatbush, Clawd the [[cat]], Scrapper the [[bulldog]], Sticky the [[spider]], Slugger the [[bat]], Big Al the [[alligator]], Diamond Jim the [[snake]], and Nite [[Owl]]. Peter can pick up and throw additional items to stun enemies, also allowing him the ability to ride some of them about the stage. Points are awarded based on the amount of time remaining when all items are collected and the number of enemies stunned.<ref>{{cite book |title=Peter Pack Rat arcade flyer |url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=780&image=2 |page=2 |publisher=Atari Games |year=1985}}</ref>

The game has four difficulty levels that can be selected before gameplay - Easy, Medium, Hard, and Good Luck - that change the starting level. Jeff Peters holds the official high score with 910,875 points achieved at the Camelot Arcade in [[Anaheim, California]] on March 20, 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/scores.php?scores=3363 |title=Score of Points - Peter Packrat |publisher=Official Twin Galaxies Score Database |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref>

==Development==
''Peter Pack Rat'' was developed by the North American-based [[Atari Games]], and it was designed and programmed by Peter Thompson with graphics and animations by Debbie Hayes (who previously worked as an animator on ''[[Watership Down (film)|Watership Down]]'', ''[[American Pop]]'' and ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]''). Despite there being a 1984 [[copyright]] imprint in the game itself, an official copyright claim was not filed for the title until 1985,<ref name=copyright>{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrightencyclopedia.com/escape-from-the-planet-of-the-robot-monsters-peter-pack-rat/ |title=Escape from the planet of the robot monsters, Peter Pack Rat, Paperboy |publisher=Copyright Encyclopedia |accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> with the game's release being in July of that year.<ref name=history /> It was developed for the [[Atari System|Atari System 1]] upgradable arcade hardware,<ref name=history /> and it uses the same audio and coding processing [[subroutine]]s as ''[[Marble Madness]]'', also released for the platform.<ref name=copyright /> The game was field tested at Merlin's Castle arcade in [[San Jose, California]] for bug-checking and refinements before its widespread release.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513030818/http://www.wilwheaton.net/2006/01/peter_packrat.php|archivedate=May 13, 2008|url=http://www.wilwheaton.net/2006/01/peter_packrat.php |title=peter packrat |publisher=Wil Wheaton dot Net |author=Wheaton, Wil |author-link=Wil Wheaton |date=January 25, 2006 |accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

Brad Fuller composed the music for the original arcade version, which used a main [[MOS Technology 6502|6502A]] sound processor and secondary [[Yamaha YM2151|YM2151]] processor for FM stereo.<ref name=spec>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8998 |title=Peter Pack Rat - Videogame by Atari Games |publisher=Killer List of Video Games |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref> Music from the arcade release was included on the ''That's Atari Music -G.S.M.
