{{nihongo foot|'''''Baraduke''''',|バラデューク|Baradyūku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} renamed '''''Alien Sector''''' in some regions, is a [[run and gun video game]] released for arcades by [[Namco]] in 1985. A home version was published for the [[X68000]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Baraduke.png|left|thumb|Arcade screenshot]]

The player takes control of a spacewoman in a biohazard suit. Player 1 is Kissy and Player 2 is Takky. They must clear eight worlds of increasing difficulty (each one is composed of five regular floors and one boss floor) by using their wave guns to destroy all the enemies populating them. They must also save the one-eyed Paccets for extra points and the chance to earn another shield in the end-of-floor bonus games.

On each floor there are a certain number of enemies known as Octy, which will leave power-up capsules behind when defeated. Defeating all the Octy on the current floor will open up a pipe at the bottom of the floor, and the player will have to find and enter it in order to proceed to the next one. The boss floors feature a giant enemy (a Blue Worm in Worlds 1, 3, 5 and 7, a Turning Eye in Worlds 2, 4 and 6, and the Octy King himself in World 8) who must be killed in order to proceed to the next world.

==Release==
''Baraduke'' runs on [[Namco Pac-Land]] hardware, but with a video system like that used in ''[[Metro-Cross]]'' and ''[[Dragon Buster]]'' (modified to support vertical scrolling and a 2048-color palette). In 1995, ten years after its original arcade release, it was ported to the [[X68000]], and was also included in the fifth volume of the ''[[Namco Museum]]'' series on the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. It also appeared in ''[[Namco Museum Virtual Arcade]]'' on the [[Xbox 360]], and most recently, as one of the games available in ''Pac-Man's Pixel Bash''.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Baraduke'' on their September 1, 1985 issue as being the fifteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=267|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 September 1985|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>

Clare Edgeley of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reviewed the arcade game in October 1985. She said there's "not much in the way of graphics" or "a story line" but "there's plenty of blasting material." She called it a "reasonably fast, mildly addictive" game, but said it "hasn't got the qualities to take it into the top ten arcade games."<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |last=Edgeley |first=Clare |title=Arcade Action |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1985 |issue=49 (November 1985) |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=80–1 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/220/598}}</ref>

In a 2016 retrospective, Federico Tiraboschi of ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' compared the game to [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' (1986), noting that ''Baraduke'' anticipated several elements of ''Metroid''. He said that "in both you play as a faceless space soldier in a bright-colored suit who travels inside a sprawling complex of caves full of weird alien creatures" and both later reveal the [[player character]] to be female. However, he said ''Baraduke'' "focuses more on the shooting than the exploration, which is there but to a minimal extent" compared to ''Metroid''. He also compared ''Baraduke'' to [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Section Z]]'' (1985), released later the same year, noting that in "both games the players control a free-range spaceman with a jetpack traversing a number of sectors scrolling both horizontally and vertically," but that "in ''Baraduke'' the player characters are affected by gravity and their gun's recoil."<ref name="HG101">{{Cite web|last=Tiraboschi|first=Federico|url=https://hg101.kontek.net/baraduke/baraduke.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Baraduke|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=April 19, 2016|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>

==Legacy==
A sequel titled ''[[Bakutotsu Kijūtei]]'' was released in 1988, but only in Japan. It was the second game from the company to allow scores not ending in "0" (the first was ''[[Hopping Mappy]]'', which was released in 1986).

''Baraduke'' is noted as an early example of a female game protagonist, with her gender being revealed in a "twist" ending.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Draycott |first=Jane |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36ZxEAAAQBAJ |title=Women in Classical Video Games |last2=Cook |first2=Kate |date=2022-08-11 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-350-24193-0 |pages=25 |language=en}}</ref> Although the game's primary protagonist, Toby "Kissy" Masuyo, is a woman, the player is led to believe she is a man until her face is revealed in the ending. This predated by one year [[Samus Aran]] from ''[[Metroid]]'' as a human female playable character.<ref name="HG101"/> The game has been further compared to ''Metroid'' for its similarities, as both games feature a maze filled with alien enemies, and a "surprise" reveal of their female protagonists at the end.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-12 |title=Mr. Driller's mom hits the Arcade Archives in Namco classic Baraduke |url=https://www.destructoid.com/baraduke-arcade-archives-namco-retro-ps4-switch/ |access-date=2023-01-09 |website=Destructoid |language=en-US}}</ref>

In the ''[[Mr. Driller]]'' series of games, Kissy Masuyo is a supporting character under the name Toby Masuyo (they refer to "Kissy" as being her nickname). She has married and divorced [[Taizo Hori]] (better known as ''[[Dig Dug]]'', the protagonist of the 1982 arcade game of the same name) and they have three children, [[Susumu Hori]] (who is the main character of ''Mr. Driller''), Ataru Hori, and Taiyo Toby. Kissy is also a playable character in the Japan-only tactical role-playing video game ''[[Namco x Capcom]]'', where she is teamed up with Hiromi Tengenji from ''[[Burning Force]]''. Because of her divorce, she seems to have a grudge against [[Taizo Hori]], who also appears in this game (a reference to the ''Mr. Driller'' series). [[Tron Bonne]], from [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Mega Man Legends]]'' game, mistakes her for a boy.

A Paccet (which is a small, round yellow alien with only one eye) appears in the background as a painting in ''[[Tales of Destiny]]''. [[Elle Mel Marta]]'s backpack in ''[[Tales of Xillia 2]]'' is also a Paccet, with a small charm shaped like Kissy attached to it. Paccet makes a cameo in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' as part of [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man's]] taunt, "Namco Roulette".
