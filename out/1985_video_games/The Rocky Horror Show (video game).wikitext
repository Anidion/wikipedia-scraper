==Development==
''The Rocky Horror Show'' was published and developed by [[CRL Group]], having made previously licensed games such as [[The War of the Worlds (1984 video game)|''The War of the Worlds'']]. In 1984, negotiations by CRL were made to obtain the rights to make a computer game on the property.<ref name="PCW">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Popular Computing Weekly]]|title=Rocky Horror Picture Show game from CRL|date=8 November 1984|page=5|url=https://archive.org/stream/popular-computing-weekly-1984-11-08/PopularComputing_Weekly_Issue_1984-11-08#page/n3/mode/2up}}</ref> CRL's [[CEO]] Clem Chambers claimed in an interview with ''[[GamesTM]]'' that the rights holder for the property approached the company after being impressed by their work with ''The War of the Worlds''.<ref>{{cite interview|url=https://www.gamestm.co.uk/interviews/in-converation-with-clem-chambers/|title=In converation with Clem Chambers|author=GamesTM Staff|work=[[GamesTM]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}</ref> Chambers stated he wanted to base the game on the environments of the stage show instead of "the elements of dubious taste in the show itself".<ref name="PCW"/>

''Rocky Horror''{{'}}s creator [[Richard O'Brien]] did not have much involvement with making the game, due to being "terrified of technology". Ian Ellery, a fan of ''Rocky Horror'', was the game's programmer.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]|title=Rocky Horror - A Small Scream|page=23|volume=5|number=3|date=March 1985|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-computer-magazine-1985-03/YourComputer_1985_03#page/n21/mode/2up/search/rocky}}</ref>

''The Rocky Horror Show'' received generally positive reviews.

Roy Wagner reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The game is a challenge, but is it worth it? I think not."<ref name="CGW34">{{cite magazine |last=Wagner |first=Roy |title=Commodore Key |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January–February 1987 |volume=1 |issue=34 |pages=39}}</ref>

Zzap!64 thought the Commodore 64 version was inferior to the Spectrum version and did not have much lasting appeal. They rated it 43% overall.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-004/page/n71/mode/2up?view=theater | title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 004 | date=August 1985 }}</ref>

Retrospectives of the game have also been positive. [[Retro Gamer]] considered the game to be decent and worth playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-rocky-horror-show/|title=The Rocky Horror Show|author=Retro Gamer Staff|work=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=28 November 2008|accessdate=1 August 2017}}</ref> Sam Derboo from Hardcore Gaming 101 criticized the Commodore 64 version for running slow compared to the Spectrum and Amstrad versions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/kusoge/kusoge-rockyhorrorshow.htm|title=Your Weekly Kusoge: The Rocky Horror Show|last=Derboo|first=Sam|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=11 June 2012|accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref>

==Proposed Sequel==
CRL had also originally intended to release a text adventure game called "The Rocky Horror Adventure Game" the following year, and was even teased at the ending of the Rocky Horror Show game.  However the actual game never got beyond the early development stages and therefore was never released.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/the-rocky-horror-adventure-show/ | title=The Rocky Horror Adventure Show | date=July 2014 }}</ref>

==Remake==
The game was remade in 1999 as ''[[Rocky Interactive Horror Show]]'' by On-Line Entertainment for [[Microsoft Windows]].  The game was re-developed as a point and click adventure but the aim of the game remained the same as before with the player selecting either Brad or Janet as they try to escape from Dr. Frank-N-Furter's castle.  The game was also notable for cut-screens featuring [[Richard O'Brien]] and [[Christopher Lee]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/22030/rocky-interactive-horror-show/ | title=Rocky Interactive Horror Show | date=Feb 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timewarp.org.uk/games/gamesrm6.htm#pics/ | title=Rocky Interactive Horror Show | date=Sep 2008 }}</ref>
