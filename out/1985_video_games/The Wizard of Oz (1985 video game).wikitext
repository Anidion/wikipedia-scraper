==Reception==
''The Wizard of Oz'' was positively received by the press. 

''II Computing'' said that "a good parser makes it easy to have believable dialogues" with the characters, and observed, "The on-screen illustrations are not flashy. They utilize the Apple's graphics well, but in a way that appears more like a children's storybook than an epic cartoon novel. This, of course, is the way you would want such a story to be told."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/II_Computing_Vol_1_No_3_Feb_Mar_86#page/n37/mode/1up/ |title=II Computing Vol 1 No 3 Feb Mar 86 |date= |accessdate=2015-11-03}}</ref>

''[[Ahoy!]]'' described the game as "a good introduction to adventuring for any novice gamer," saying that "there's little danger of getting in a jam that defies the player's skill." Still, "advanced adventurers won't find enough here to challenge their abilities."<ref name=Ahoy/>

''[[Commodore Power Play]]'' complimented the game's parser, saying that "it has a larger vocabulary and understands prepositions and other parts of speech not recognized by some other games... You can 'talk about' a topic to a character, 'tell' them about something, 'ask' questions, and even inquire 'now what?' for a clue."<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/commodore-power-play-18/Commodore_Power-Play_1985_Issue_18_V4_N06_Dec_Jan#page/n11/mode/1up/ |title=Commodore Power Play Issue 18 |date= December 1985|accessdate=2015-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/commodore-power-play-20/Commodore_Power-Play_1986_Issue_20_V5_N02_Apr_May#page/n127/mode/1up/ |title=Commodore Power Play Issue 20 |date= April 1986|accessdate=2015-11-03}}</ref>
