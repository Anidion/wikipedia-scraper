==Gameplay==
''Rocketball'' is set in the year 2010 AD, where worldwide disputes are no longer settled through wars, but through a circular Rocket Ball arena.

The game is similar to [[Roller Derby]] in that two teams on roller skates travel counter-clockwise around a banked, circular track. The object of the game is to score points by throwing a softball-sized metal ball into a cone-shaped goal target inset into the wall of the arena. Balls are fired into play, in the same direction players skate, by cannons when play begins and to restart play after the ball rolls out of play or a goal is scored. Players can use fists, elbows and knees to disable their opponents.

Each Rocketball team has five active players on roller skates. Unlike the film, there are no players riding [[motorcycles]]. The four Rocketball teams are [[Houston]] (wearing blue), [[Tokyo]] (yellow), [[Moscow]] (burgundy) and [[Madrid]] (Green), which correspond to futuristic city states.<ref>[http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/reviews/view.php%3Fid%3D279 Rocket Ball]</ref> (The teams Houston, Tokyo and Madrid also featured in the ''Rollerball'' film.)

Games have a duration of ten minutes. 

==Packaging==
''Rocketball'' came in a Single Cassette Case.<ref>[http://c64tapes.org/title.php?id=1049 C64 games – game<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It boasted super-smooth scrolling, being written in 100% [[machine code]], and a shadow on the ball.<ref>[http://s64.emuunlim.com/gameinfos/rocketball/rocketball.htm STADIUM 64 – Game Infos: Rocket Ball<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
