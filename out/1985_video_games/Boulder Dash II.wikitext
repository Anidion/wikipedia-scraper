==Reception==
Paul Rixon for ''[[Page 6]]'' said that "the majority of Atarians will already have the ''Boulderdash'' duo in their collections, but if it's missing from yours then you ought to make amends as soon as possible".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Page_6_Issue_30_1987-11_ABACUS_GB/page/n81/mode/2up|title=Page 6 - Issue 30 (1987-11)(ABACUS)(GB)|date=November 22, 1987|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> J. Mark Hunter for ''The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review'' said: "It's good. That's undeniable. It is one of my personal favourites due to its teasing action and glittering end results. The diamonds we all wish could be our best fried".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Australian_Commodore_and_Amiga_Review_The_Volume_4_Issue_11_1987-11_Saturday_Magazine_AU/page/n49/mode/2up|title=Australian Commodore and Amiga Review, The - Volume 4 Issue 11 (1987-11)(Saturday Magazine)(AU)|date=November 22, 1987|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> ''[[Zzap!64|Zzap!]]'' said that "despite the extra complexities, it doesn't seem any harder overall – indeed, experienced ''Boulder Dash'' players may be able to plough straight through level one at virtually the first attempt. The higher levels are another matter".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/zzapp_64_issue_003_600dpi/page/n27/mode/2up|title=Zzap! 64 Issue 003 (HQ)|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' said: "I expected ''Rockford's Riot'' to be a step forward from ''Boulder Dash'', but it's really just a step sideways. Admittedly, there a few new features, but for all intents and purposes ''Rockfords Riot'' is a souped-up ''Boulder Dash''".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Crash_Magazine_021/page/24/mode/2up|title=Crash Magazine 021|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Clare Edgeley for ''[[Sinclair User]]'' said that "''Rockford's Riot'' is packaged – in a ludicrous vertical box crowned by a luminous disc – with ''Boulder Dash'', so you can see exactly how similar both games are".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Sinclair_User_044/page/26/mode/2up|title=Sinclair User 044|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Craig Grannell for the 2012 ''Sinclair ZX Spectrum And Commodore 64 Book'' wrote that "''Rockford's Revenge'' provided gamer with a new set of Liepa-designed caves, but little else".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Sinclair_ZX_Spectrum_and_Commodore_64_Book-2012/page/n207/mode/2up|title=Sinclair ZX Spectrum And Commodore 64 Book 2012|date=February 22, 2012|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
