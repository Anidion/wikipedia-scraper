'''''Infernal Runner''''' is a horror-themed [[platform game]] for the [[Commodore 64]] published by [[Loriciel]] in 1985 and later adapted to the [[Amstrad CPC]]. Game designer [[Éric Chahi]], who later created ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]],'' is credited on the Amstrad version. ''Infernal Runner'' a [[flip screen]] game similar in style to ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'': a series of platform-filled screens that can be moved between, each with specific obstacles to avoid.

==Gameplay==
Players find themselves trapped in a house with lethal traps and various other menaces, and they must escape alive by collecting all keys and opening all trunks, all while avoiding starvation by collecting food. It is unknown what the actual story is: after collecting enough items, a wall on the map will disappear and the player can escape the game, upon which the character is run over by an ambulance car and is carried offscreen on a stretcher.

==Development==
The C64 version is credited to Yves Korta and Michel Koell. The Amstrad version was created by [[Éric Chahi]] with music by Michel Winogradof.
