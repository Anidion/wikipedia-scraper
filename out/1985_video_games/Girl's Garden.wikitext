== Development ==
''Girl's Garden'' was the first game developed for Sega by programmers [[Yuji Naka]] and [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (composer)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://sega.jp/fb/album/01_gg/|title=名作アルバム - 『ガールズガーデン』|date=15 January 2002|website=Sega|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323021601/http://sega.jp/fb/album/01_gg/|archive-date=23 March 2016|url-status=live|access-date=26 January 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/11/my-life-in-games|title=Five Titans of Japanese Video Game Music on Their Influences and Key Creations|last=Dwyer|first=Nick|date=10 November 2016|website=Red Bull Music Academy Daily|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713170928/http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/11/my-life-in-games|archive-date=13 July 2018|url-status=live|access-date=26 January 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  After Naka joined Sega in April 1984, he was asked by his supervisor to try developing games for girls as part of his initial month of training.<ref name=":0" /> Naka collaborated with Kawaguchi, another new programmer to Sega,<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/v/hara/ga_core/ga_core1_2.html|title=Hiro師匠&光吉猛修インタビュー1/4回 Page2（GA-COREより）|date=1 April 2009|website=Game Music Core|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417194415/http://www.ne.jp/asahi/v/hara/ga_core/ga_core1_2.html|archive-date=17 April 2015|url-status=live|access-date=26 January 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and showed their progress on ''Girl's Garden'' to their supervisor after about two months.<ref name=":0" /> Their boss decided it was good enough to be worked into a full game and sold for the [[SG-1000]].<ref name=":0" />

Development on ''Girl's Garden'' lasted five months.<ref name=":0" /> Hardware limitations made scrolling the screen and displaying many sprites difficult. As the system could only render four sprites per scanline, Naka and Kawaguchi instead drew the enemy bears to the background. It was difficult to scroll the background layer while also moving the bears around the screen and animating the blooming flowers.<ref name=":0" /> The music and sounds were programmed by Tohru Nakabayashi and Katsuhiro Hayashi.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" />

It took three months to manufacture the [[Read-only memory|ROM chips]]. Sega produced around 80,000 copies of ''Girl's Garden'', half of which were sold.<ref name=":0" /> According to contemporary game publication ''Game Machine'', the game was released in January 1985.<ref name="Game Machine Magazine">{{cite web|title=Home Video Game Console(Japanese, top-right)|url=https://archive.org/details/game-machine-magazine-19850715p|work=Game Machine Magazine 15th July '85| date=15 July 1985 |publisher=Amusement Press Inc., Osaka, Japan|accessdate=25 August 2023}}</ref> In 1998, ''Sega Saturn Magazine'' (Japan) wrote that it was released in December 1984.<ref name=":3">{{Cite magazine|date=13 March 1998|title=中 裕司|magazine=Sega Saturn Magazine|language=ja|volume=7|pages=128}}</ref> In a 2002 interview, Naka argued that the game's development and manufacturing time meant it could not have possibly been released in 1984.
