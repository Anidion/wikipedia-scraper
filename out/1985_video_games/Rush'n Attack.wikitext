'''''Rush'n Attack''''', also known as {{nihongo foot|'''''Green Beret'''''|グリーンベレー|Gurīn Berē|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan and Europe, is a [[Run and gun video game|run-and-gun]] and [[Hack and slash|hack-and-slash]] video game developed and released by [[Konami]] for arcades in 1985, and later converted to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[home computer]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9382| title=Rush'n Attack| publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=5 Oct 2013}}</ref> Its North American title is a play on the phrase "Russian attack"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/11/don_your_green_beret_konamis_rushn_attack_hits_the_switch_today|title=Don Your Green Beret, Konami's Rush'n Attack Hits The Switch Today|first=Damien|last=McFerran|work=nintendolife|date=Nov 27, 2020|accessdate=Sep 30, 2021}}</ref> due to its [[Cold War]] setting. It was ported to home systems and became a critical and commercial success for arcades and home computers.

==Gameplay==
The players assume the roles of the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States special operations]] Green Berets (named Steve and Ben on the Japanese [[Famicom]] ad poster) who are infiltrating an enemy military base to save POWs from execution by firing squad. There are four stages, each ending with a special group of ambushers:
#Marshalling Area, ends with a truckload of jump-kicking enemies
#Harbor, ends with a pack of German Shepherds
#Air Base, ends  with three [[autogyro]]s
#Siberian Camp, ends with three flame thrower operators
The [[Soviet Armed Forces]] that attack throughout every stage are Soldiers, Gunners, Supply Runners, Combat Specialists, Jetpack Soldiers, [[German Shepherd]]s, Parachute Gunners, Gyrocopters, and Flame Throwers.

The omnipresent [[combat knife]] can be supplemented with captured arms. By eliminating certain Russian militants, the players can obtain a three-shot [[flamethrower]], a four-shot [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]], or a three-pack of [[hand grenade]]s. When the mission is accomplished, the four rescued POWs salute and the player repeats the game from the first stage on the next difficulty level. An invisible time limit kills the player.

Extra lives are given at 30,000 and 70,000, and per 70,000 up to 980,000, and [[survival of the fittest]] mode thereafter.{{clarify|date=March 2023}}

The Commodore 64 port was programmed by David Collier, with graphics by Steve Wahid and music by [[Martin Galway]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Green Beret |url=https://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1096 |website=Lemon64 |access-date=1 May 2021}}</ref><ref name="CU30" /> The Spectrum version was programmed by [[Jonathan Smith (games programmer)|Jonathan Smith]].<ref name='crashgreenberet'>{{cite magazine |title=Green Beret|magazine=Crash|issue=28|publisher=Newsfield|date=May 1986|page=118|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=995&page=118|access-date=11 November 2022}}</ref>

It was released in North America in December 1986<ref>{{cite news |title=Availability Update |work=[[Computer Entertainer]] |date=February 1987 |page=14 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/newsletters/video_game_update/computer_entertainer_feb87.pdf#page=14}}</ref> and an unrelated [[IBM PC]] version was released by Konami for the North American market with the ''Rush'n Attack'' name in 1989.

===Famicom Disk System and NES===
A [[Family Computer Disk System]] version of ''Green Beret'' was released in Japan on April 10, [[1987 in video gaming|1987]], along with a corresponding version for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (as ''Rush'n Attack'') released that month in [[North America]], and on June 8, 1989 in [[Europe]].

The objective in the NES version was changed from rescuing prisoners to destroying a secret weapon being developed in the enemy's headquarters. A two-player simultaneous cooperative mode was introduced. The gameplay mechanics are essentially identical to the arcade version; however, the Flamethrower is removed (only the Rocket Launcher and Grenades remain) and two new power-up items are introduced: a Star mark which grants invincibility and a pistol with unlimited ammo, both which are only usable for a limited period. The NES version features two additional stages that are not in the arcade game: an airport set between the Missile Base and the Harbor, where the player faces a group of rocket soldiers at the end; and a new final stage set inside the enemy's base that ends with the player using rocket launchers dropped by enemy soldiers to disarm a nuclear missile. The flamethrower corps at the end of the Warehouse stage was replaced by a paratrooper unit. The Famicom version has a few cosmetic differences with higher difficulty compared to its NES counterpart, along with underground areas in three of the levels, which are accessed via destroying specific mines that reveal ladders to the floors below.

===Game Boy Advance===
A conversion of the arcade version of ''Rush'n Attack'' is included in the [[2002 in video gaming|2002]] compilation ''[[Konami Collector's Series: Arcade Advanced]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. The game features the same four stages as in the arcade version, and two extra stages unlocked via the [[Konami Code]]. A two-player versus mode has been added, which utilizes the [[Game Link Cable]]. The A button jumps instead of the D-pad.

===Nintendo DS===
A second portable version is included in the [[2007 in video gaming|2007]] compilation ''[[Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]]. Unlike the GBA version, the DS version is a direct port of the original arcade game, but includes various bonus features such as scans of the instruction cards and leaflet, as well as tips.

===Xbox 360===
''Rush'n Attack'' was released on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the [[Xbox 360]] on May 23, [[2007 in video gaming|2007]]. This version is another direct port of the arcade game, but features an optional game mode with improved graphics and a remixed soundtrack. It was developed by [[Digital Eclipse]].

===Konami Net DX===
''Green Beret'' was released for smartphones in Japan in [[2006 in video gaming|2006]]. The mobile version is a direct port of the Famicom version with a new health bar. The mobile port was re-released in China for Java phones on December 26, [[2008 in video gaming|2008]].

''Green Beret'' was well-received by critics. Mike Roberts and Eric Doyle of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' magazine gave the arcade game a positive review, comparing it favorably with the [[action film]] ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985) while calling it an "incredibly violent game" that is "brilliant to play".<ref name="CG8">{{cite magazine |last1=Roberts |first1=Mike |last2=Doyle |first2=Eric |title=Coin-Op Connection |magazine=[[Computer Gamer]] |date=November 1985 |issue=8 |pages=26–7 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_08_1985-11_Argus_Press_GB/page/n25/mode/2up}}</ref> ''[[Commodore User]]'' said the arcade version is "a kind of [[Side-scrolling|rightwards scrolling]] ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'' [but] much better" while praising "brilliant" graphics and sound.<ref name="CU30"/>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reviewed the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions, calling the game "Konami's answer" to [[Capcom]]'s ''Commando'' (1985) and comparing it favorably with the ''Rambo'' film series. The review said it is fast, "furious and terribly addictive".<ref name="CVG56"/>
