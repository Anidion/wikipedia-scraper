'''''Dread Dragon Droom''''' (popularly known as Droom) is an [[educational game]] designed and published by HUMMEC ([[Humberside]] Microelectronics in Education Centre) in 1985.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/sim_child-education-plus_1988-08_65_8 |title=Child Education 1988-08: Vol 65 Iss 8 |date=August 1988 |publisher=Scholastic Limited |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/cambridgeprimary0000unse |title=Cambridge primary mathematics.

The game was used widely in [[schools]] throughout the United Kingdom in the 1980s and was one of the first examples of [[United Kingdom|British]] educational software designed specifically for schools.  HUMMEC was the educational support centre of the then [[local education authority|local education authorities]] of Humberside.  Humberside was part of a consortium of LEAs (the others being [[Barnsley]], [[Sheffield]], [[Doncaster]], [[Rotherham]] and, for a time, [[Wakefield]]) which established a regional support centre called RESOURCE, based in Doncaster.

==Plot==
The plot of the game is classic [[fairy-tale]] fantasy: the princess Arminda has been captured by the Dreaded [[Dragon]] Droom, and held in his [[dungeon]], while her suitor Prince Henry has been turned into a [[frog]]. The user has to rescue Arminda, aided by a [[witch]], a [[magicians in fantasy|wizard]], [[fairy|fairies]] and the ever-helpful Little Bit on the way. The game is divided into a number of chapters, each containing a particular puzzle (mathematical, verbal, or logical). Chapters can be practised individually, or the game can be completed from the beginning.

Although the tightly-structured format and educational purpose of the game meant that it was highly linear, the game is notable for its variety of puzzles, colourful [[graphic]]s and playful storyline.

==Development==
This software was written and created by Derek Allen, who was one of the pioneers of ICT in Education. After "Droom" he went on to write various software packages including "Albert's House", "Pond" and "Rainbow Stories", all marketed through RESOURCE. Derek Allen also wrote sequels to the program: "Dragon Droom's Revenge" and "Stardust" (early versions were known simply as "Dust"). Many of his programs continued to be available for PC from Resource Education, which had become a private company based in [[Derbyshire]]. It closed in mid-2015.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151027094743/http://www.resourcekt.co.uk/ Resource Education Website (Internet Archive backup showing closure notice)]</ref>
