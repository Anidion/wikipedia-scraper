'''''Deathstar''''' (also written as '''''DeathStar''''') is [[multidirectional shooter]] for the [[Acorn Electron]] and [[BBC Micro]] developed by Peter Johnson and originally published in the UK by [[Superior Software]] in 1985. It is a clone of the arcade game ''[[Sinistar]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Deathstar in-game screenshot (BBC Micro).png|200px|thumb|left|BBC Micro screenshot]]

The player uses four keys, two to rotate the ship (which is always moving forwards), one for fire and one to launch a starbomb. Firing can destroy both enemy workers and warriors, but only a starbomb can be used against the eponymous Deathstar itself. Collisions with workers, warriors or asteroids (referred to in the instructions as planetoids) do not harm the player.<ref name="inlay-1">{{cite journal|year=1991|title = Acorn Electron cassette inlay (re-release)|journal=DeathStar}}</ref><ref name="8bs-2"/>

The job of the workers is to build the Deathstar by transporting crystals to it, whilst the job of the warriors is to mine the crystals and also defend the Deathstar by attacking the player. The initial objective is to keep on firing at the asteroids until they start to shed crystals, which are then picked up in order to score points, but more importantly the crystals are converted into starbombs. The starbombs are ultimately used against the Deathstar, once the workers have finished constructing it. The player must successfully defeat the Deathstar to progress into the ''Worker Zone'' which has very few planetoids, with a bonus screen between each zone.<ref name="inlay-1"/><ref name="8bs-2"/>

The game employs 16-way scrolling<ref name="8bs-4"/> over a multi-coloured starfield and runs at a fast rate<ref name="8bs-3"/> on both the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron hardware.

Despite the inferior hardware of the Acorn Electron, the in-game sound can be improved up to BBC Micro standards with the addition of Project Expansions' Sound Cartridge.<ref name="acornelectron-5">{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/09/a-elken.html|title=Articles From Issue #09|first=Andy|last=Gilfillan|publisher=Electron User Group (issue 9)|accessdate=2010-10-17|quote=However, if you have Slogger's Turbo Board and Project Expansions' Sound Cartridge, the picture changes dramatically!|archive-date=2011-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717131626/http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/09/a-elken.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The game was instead renamed ''Deathstar'' and a new title screen designed, allowing it to be released as an unofficial clone by [[Superior Software]] in 1985. The game was released shortly after another popular game ''[[Repton (video game)|Repton]]'' and is regarded as being part of a successful run of titles from Superior Software in a short space of time.<ref name="acornelectron-3">{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/eu/arts/a-head.html|title=Heading For The Century|first=Tony|last=Leah|publisher=[[Electron User]] (issue 7.02)|accessdate=2010-10-17|quote=In the summer of the same year came ''REPTON'', another tremendous success, swiftly followed by ''DEATHSTAR''.|archive-date=2011-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717131526/http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/eu/arts/a-head.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The then-renamed ''Deathstar'' was first published solely by Superior Software in 1985 and later re-released in 1989 by Superior Software and [[Blue Ribbon (software house)|Blue Ribbon]] as a budget title.

A similar title ''[[Mega Apocalypse]]'', also for the BBC Micro, was due to be released by ''Martech Games Ltd'', but was ultimately abandoned half-finished in 1988.<ref name="beebgames-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.beebgames.com/lostgames.php|title=Lost Games|first=C|last=Boylan|year=2009|publisher=www.beebgames.com|accessdate=2010-10-17|quote=Half-finished copies, according to Jeremy Grayson, did leak out, and is supposedly a bit like the Superior Software game ''Deathstar''.}}</ref>

===Speech chip support===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}
The ''Sinistar'' arcade game uses sampled speech, which is beyond the abilities of standard BBC Micro and Electron hardware. The BBC Micro has a speech synthesiser chip available as an official add-on, but it has a limited vocabulary. Users who played with this hardware would hear the speech chip say "R, R, R, I an complete" (using the letter "R" repeated for the laugh, and "an" instead of "am"), though this is not a line from the arcade original. Programmer Peter Johnson said at the time: "I knew very few gamers would have that speech chip fitted, but I would have loved to see the expression of surprise on their faces the first time they heard the ''DeathStar'' speak".

==Reception==
Roland Waddliove, writing in ''[[Electron User]]'' magazine stated that "DEATHSTAR is a super fast, all-action arcade classic", "it's the sort of game that you can't put down" and "you've got to have just one more go".<ref name="8bs-3"/> Martin Reed also in Electron User described the game as "an excellent conversion" and "a great blast".<ref name="8bs-4"/>

The Electron User Group describe the game as "furiously fast", "supremely playable" and as having "a large playing window",<ref name="acornelectron-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/revs/beau_jolly/r-5st1.html|title=Product: FIVE STAR GAMES|last=E|first=Dave|publisher=Electron User Group (issue 67)|accessdate=2010-10-17|quote=''DEATHSTAR'' is a furiously fast number, with a radar screen at the top of the screen and a large playing window situated beneath|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717131646/http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/revs/beau_jolly/r-5st1.html|archive-date=2011-07-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> whilst the Monkey's Brain website describes the game as "another top-quality arcade conversion".<ref name="themonkeysbrain-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.themonkeysbrain.karoo.net/Pages/ElecGames.htm|title=Electron Games|first=Rob|last=Dewick|publisher=The Monkey's Brain|accessdate=2010-10-17|quote=Shoot the asteroids to gather bombs to fire at the deathstar when it is built.}}</ref> Oliver Robinson on the bbcmicrogames.com website describes the game as "almost arcade perfect" and as "an example of how well the BBC could replicate fast paced, action arcade games".<ref name="bbcmicrogames-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcmicrogames.com/superior.html|title=Only the Best BBC Micro Games - Superior Games|first=Oliver|last=Robinson|publisher=www.bbcmicrogames.com|accessdate=2010-10-17|quote=Almost arcade perfect, this was an example of how well the BBC could replicate fast paced, action arcade games.}}</ref>

Game programmer Jason Sobell stated that he "liked Peter Johnson's ''DeathStar''", pointing out the similarity to the game ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.<ref name="stairwaytohell-3">{{cite web|url=http://www.stairwaytohell.com/authors/jsobell/SG-Sobell.html|title=2007 Interview with Jason Sobell|first=Stuart|last=Goodwin|publisher=www.stairwaytohell.com|year=2007|accessdate=2010-10-17|quote=I also liked Peter Johnson's ''DeathStar'' and ''Space Pilot'', but then I always was an ''Asteroids'' fan.}}</ref>

The game was given a ''BJ score'' of 92% on the ''Five Star Games'' compilation, although this rating was awarded by Beau Jolly themselves, the publisher of the compilation and therefore can not be considered to originate from a neutral source.<ref name="8bs-5"/>

Since the end of the BBC Micro commercial era, some players<ref name="acornelectron-4">{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/62/m-appe.html|title=EUG APPEAL OF ELK ON BEEB Letter From Dave M In EUG #62|first=Dave|last=M|publisher=Electron User Group (Issue 62)|accessdate=2010-10-17|quote=I'm forever playing Electron ''DEATHSTAR'' instead of the official BBC one.}}</ref> using emulation have expressed a preference for playing the Acorn Electron version over the BBC Micro version, because it uses keys 'Z' and 'X' to rotate the spacecraft rather than 'CAPS LOCK' and 'left-CTRL' which are vertically aligned on many modern-day keyboards.
