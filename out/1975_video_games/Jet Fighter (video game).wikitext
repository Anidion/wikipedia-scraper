'''''Jet Fighter''''' is an [[arcade game|arcade]] [[shooter video game]] released in 1975 by [[Atari, Inc.]]<ref name="klov">{{cite web  | title = Jet Fighter Killer List of Video Games Entry  | url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?letter=J&game_id=8232  | accessdate = 2007-07-10 }}</ref> It was distributed in Japan by [[Nakamura Seisakusho]] (Namco).

==Technology==
The game is housed in a custom cabinet that includes two 8-way joysticks (one per player) meant to look like older style flight sticks.  Each stick has a fire button mounted on the top.

==Gameplay==
The players fly in simulated jets around the screen, engaging in a [[dogfight]] and attempting to score hits on their opponent within a limited amount of time. When a player is hit, their plane spins around and an explosion is heard. After a few seconds, the plane recovers, pointing at a random direction.

==Legacy==
* A clone of the game, bearing the same name, was released by Atari subsidiary [[Kee Games]].
* A home console port was included in the [[Atari 2600]] game cartridge [[Combat (video game)|Combat]].
* [[Dogfight (1980 video game)|Dogfight]] by Microlab for Apple II.
