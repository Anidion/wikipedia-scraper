==Gameplay==
Up to six players can play against each other, each choosing a horse while the computer controls the seventh horse on the bottom. Each player's horse begins galloping, and the players must jump over obstacles in their lanes by pressing their colored buttons. The horse that successfully jumps all obstacles smoothly becomes the fastest horse and wins.

==Development==
The game was originally called ''AstroTurf'', and all [[printed circuit boards]] still have the name on the board.<ref name="klov"/> The game is housed in a custom extra wide cabinet that six individually colored and lit buttons used to make a player's horse jump. The monitor is a 23" black and white CRT monitor with 6 color overlays to make each of the 6 horizontally stacked lanes match their colored button counterparts. Sounds include a bugle, galloping hoof beats, and crowd cheers.

==Ports==
A conversion for the [[Atari 2600|Atari Video Computer System]] programmed by Jim Huether was released under the same name in 1980.<ref name=giantlist/> It was developed at Atari and distributed under [[Sears]]' Tele-Games label.<ref name="AtariAge">
