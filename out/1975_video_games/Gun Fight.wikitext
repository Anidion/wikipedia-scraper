Taito's original ''Western Gun'' allows the two players to move around anywhere on the screen. Midway's version, ''Gun Fight'', restricts each player to their respective portions of the screen and also increased the size of the characters.<ref name="honestgamers">{{cite web |title=Gun Fight (Arcade) review |url=http://www.honestgamers.com/13874/arcade/gun-fight/review.html |website=Honest Gamers |date=June 15, 2018 |access-date=17 April 2021}}</ref>

==Development==
Both ''Western Gun'' and ''Gun Fight'' have artwork of Wild West cowboys on the [[video game arcade cabinet|cabinet]], with matching in-game graphics featuring cacti, rocks, and human characters (and a covered wagon in ''Gun Fight''). These [[cartoon]]-like humans were in contrast to earlier games which used miniature shapes to represent abstract blocks or spaceships.<ref name="kohler18"/>

The original game, ''Western Gun'', was created by Tomohiro Nishikado for Taito.<ref name="kohler18"/> The game's concept was adapted from a [[Sega]] arcade [[electro-mechanical game]], also called ''Gun Fight'',<ref name="Smith">{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Alexander |title=They Create Worlds: The Story of the People and Companies That Shaped the Video Game Industry, Vol. I: 1971-1982 |date=19 November 2019 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-0-429-75261-2 |pages=193–95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cxy_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT193}}</ref> which was released in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |title=GUN FIGHT（ガンファイト） |url=https://sega.jp/history/arcade/product/11529/ |website=[[Sega]] |access-date=2 May 2021 |language=ja}}</ref> In that game, two players control cowboy figurines on opposing sides of a playfield full of obstacles, with each player attempting to shoot the opponent's cowboy. The cowboy figurines were adapted into character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], with both players able to maneuver across a landscape while shooting each other. It was the second game by Nishikado to use human character sprites, after a 1974 [[sports video game]] he designed for Taito, ''Basketball'', which was released as ''TV Basketball'' by Midway in North America.<ref name="Smith"/>

Taito licensed ''Western Gun'' to Midway for release in North America, one of the first such licenses, after the 1974 [[scrolling]] [[Racing video game|racing game]] ''[[Tomohiro Nishikado#Speed Race|Speed Race]]'',<ref name="Kohler-211">{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|page=211|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1}}</ref> also designed by Nishikado,<ref>{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|page=16|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1}}</ref> and the 1974 [[sports game]] ''[[List of Taito games|Basketball]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allincolorforaquarter.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/video-game-firsts.html|title = The Golden Age Arcade Historian: Video Game Firsts??|website=Allincolorforaquarter.blogspopt.co.uk|date = 22 November 2013}}</ref> The title ''Western Gun'', while making perfect sense for [[Engrish|Japanese audiences]] in that it conveyed the setting and theme as simply as possible, sounded odd to American audiences, so it was renamed ''Gun Fight'' for its American localization.<ref name="Kohler-211"/>

Taito's version was based on [[Discrete circuit|discrete logic]].<ref name="kohler18"/> When [[Dave Nutting]] adapted the game for Midway, he decided to base it on the [[Intel 8080]], which made ''Gun Fight'' the first video game to use a [[microprocessor]].<ref name="Kent">[[Steve L. Kent]] (2001), ''[[The ultimate history of video games: from Pong to Pokémon and beyond: the story behind the craze that touched our lives and changed the world]]'', p. 64, Prima, {{ISBN|0-7615-3643-4}}</ref> Nutting's company Dave Nutting Associates had already used microprocessor technology in prototypes of arcade [[pinball]] machines, and the first arcade [[pinball]] machine to include a microprocessor, ''[[The Spirit of '76 (pinball)|The Spirit of '76]]'' by [[Mirco Games]], used this technology under license.

[[File:December 1975 advertisement for Gun Fight by Midway.jpg|thumb|A printed ad for the Midway version]]

Midway's version, which had a black-and-white [[Raster graphics|raster]] [[Computer display|monitor]] with a transparent yellow screen overlay, used [[bitmap]]ped [[framebuffer]] technology to display the game text and graphics, including its [[Animation|animated]] human-like characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/Writings/VideogameImpact.pdf#page=24 |page=116|title=The Mass Impact of Video Games|website=Vasulka.org|access-date=26 January 2022}}</ref> To make the animation fast and smooth, the game included a special [[barrel shifter]] circuit built from multiple discrete chips.<ref>The schematic for the "game logic" board of ''Gun Fight'' has a shifter circuit made from four AMD Am25S10 4-bit barrel-shifter chips wired together, along with several [[7400-series integrated circuits|74175]] [[Flip-flop (electronics)|latches]] to hold the data to be shifted and the number of bit positions to shift by.</ref> The microprocessor used this to shift each pattern of picture bits, byte-by-byte, to the proper horizontal bit offset, reading back each shifted byte and then writing it into the framebuffer. The 8080, like other microprocessors of its era, had shift instructions that could only shift by a single bit position. With the shifter circuit, the microprocessor could quickly shift a picture byte by several bit positions, giving it more time for other work. A similar shifter circuit was used in later Midway and Taito games whose hardware was based on ''Gun Fight'', such as ''[[Sea Wolf (video game)|Sea Wolf]]'' and ''[[Space Invaders]]''.<ref name=mw8080bw.cpp>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/mame0219/src/mame/drivers/mw8080bw.cpp |title=mw8080bw.cpp |access-date=2020-03-09 |quote=Most of these games do not actually use the MB14241 shifter IC, but instead implement equivalent functionality using a bunch of standard 74XX IC's.|website=Github.com}}</ref><ref name=8080bw.cpp>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/mame0219/src/mame/drivers/8080bw.cpp |title=mw8080bw.cpp |access-date=2020-03-09 |quote=... data shifter, using either ~11 74xx chips, AM25S10s, Fujitsu MB14221 or Fujitsu MB14241 chips, which all do the same thing.|website=Github.com}}</ref> In some later ''[[Space Invaders]]'' derivatives, such as Taito's ''[[Space Invaders Part II]]'' of 1979, this circuit is a Fujitsu MB14241, a single-chip implementation of the barrel shifter.

Midway's version increased the size of the character sprites, while at the same time restricting each character's movement to their respective portions of the screen.<ref name="honestgamers"/> Nishikado believed that his original version was more fun than Midway's version, but he was impressed with the Midway machine's improved graphics and smoother animation.<ref>{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|page=19|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|quote=As a game, I thought our version of ''Western Gun'' was more fun. But just from using a microprocessor, the walking animation became much smoother and prettier in Midway's version.}}</ref> This led him to design microprocessors into his subsequent games, including the 1978 [[shoot 'em up]] ''[[Space Invaders]]''.<ref name="kohler19">{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|chapter=Chapter 2: An Early History of Cinematic Elements in Video Games|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|page=19|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|access-date=2011-03-27}}</ref>

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Western Gun'' was among the top ten highest-grossing [[1976 in video games|arcade video games of 1976]].<ref name="GM65">{{cite magazine|title=本紙アンケー 〜 ト調査の結果|trans-title=Paper Questionnaire: Results of the Survey |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=65|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 February 1977|page=2|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19770201p.pdf#page=2}}</ref>

In the United States, following its November 1975 release there, ''Gun Fight'' sold 500 [[arcade cabinet]]s by the end of 1975, making it one of the top ten best-selling [[1975 in video games|arcade games of 1975]].<ref name="Baer">{{cite book |last1=Baer |first1=Ralph H. |author1-link=Ralph H.

==Legacy==
The game was included in [[GameSpy]]'s "Hall of Fame" in 2002. They commented that "''Gun Fight'' was the first game to feature two humanized characters attempting to outfight each other, which would become one of the most common themes in games for the next 25-plus years"; that it was one of the first Japanese video games imported to North America; and that Midway's version "was the first microprocessor-based arcade game".<ref name = "gamespy1">{{cite web|last=Cassidy|first=William|title=Gun Fight|url=http://uk.gamespy.com/articles/491/491634p1.html|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|access-date=3 December 2011|date=May 6, 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051114/http://uk.gamespy.com/articles/491/491634p1.html|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>
