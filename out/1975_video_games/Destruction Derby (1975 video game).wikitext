'''''Destruction Derby''''' is an [[Arcade game|arcade]] video game released by [[Exidy]] in 1975<ref name=klov>{{KLOV game|name=Destruction Derby|id=7570}}</ref> as the company's first [[driving game]].<ref name="gah"/> Exidy licensed it to [[Chicago Coin]], who sold the game as '''''Demolition Derby''''' (not to be confused with ''[[Demolition Derby (1984 video game)|Demolition Derby]]'', a 1984 game by Bally Midway). Exidy stopped producing ''Destruction Derby'' to avoid competing with the licensed version, and instead developed a game with similar mechanics: the controversial ''[[Death Race (1976 video game)|Death Race]]''.<ref name="gah"/>

==Reception==
In March 1976, the first annual ''RePlay'' arcade chart listed ''Demolition Derby'' as the ninth-highest-earning [[1975 in video games|arcade video game of the previous year]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Nation's Top Arcade Games |journal=RePlay |date=March 1976}}</ref>
