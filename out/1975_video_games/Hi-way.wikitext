==Gameplay==
This is a game where the player dodges cars on both sides of a narrow two-lane road. For every car successfully passed, one point is awarded. If the player hit a car on the road, the player loses all momentum and does not gain any points. Contrary to previous driving games where the player stood in front of the steering wheel, the player is seated. The game ends when time runs out.

==Technology==
The game hardware is a pre-[[microprocessor]] discrete [[transistor-transistor logic]] (TTL) design, and used the Durastress process. The cabinet was patented Oct. 20, 1975: (U.S. Patent # D243,626).

The game uses [[vertical scrolling]], influenced by [[Taito]]'s ''[[Speed Race]]'' (1974), which was released by [[Midway Manufacturing]] as ''Racer'' in North America. ''Hi-way'' is also the first racing video game to use a sit-down cabinet similar to older [[electro-mechanical game]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Matt |title=Vintage Games 2.0: An Insider Look at the Most Influential Games of All Time |date=8 May 2019 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-000-00092-4 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fU-fDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA73}}</ref> The same cabinet design would be used the next year with Atari's popular driving game ''[[Night Driver (video game)|Night Driver]]'' (1976).<ref name="doteaters">{{cite web | title = Space Wars and Cinematronics | url=https://thedoteaters.com/?bitstory=bitstory-article-2/space-wars-and-cinematronics | accessdate = 2021-03-25 }}</ref>
