==Gameplay==
The player uses a flight stick to steer the plane up, down, right, and left to get the enemy in his or her sights. The top-mounted fire button is then used to shoot the enemy plane and gain points.

==Release==
The game is housed in a custom wide cabinet modeled to look like a [[World War I]] [[biplane]] [[cockpit]]. It includes a similarly modeled flight stick with top-mounted fire button. The game's [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] is composed of discrete technology and includes Atari/Kee's Durastress technology.<ref name="armchairarcade" /> One overlay provides the onscreen crosshair.<ref name="klov">{{KLOV game|id=9160|name=Pursuit}}</ref>
