'''''Doctor Pong''''', also known as '''''Puppy Pong''''', is an adaption of the original arcade [[Pong]] for use in a non-coin-operated environment. It was conceptualized by [[Nolan Bushnell]], Steve Bristow, and a [[marketing]] firm to move their [[arcade video game]]s into a non-arcade environmentâ€”in this case, to help occupy children in [[Pediatrics|pediatricians']] [[waiting room]]s. Originally designed to be a model of [[Snoopy|Snoopy's]] [[doghouse]] with Pong built into the side of it, when [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]] declined Atari the use of Snoopy, the model was changed to a generic doghouse with a puppy looking over the top. ''Puppy Pong'' saw a limited production run and was tested at [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] early locations.<ref name="AtariMuseum">

==Development==
The original ''Snoopy Pong'' cabinet was designed by Regan Cheng of the Atari Industrial Design group. The follow-up ''Puppy Pong'' cabinet was designed by Regan's manager, Chas Grossman.<ref name="AtariMuseum" />

Both cabinets consisted of a doghouse housing a Pong board modified to not use a coin drop as a start trigger. The original ''Pong'' automatically starts several seconds after a coin is inserted. In ''Doctor Pong'' and ''Puppy Pong'', a "start button" was instead wired up to start the games, set under the vertically mounted [[television]] in the dog house "roof." Instead of a traditional control panel, spinners are mounted directly on the roof, as well.
