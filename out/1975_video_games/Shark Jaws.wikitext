'''''Shark Jaws''''' is a single-player [[arcade video game]] by [[Atari, Inc.]] under the name of Horror Games, originally released in 1975. An unlicensed tie-in to the movie ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', and believed to be the first commercially released movie tie-in, it was created to be a game about sharks eating people.<ref>{{harv|Montfort|Bogost|2009|p=125}}</ref><ref name="gamasutra">{{cite web|last=Fulton|first=Steve|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|date=2007-11-06|title=The History of Atari:1971-1977; 1975: Innovate Or Die|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2000/the_history_of_atari_19711977.php?page=10|accessdate = 2008-01-25}}</ref> Atari head [[Nolan Bushnell]] originally tried to license the ''Jaws'' name, but was unable to secure a license from [[Universal Pictures]]. Deciding to go ahead with the game anyway, it was retitled '''''Shark JAWS''''', with the word ''Shark'' in tiny print and ''JAWS'' in large all caps print to create greater prominence. Bushnell created a second hidden subsidiary corporation, Horror Games&mdash;the previous being [[Kee Games]]&mdash;to help isolate Atari from a possible lawsuit.<ref name="film license">{{cite web|last=Bogost|first=Ian|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=2007-11-13|title=Film Adaptation: The First Film License|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/film-adaptation/the-first-film-license-321910.php|accessdate=2008-01-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829175357/http://kotaku.com/321910/the-first-film-license?tag=gamingfilmadaptation|archivedate=2012-08-29}}</ref> According to Bushnell, the game was successful enough to sell approximately two thousand units.<ref name="gamasutra" />

The player controls a deep-sea diver trying to catch small fish while avoiding a [[great white shark]] that is trying to eat him. Points are scored by running over the fish to catch them.<ref name="klov">{{cite web|title = Shark JAWS Videogame by Atari (1975)|url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9509|accessdate = 2008-01-04 }}</ref>

The unrelated 1972 electromechanical arcade game ''Killer Shark'' from [[Sega]] was briefly featured in the movie ''Jaws''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10821|title=Killer Shark - Arcade by Sega}}</ref>

==Technology==
The game is housed in a custom cabinet that includes a single joystick and start button. The cabinet [[bezel (screen)|bezel]] uses blue and green colors, and portrays sharks swimming around along with a solitary swimmer. The game [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] is composed of discrete technology, and although the game was released under the name Horror Games, the PCB clearly states Atari.<ref name="bronzeage">
