{{nihongo|'''''Atomic Robo-Kid'''''|アトミック・ロボキッド}} is a horizontally scrolling shooter released in arcades by [[UPL Co., Ltd|UPL]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=6970 |title =Atomic Robo-Kid |publisher =The International Arcade Museum |accessdate =1 Nov 2013 }}</ref> In the US, the game was published by Nikom. The [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] version is an adaptation of the arcade original and published as '''''Atomic Robo-Kid Special'''''.

==Plot==
In the 21st century, a blast of cosmic [[radiation]] bombarded Terra-12, a deep-space outpost of [[Earth]], hideously [[mutation|mutating]] all transplanted life. A fleet of savage beings followed the radiation wave and invaded the planet and began the systematic destruction of all remaining sentient life. Years of battling the [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] 'governors' have gone by, and now only one hope survives to avenge the desperate terran colonists.

==Gameplay==

The player controls the titular character through six stages of increasing difficulty, facing an alien "governor" boss (which is so large as to be considered a level in and of themself, as some of the bosses take up several screens) at the end of each level, followed by a "duel" level against other Robo-Kid sized robots.  Many levels branch into others, giving the player the choice over which zone to enter next, increasing replayability.

Robo-Kid can collect four different weapons (whichever weapon is selected is lost when Robo-kid loses a life) in addition to his default [[gun]], collect powerups for a shield that activates on enemy contact, plus rapid fire and speed powerups. The player can also encounter a friendly [[dinosaur]]-looking [[robot]] that sells [[weapon]]s and shields to Robo-kid using extra lives as [[currency]].

==Ports==
The game was ported to the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], and [[X68000]].

A demo was distributed of the [[ZX Spectrum]] version <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek.cgi?regexp=^YS+issue+64%3a+Magnificent+Seven+1$&pub=^Your+Sinclair$ |title=YS issue 64: Magnificent Seven 1 - World of Spectrum |website=www.worldofspectrum.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828175823/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek.cgi?regexp=^YS+issue+64%3A+Magnificent+Seven+1$&pub=^Your+Sinclair$ |archive-date=2018-08-28}} </ref> before it was cancelled.
