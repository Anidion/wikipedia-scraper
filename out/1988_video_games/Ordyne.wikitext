{{nihongo foot|'''''Ordyne'''''|オーダイン|Ōdain|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a horizontal [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] [[arcade game]], which was released by [[Namco]] in 1988 only in [[Japan]]. It runs on [[Namco System 2]] hardware, and was ported to the [[TurboGrafx-16]] in 1989, with releases in both Japan and North America. It features a cameo from [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], as the "Stock bomber shot" - and the arcade version was also included in ''[[Namco Museum Volume 4]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]]. The TurboGrafx-16 version was released on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] on May 7, 2007 in North America and on August 21, 2007 in Japan; it is officially described by Namco as a "comical action shooter". The shopkeeper, Miyuki Chan, also appeared in a taco shop in ''[[Mach Breakers]]'' in 1994 and in a flying loudspeaker-shaped shop in ''[[Project X Zone 2]]'' in 2015.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Ordyne.png|left|thumb|A screenshot from the arcade version, showing Yūichirō confronting the game's first boss.]]
The players take control of the genius scientist {{nihongo|'''Yūichirō Tomari'''|泊裕一郎|Tomari Yūichirō}} and his [[China|Chinese]] assistant {{nihongo|'''Sunday Chin'''|サンデー珍|Sandē Chin}} as they attempt to rescue Tomari's fiancée, {{nihongo|'''Kana Aibara'''|相原香奈|Aibara Kana}} from the evil {{nihongo|'''Dr. Kubota'''|Dr. クボタ|Dokutā Kubota}} and his army of robotic minions. The enemies all follow preset patterns, and killing a group of smaller ones or a larger one leaves crystals behind that can be collected and exchanged for special weapons, extra lives, and even more crystals at the "Kūchū IN" run by the blue-haired woman {{nihongo|'''Miyuki-chan'''|みゆきちゃん|Miyuki Chan}} and by firing out marbles at the extendable rotating target of the big white-handed robot {{nihongo|'''Dream Co., Ltd.'''|夢有限会社|Yūme Yūgengaisha}}. This game has a total of seven rounds, and a boss is fought at the end of each one. One hit will kill Yūichirō and Sunday, unless either of them has the "Stock bomber shot", as Pac-Man and the shield he is generating will protect them from death for one non-projectile hit. They can either earn or buy extra lives. This game also features voice samples (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]).
