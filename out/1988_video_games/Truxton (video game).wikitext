'''''Truxton'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''Tatsujin'''''|{{ruby|達人|タツジン}}||lead=yes|"Expert" or "Master"}} in Japan.}} is a 1988 [[Shoot 'em up#Types|vertically scrolling shooter]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] originally developed by [[Toaplan]] and published in Japan and Europe by [[Taito]], as well as in North America by [[Midway Games|Midway]]. Set in a future where the Gidans alien race led by Dogurava invaded the fictional planet Borogo, players assume the role of [[fighter pilot]] Tatsuo taking control of the Super Fighter ship on a last-ditch effort to overthrow the alien invaders.

''Truxton'' was conceived by Masahiro Yuge during his time working at Toaplan, who wanted to create a scrolling shooter where memorization was its main focus, inheriting previously established ideas from ''[[Slap Fight]]'' and was developed in conjunction with ''[[Hellfire (video game)|Hellfire]]'', although work on the project had already started privately during production of ''[[Twin Cobra]]''.

''Truxton'' proved to be a commercial success for Toaplan among players in Japanese arcades, earning several awards from ''[[Gamest]]'' magazine, however it was less successful in western regions and was met with mixed reception from game magazines. The game has since been released on multiple [[Video game#Platforms|platforms]], each one featuring changes and additions compared to the original version. A sequel, ''[[Truxton II]]'', was released in 1992 on arcades. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Yuge.

== Gameplay ==

''Truxton'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game where players assume the role of Tatsuo taking control of the Super Fighter ship through five increasingly difficult levels, each with a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be fought, in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the invading Gidans led by Dogurava as the main objective.<ref name="TXNGENmanual">''Truxton'' instruction manual (Sega Genesis, US)</ref><ref name="TXNhg101">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/truxton/|title=Truxton|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=7 August 2017|access-date=2019-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725063017/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/truxton/|archive-date=25 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving.

== Development ==
''Truxton'' was the creation of former Toaplan [[Video game programmer|programmer]] Masahiro Yuge, whose previous development works at the company included ''[[Tiger-Heli]]'', ''Slap Fight'' and ''Twin Cobra'', becoming his first original project under the role of both [[Video game producer|producer]] and [[Video game composer|composer]].<ref name="PSGv10">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=東亜プランインタビュー|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=F.S.G Club|date=September 1989|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name="VGMDB">{{cite web|url=https://vgmdb.net/album/5540|title=H24X-10005 &#124; TATSUJIN ~TOA PLAN GAME MUSIC SCENE ONE~|work=vgmdb.net|publisher=VGMdb|access-date=2020-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508223350/https://vgmdb.net/album/5540|archive-date=8 May 2019|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplanmusic/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022183049/http://shmuplations.com/toaplanmusic/|date=2019-10-22}}).</ref><ref name="BTGwMY">{{cite journal|title=Behind The Game with Masahiro Yuge: Truxton|journal=Toaplan Shooter's Collector's Edition|publisher=Retro-Bit|date=2020|pages=1–5}}</ref> Yuge wanted to create a scrolling shooter game where players would become increasingly better at the more they were able to remember specific stage designs and secrets, focusing on creating sections in levels that required a specific weapon to defeat certain enemies, while [[Tatsuya Uemura]] stated that the project was developed in conjunction with ''Hellfire''.<ref name="TFf25v9">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|date=June 2009|pages=1–70|lang=ja}} ([https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201010170328/https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332|date=2020-10-10}}).</ref><ref name="TSCb">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル 特設ページ|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-02-27|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref>
