== Gameplay ==
The player controls a robot with a bat attempting to hit a ball at a circular target on the opposing wall. Alternatively, the player may try to kill the opponent by hitting it with the ball or bat. The computer-controlled opposing player is trying to do the same.

As the game progresses more balls are brought into play, up to a limit of four. A round is won when one player scores three goals or kills the opponent.

There are 26 levels of varying difficulty. Later levels feature movable barriers and various other obstacles to complicate play.
