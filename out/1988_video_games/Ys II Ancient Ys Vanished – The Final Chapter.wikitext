{{nihongo foot|'''''Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished – The Final Chapter'''''|イースII|Īsu Tsū}} is a 1988 [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[Nihon Falcom]]. It is a sequel to ''[[Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished]]'' and takes place immediately following it. The game first released for the [[PC-8801]] and [[PC-9801]] and has seen several ports and remakes since.

Picking up almost immediately after the events of the first game, the story opens with Adol being transported to the titular civilization, which is now a floating island in the heavens. There, Adol learns the truth behind the first game's events, being part of a larger conspiracy orchestrated by a greater evil, as well as the kingdom of Ys itself. 

''Ys II'' was later adapted into the [[anime]] ''[[Ys (anime)|Ys II: Castle in the Heavens]]'' (1992). [[Dotemu|DotEmu]] has released the game on Android with the following localizations: English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Japanese and Chinese.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ys Chronicles II (The Final Chapter)|url=https://www.dotemu.com/game/ys-chronicles/|access-date=2020-12-12|website=Dotemu|language=fr-FR}}</ref>

==Versions==
Like its predecessor, ''Ys II'' was ported to various other platforms following its first release, such as the [[FM-7]], [[X1 (computer)|X1]], [[MSX2]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]].

It was released along with its predecessor as part of the enhanced compilation, ''[[Ys I & II]]'', for the [[TurboGrafx-16#CD-ROM add-ons|TurboGrafx-CD]] by [[Hudson Soft]] in 1989.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=3242|title=イース I・II [PCエンジン] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref> For many years this was the only version of ''Ys II'' that received an official English release.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-02-09-chronicles-of-ys-a-series-retrospective|title=Chronicles of Ys: A Series Retrospective|last=Massey|first=Tom|website=[[eurogamer.net]]|date=9 February 2014 |publisher=Gamer Network}}</ref>

An [[MS-DOS]] remake called ''Ys II Special'', developed by Mantra, was released exclusively for the [[Video gaming in South Korea|South Korean market]] in 1994. It was a mash-up of ''Ys II'' with the [[anime]] ''[[Ys (anime)|Ys II: Castle in the Heavens]]'' (1992) along with a large amount of new content, including more secrets than any other version of the game. The game was a success in Korea, despite competition from the [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Korean RPG]] ''[[Astonishia Story]]'' that same year.<ref name="gtm_falcom_157">{{cite journal|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=Falcom: Legacy of Ys|journal=[[GamesTM|Games<sup>TM</sup>]]|date=7 July 2011|issue=111|pages=152–159 [157]|url=http://imageshack.us/f/718/yshistory06.jpg/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710170517/http://imageshack.us/f/718/yshistory06.jpg/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012|access-date=2011-09-09}} ([[cf.]] {{cite web|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=History of Ys interviews|url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/07/history-of-ys-interviews-by-john.html|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=9 September 2011|date=July 8, 2011}})</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=Falcom: Legacy of Ys|journal=[[GamesTM|Games<sup>TM</sup>]]|date=7 July 2011|issue=111|pages=152–159 [158]|url=http://imageshack.us/f/841/yshistory07.jpg/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709121419/http://imageshack.us/f/841/yshistory07.jpg/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2012|access-date=2011-09-10}} ([[cf.]] {{cite web|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=History of Ys interviews|url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/07/history-of-ys-interviews-by-john.html|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=10 September 2011|date=July 8, 2011}})</ref>

Years later, a third remake was released for [[Microsoft Windows]]-based PCs as ''Ys II Eternal'', and later as ''Ys II Complete''. Versions of the game have also been developed for mobile phone platforms.

''Ys II'' was also remade in 2008 for the [[Nintendo DS]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Ys II - IGN.com|url=http://ds.ign.com/objects/142/14214091.html|language=en|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=3225|title=イースII DS [DS] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref> An English translation of this version was released by [[Atlus]] in North America, along with the DS version of ''Ys I'' on a single card, as ''Legacy of Ys: Books I & II'' in 2009.<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/data/954798.html GameFAQs release information for Legacy of Ys: Books I & II DS]</ref> The Japanese version had been released as a single game when it came out in 2008.<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/data/943853.html GameFAQs release information for Ys II DS]</ref>

==Plot==
''Ys II'' picks up immediately where ''Ys I'' left off. Adol Christin is transported to the floating island of Ys, where he meets a young woman named Lilia. She takes Adol to her home, Lance Village. It is here that he will begin his quest to unravel the secrets of Ys, and finally, rid it and Esteria of evil.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Adol as he battles his way across the land of Ys. As in the first game, Adol's strength is measured in a typical RPG fashion: he has numerical statistics such as HP, attack power, and defense power that determine his strength. These stats are increased by raising his experience level through battling.

Also returning from the first game is the 'bump' combat system. The player attacks enemies by running into them, and the enemy takes damage according to Adol's stats, the enemy's stats, Adol's position, and the enemy's position. A new addition to ''Ys II'' is the magic system: Adol can acquire several different spells he can use throughout the course of play, such as a fire spell for attack and a time spell which can stop enemies as long as it is active. The use of magic consumes Adol's MP stat. Another major change in combat in this game compared to the previous game is that the bump combat system cannot be used against most bosses. Crashing into all but two of the bosses in this game in an attempt to damage them will only result in Adol taking damage. These bosses must be defeated with the fire spell.

==Music==
The soundtrack to ''Ys II'' was composed by [[Yuzo Koshiro]], [[:jp:石川三恵子|Mieko Ishikawa]], and Hideya Nagata.

Several music CDs dedicated to the music of ''Ys II'' have been released by Falcom. They include:
* '''''Music from Ys II''''' (1988): Contains the soundtrack to the original PC-8801 edition of ''Ys II'', along with four ''Ys II'' tracks arranged by [[Hiroyuki Namba]] and one vocal track.
* '''''Perfect Collection Ys II''''' (1990): A two-CD set, the first of which is a complete arrangement of the ''Ys II'' soundtrack by Ryo Yonemitsu. The second disc contains assorted arrangements from ''Ys I'', ''II'' and ''III''.
* '''''Music from Ys II Renewal''''' (1995): The entire ''Ys II'' soundtrack, reproduced on more advanced synthesizer equipment.
