== Plot ==
On June 6, 1999, a team of [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] discovered an ancient doorway that, when unintentionally opened, awakened [[Baal]], a forgotten demonic entity, and his army of evil creatures. Baal's army storms the humans and manages to seize a weapon of war that allows their master to rule over and [[Slavery|enslave]] humanity. In desperation, humanity holds a [[council of war]] that plans a counterattack to recover the stolen weapon and eliminate Baal. It is decided to create the Time Warriors,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|title=To Hell And Baal|pages=43|work=[[The Games Machine]]|url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_828_pages|access-date=January 15, 2021}}</ref> a futuristic combat unit that must infiltrate, by [[teleportation]],<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=Caberia|first=Eric|title=Baal|language=French|pages=56–57|work=[[Tilt (French magazine)|Tilt]]|issue=63|publication-date=February 1989|url=https://archive.org/details/Tilt063/page/n55/mode/2up|access-date=January 15, 2021}}</ref> the enemy's lair.

== Gameplay ==
The player takes on the role of the Time Warriors' leader and must progress through levels in [[Scrolling|multi-directional scrolling]] profile view. The player must eliminate monsters with a laser gun while avoiding traps, including landmines, energy barriers and precipices that hinder progress. To advance through the levels, the player must disable the energy barriers by first destroying the energy generators that power them. This involves memorizing the locations to be destroyed and performing the appropriate action sequences to progress through the game.<ref name=":1" /> In addition, progressing through the enemy lair requires collecting the components of the stolen weapon that have been scattered throughout the levels.<ref name=":0" /> Progression is also achieved by controlling a Back Reactor vehicle.

Other items are also scattered throughout the game and can be collected. This is particularly the case for the laser rifle, whose power can be increased by collecting power units. The laser rifle may also need to be recharged at a terminal after intensive use.<ref name=":0" />

French magazine ''[[Tilt (French magazine)|Tilt]]'' praised the quality of achievement, the labyrinth-like progression system of the game, its Satanic atmosphere, as well as the richness of the bestiary.<ref name=":1" /> The gameplay is compared to ''[[Obliterator]],'' an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] title developed by [[Psygnosis]] and released in 1988.

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' considered that the search for and deactivation of the energy doors gives the game [[Puzzle video game|puzzle elements]]. [[Julian Rignall]]  described the soundtrack as one of the best ever heard on the [[Atari ST]]. The game's save system, which was not very common at the time, was also praised.<ref name=":0" />
