'''''Amagon''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Totsuzen! Machoman'''''|突然! マッチョマン|lit. ''Suddenly! Machoman''}}, is a [[side-scrolling]] platform action game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] developed by [[Aicom]].

==Synopsis==
In the game, players take the role of Amagon, a [[Marines|Marine]] who is trapped on an island after his plane crashed.<ref name="mobygames"/> Inconveniently, his rescue ship is on the other side of the island, which Amagon must now cross on foot.

The storyline used for the original Japanese release was somewhat different. The main character is a scientist named "Jackson" who transforms into his "Macho Man" form by using the special drug "Macho Max" that has been taken from his plane by the creatures of "Monster Island".<ref name="Totsuzen Machoman Wikipedia page">[[:ja:突然! マッチョマン|''Totsuzen! Machoman'']]</ref>

==Gameplay==

Amagon encounters a variety of enemies which he can dispose of with his [[rifle]].  He also has the ability (upon collecting and then activating the Mega-Key) to transform into a larger, stronger version of himself called "Megagon".<ref name="mobygames"/> Upon transformation, Megagon is given 1 hit point for every 5,000 points he scored as Amagon (whereas a single hit from any enemy or hazard will kill Amagon). Megagon cannot use the machine gun, but instead has a punch which does eight times the damage and never runs out of ammo. At the cost of one hit point each, he can also fire waves of energy from his chest; these are much broader than machine gun shots, do 16 times the damage, and can hit multiple enemies in a single blast.

The last boss in the game is based on the [[Flatwoods monster]], a supposed space alien seen in [[Flatwoods, West Virginia]] on September 12, 1952.<ref name="mobygames"/>
