'''''Microsoft Flight Simulator''''', commonly known as '''''Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0''''' or '''''FS3''''', is a flight simulator video game. It was released in mid-1988 for the [[MS-DOS]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=1988 |title=PC Mag 31 Out 1988 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VKjwnGrhNwC&dq=%22%22Microsoft+Flight+Simulator+3%22&pg=PA508}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Msfs3.png|thumb|'''FS 3.0''' – Many more buildings and additional aircraft. For the first time, users had an option to view the aircraft from the outside. A Cessna Skylane flying over [[Chicago]] is shown here.]]
''Microsoft Flight Simulator 3'' improved the flight experience by adding additional aircraft and airports to the simulated area found in ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2.0]]'', as well as improved high-res ([[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]]) graphics, and other features lifted from the [[Amiga]]/[[Atari ST|ST]] versions.

The three simulated aircraft were the [[Gates Learjet 25]], [[Cessna 182|Cessna Skylane]], and [[Sopwith Camel]]. ''Flight Simulator 3'' also allowed the user to customize the display; multiple windows, each displaying one of several views, could be positioned and sized on the screen. The supported views included the instrument and control panel, a map view, and various external camera angles.

This version included a program to convert the old series of [[Sublogic]] Scenery Disks into scenery files (known as SCN files), which could then be copied to the FS3 directory, allowing the user to expand the FS world.

==Reception==

If you're new to the hangar, this is the package to start with."''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1989-04-compute-magazine|title=Compute!

Steve Williams for ''[[Family Computing]]'' said ''"The graphics of Version 3.0 look better; the game system allows for more flexibility; and the improved planes give flying aces fresh challenges while the new options help novice pilots ease into flying.
