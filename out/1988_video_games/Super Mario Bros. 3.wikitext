'''''Super Mario Bros. 3'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|'''''Super Mario Bros. 3'''''|スーパーマリオブラザーズ3|Sūpā Mario Burazāzu 3}}}} is a 1988 [[Platformer|platform game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). It was released for home consoles in Japan on October 23, 1988, in North America on February 12, 1990 and in Europe on August 29, 1991. It was developed by [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development|Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]], led by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Takashi Tezuka]].

Players control brothers [[Mario]] or [[Luigi]], who must save [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and the rulers of seven different kingdoms from the antagonist [[Bowser]]. As in previous Mario games, they defeat enemies by stomping on them or using [[item (gaming)|items]] that bestow magical powers; they also have new abilities, including flight and sliding down slopes. ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' introduced many elements that became ''[[Super Mario]]'' staples, such as Bowser's children (the [[Koopalings]]) and a [[Overworld|world map]] to transition between [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].

''Super Mario Bros. 3'' was praised by critics for its challenging gameplay and is regarded as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. It is the [[List of best-selling Nintendo Entertainment System video games|third-best-selling NES game]], with more than 17&nbsp;million copies sold worldwide. It also inspired an animated television series, ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', produced by [[DIC Entertainment]].

''Super Mario Bros. 3'' was [[Video game remake|remade]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] as a part of ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' in 1993 and for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as ''[[Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' in 2003. It was rereleased on the [[Virtual Console]] service on the Wii U and 3DS, and was included on the [[NES Classic Mini]]. On September 19, 2018, it was rereleased on the [[Nintendo Switch Online]] service with added netplay.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Super Mario Bros 3 Gameplay.png|thumb|left|An example of gameplay in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', in which Mario uses the Super Leaf to ascend into the air]]
''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is a [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]], [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] platform game in which the player controls either [[Mario]] or [[Luigi]]. The game shares similar gameplay mechanics with previous games in the series {{emdash}} ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' {{emdash}} while introducing several new elements. In addition to the running and jumping found in previous games, the player character can slide down slopes, pick up and throw certain items, and freely climb vines. New [[power-up]]s are introduced, including the Super Leaf and the Tanooki Suit, which allow Mario to fly and float.<ref name="StrategyGuide-1">{{cite magazine |year=1990 |title=Mario's Basic Moves |url=https://archive.org/stream/Nintendo_Power_Issue001-Issue127/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20013%20Mario%203%20Strategy#page/n3/mode/2up |magazine=Nintendo Power: Strategy Guide |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |volume=SG1 |issue=13 |page=4}}</ref> The game world consists of eight kingdoms, each subdivided into multiple [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The eight worlds feature distinct visual themes: the first world is grass and the second world, "Desert Land" (or "Desert Hill" in Japanese and North American PRG0 versions), contains sand-covered levels with pyramids, while the levels in the fourth world, "Giant Land" ("Big Island"), contain obstacles and enemies twice their normal height and width.<ref name="Manual-2">{{cite book |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAACE.pdf |title=Super Mario Bros. 3 Instruction Booklet |date=February 12, 1990 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] of America |pages=30–34 |access-date=February 16, 2020 |archive-date=November 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105110431/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAACE.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The player navigates through the game via two game screens: an [[overworld]] map and a course. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current kingdom and has several paths leading from the world's entrance to a castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, and other map icons, and allow players to take different routes to reach the kingdom's goal. Moving the on-screen character to an action panel or fortress will allow access to that course, a linear stage populated with obstacles and enemies. The majority of the game takes place in these levels, with the player traversing the stage by dashing, jumping, flying, swimming, and dodging or defeating enemies.<ref name="MeanMachines">{{Cite magazine |title=Nintendo Review: ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' |date=October 1991 |magazine=[[Mean Machines]] |publisher=[[EMAP]] |author=Mean Machine Staff |issue=13 |pages=56–59 |url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/review/192/super-mario-bros-3.php |access-date=October 26, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226003426/http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/review/192/super-mario-bros-3.php |archive-date=February 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="NP-10-Preview">{{Cite magazine |author=Nintendo Power Staff |date=January–February 1990 |title=Previews: ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' |url=https://archive.org/stream/Nintendo_Power_Issue001-Issue127/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20010%20January-February%201990#page/n57/mode/2up |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |issue=10 |pages=56–59}}</ref> Players start with a certain number of [[life (video games)|lives]] and may gain additional lives by picking up green spotted [[1-Up]] mushrooms hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, among other methods. Mario and Luigi lose a life if they take damage while small, fall into lava or a bottomless pit, or run out of time. The game [[Game over|ends prematurely]] when all lives are lost, although the player can continue from the beginning of the world they lost their last life in by selecting "[[Continue (video gaming)|Continue]]". If the player chooses to continue, all fortresses and enemy courses, as well as the tank and ship levels from the eighth world that the player previously completed will remain completed and any locked doors that were unlocked will also remain unlocked. This allows the player to continue from the last fortress level they completed in most cases. The player will also be able to keep all of their items in their inventory.

Completing stages allows the player to progress through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world features a final stage with a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] to defeat. The first seven worlds feature an airship controlled by one of the Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world as the Final Boss. Other map icons include large boulders and locked doors that impede paths. Mini-games and bonus screens on the map provide the player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are stored in a reserve, and can be activated by the player from the map screen.<ref name="MeanMachines" /><ref name="NP-10-Preview" />

In addition to special items from previous games like the [[Super Mario#Mushrooms|Super Mushroom]], Super Star, and the Fire Flower, new power-ups are introduced that provide the player with new options. The Super Leaf and [[Japanese raccoon dog|Tanooki]] Suit give Mario raccoon and tanooki appearances respectively, allowing him to fly for a short period of time. The Tanooki Suit also enables him to turn into Statue Mario to avoid enemies for a short period of time. Changing into a Tanooki statue while jumping results in Mario pounding the ground and killing whatever enemies are directly under him; this is the first appearance of the now standard "ground pound" move in the ''Mario'' series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/super-mario-3d-land/Ground_Pound |title=Ground Pound – Super Mario World 3D |access-date=June 28, 2014 |website=IGN |date=November 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730040030/http://www.ign.com/wikis/super-mario-3d-land/Ground_Pound |archive-date=July 30, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The new "Frog Suit" highly increases the character's underwater speed and agility, and boosts jumping height on land. Another new suit, the Hammer Suit, gives Mario the appearance of the [[Hammer Bro.]] enemy and allows him to throw hammers at enemies and resist fire attacks when crouching.

''Super Mario Bros. 3'' includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] option which allows two players to play the game by taking turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels. The first player controls Mario, while the other controls Luigi (a [[palette swap]] of Mario). Through this mode, players can access several mini-games, including a remake of the original ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' arcade game, in which one player has the opportunity to steal the cards of another, but may lose their turn if they lose the mini-game.<ref name="Manual-3">{{cite book |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAACE.pdf |title=Super Mario Bros. 3 Instruction Booklet |date=February 12, 1990 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] of America |pages=27 |chapter=How To Play The 2 Player Game |access-date=February 16, 2020 |archive-date=November 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105110431/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAACE.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Plot and characters ==
{{Further|Characters in the Mario franchise}}

The plot of ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is described in the instruction booklet. The [[Mushroom World]], the setting of the game, is invaded by the [[Koopalings]], [[Bowser]]'s seven children. The Koopalings conquer each of the seven kingdoms by stealing its king's magical [[wand]] and using it to transform him into an animal. [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] sends [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] to travel to each kingdom, retrieve the stolen wand, and restore its king to normal.<ref name="smb3 manual">{{cite book|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAACE.pdf|title=Super Mario Bros. 3 manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|year=1990|location=USA|page=5|access-date=February 16, 2020|archive-date=November 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105110431/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAACE.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Mario and Luigi receive notes and special items from Princess Toadstool after rescuing each of the first six kings. When they rescue the seventh king, they instead receive a note from Bowser, boasting that he has kidnapped Toadstool and imprisoned her within the castle of his own realm, Dark Land.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Super Mario Bros. 3 |developer=Nintendo |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=February 12, 1990 |platform=[[Nintendo Entertainment System]] |level=World 7 castle |quote='''Bowser:''' Yo!

According to [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' was conceived as a [[stage play]]. The title screen features a [[stage curtain]] being drawn open, and in the original NES version, in-game objects hang from off-screen catwalks, are bolted to the background, or cast shadows on the skyline. When Mario finishes a level, he walks off the stage.<ref name="Stage play">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/miyamoto-confirms-that-super-mario-bros-3-was-a-play-1729805751|website=[[Kotaku]]|title=Miyamoto Confirms That Super Mario Bros. 3 Was A Play|last=Schreier|first=Jason|date=September 10, 2015|access-date=September 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911111326/http://kotaku.com/miyamoto-confirms-that-super-mario-bros-3-was-a-play-1729805751|archive-date=September 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Development and release ==

Developer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] served as director. He worked closely with the designers and programmers during the conceptual and final stages, encouraging a free interchange of ideas. Miyamoto considered intriguing and original ideas to be key to creating a successful game.<ref name="NP-10-Develop" /> Originally, the team intended for the game to be played from an isometric point of view, but the developers found that this made it too difficult to position jumps, so the game was changed to the 2D side view used in previous games. Some isometric elements remain, such as the checkered floor present in the title screen.<ref name="NES Classic" /> All pixel art for the game was drawn using Fujitsu FM R-50 HD business computers while [[HP 64000]] mainframe computers with a 6502 processor card were used to write and test code.<ref name="SMB3 Dev">{{cite book |last=Murata |first=Eiichi  |title=The Stars of Famicom Games |year=1989 |script-title=ja:社会科 はこばれてくるしくみシリーズ―11 ファミコンゲームの主役たち ゲームソフトの制作と流通|trans-title=The Stars of Famicom Games |url=https://archive.org/details/The-Stars-of-Famicom-Games/mode/2up |language=ja |location=Japan |publisher= Nintendo, PHP Institute }}</ref>

The game was designed to appeal to players of varying skill levels. To assist less-to no skill players, bonus coins and [[Life (video games)#Extra lives|1-up]]s are more abundant in earlier worlds, while later worlds present more complex challenges for experienced players. In the two-player mode, the players alternate turns to balance play time.<ref name="NP-10-Develop" /> The development team introduced new power-ups and concepts that would give Mario the appearance of different creatures as a means of providing him with new abilities. An early idea changed Mario into a [[centaur]], but was dropped in favor of a raccoon tail with limited flying ability.<ref name="IGN-100" /><ref name="NP-10-Develop" /> Other costumes with different abilities were added to his repertoire, and levels were designed to take advantage of these abilities.<ref name="IGN-MarioHistory">{{cite web| url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/ign-presents-the-history-of-super-mario-bros| title = IGN Presents: The History of the Super Mario Bros.| website = IGN| first = Rus| last = McLaughlin| date = November 8, 2007| access-date = May 3, 2022| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120217164813/http://retro.ign.com/articles/833/833615p2.html| archive-date = February 17, 2012| url-status = live| df = mdy-all}}</ref> New enemies were included to add diversity to the game, along with variants of previous enemies, such as [[Goomba]]s, Hammer Bros., and [[Koopa Troopa]]s.<ref name="IGN-100" /><ref name="IGN-MarioHistory" />

Some of the enemies designed for ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' were inspired by the team's personal experiences. For example, the [[Chain Chomp]] enemy, a barking tethered [[ball and chain]] creature with eyes and teeth that lunges at the player when in close proximity, was drawn from Miyamoto's early life, in which a dog lunged at him, but was pulled away from him.<ref name="NP-10-Develop" /> Bowser's children, the [[Koopalings]], were designed to be unique in appearance and personality; Miyamoto based the characters on seven of his programmers as a tribute to their work and efforts.<ref name="IGN-100" /><ref name="NP-10-Develop" /> Nintendo of America named the Koopalings after well-known musicians: for example, the characters "Ludwig von Koopa" and "Roy Koopa" are named after [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Roy Orbison]] respectively.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16520/features/10-amazing-mario-facts/ |title=Nintendo Feature: 10 Amazing Mario Facts |magazine=Official Nintendo Magazine |date=April 30, 2010 |access-date=August 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603174405/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16520/features/10-amazing-mario-facts/ |archive-date=June 3, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The character graphics were created with a special graphics machine ("Character Generator Computer Aided Design") that generated a collection of the graphical shapes used in the game. Shapes in the collection were assigned numbers that the game's [[Source code|code]] used to access and combine to form complete images on the screen in real time.<ref name="NP-10-Develop" /> The ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] uses Nintendo's custom [[memory management controller#MMC3|MMC3]] ASIC to enhance the NES capabilities. The MMC3 chip allows for animated tiles, extra RAM for diagonal scrolling, and a scan line timer to [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split the screen]]. The game uses these functions to split the game screen into two portions, a playfield on the top and a status bar on the bottom. On the overworld map, the status bar doubles as an inventory for items and power-ups. This allows the top portion to scroll as the character navigates the stage while the bottom portion remains static to display text and other information.<ref name="NP-20">{{Cite magazine|date=January 1991| author = Nintendo Power Staff| title = Why Your Game Paks Never Forget| magazine = [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher=[[Nintendo]]| issue = 20| pages = 28–31}}</ref>

Like its predecessors, the music in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' was composed by [[Koji Kondo]], who composed several new songs as well as returning melodies from ''Super Mario Bros.'' According to Kondo, who had composed the music in ''Super Mario Bros.'' based on what he believed fit the levels rather than focusing on composing a specific genre of music, the game was the most difficult game for him to compose.<ref name="Mario's Maestro">{{cite web |url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/koji-kondo-interview-nintendo |title=Super Mario's Maestro: A Q&A with Nintendo's Koji Kondo |first=Bob |last=Mackey |date=December 10, 2014 |publisher=US Games |access-date=February 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063018/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/koji-kondo-interview-nintendo |archive-date=February 9, 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Kondo experimented with several different genres of music, unsure of how to follow up the music from the first game after hearing from several people that it sounded a lot like [[Latin music|Latin]] or [[fusion music]],<ref name="NES Classic" /> and came up with several different melodies throughout its development before settling on what ultimately made it into the game.<ref name="Mario's Maestro" /> The development team decided that music on the title screen was unnecessary.<ref name="Mario's Maestro" />

During 1988, a shortage of ROM chips,<ref name="Shortage of Memory">{{cite news | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=Shortage of Memory Chips Has Industry Scrambling | first=Andrew | last=Pollack | date=March 12, 1988 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/12/us/shortage-of-memory-chips-has-industry-scrambling.html | access-date=July 19, 2019 | archive-date=March 23, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220323122612/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/12/us/shortage-of-memory-chips-has-industry-scrambling.html | url-status=live }}</ref> along with Nintendo's preparation of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', prevented Nintendo from performing various North American game releases according to their original schedules. The delayed products included ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' and, according to ''Nintendo Power'', ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]''.<ref>{{cite book| year=1993| last=Sheff| first=David| author-link=David Sheff| chapter=Game Masters| page=[https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/222 222]| title=[[Game Over (Sheff book)|Game Over: How Nintendo Zapped an American Industry, Captured Your Dollars, and Enslaved Your Children]]| publisher=[[Random House]]| isbn=0-679-40469-4}}</ref> The delay, however, presented Nintendo with an opportunity to promote the game in a feature film. In 1989, Tom Pollack of [[Universal Studios]] approached Nintendo of America's marketing department about a video game movie; inspired by Nintendo [[Electronic sports|video game competitions]], Pollack envisioned a video game version of ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'' for younger audiences. Nintendo licensed its products for inclusion in what would become the film ''[[The Wizard (1989 film)|The Wizard]]''. During the movie's production, the filmmakers requested and were granted approval from Nintendo regarding the script and the portrayal of the company's games.<ref name="GO-Wizard">{{cite book| year=1993| last=Sheff| first=David| author-link=David Sheff| chapter=The Grinch Who Stole Christmas| pages=[https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/190 190–191]| title=[[Game Over (Sheff book)|Game Over: How Nintendo Zapped an American Industry, Captured Your Dollars, and Enslaved Your Children]]| publisher=[[Random House]]| isbn=0-679-40469-4}}</ref> ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' was one of the products shown in the film and was used in a final scene involving a video game competition.<ref name="GO-Wizard" /><ref>{{cite magazine| magazine = [[Retro Gamer]]| title = The Making of The Wizard| first = Damien| last = McFerran|date=April 2008| publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]| issue = 49| pages = 84–87}}</ref> The film was released in December 1989, between the home console releases of the game in Japan and North America.<ref name="NP-9-b">{{Cite magazine| magazine = [[Nintendo Power]]| title = NES Journal: The Wizard| first = Michele| last = Matti| issue = 9|date=November–December 1989| page = 90| publisher = [[Nintendo]]}}</ref>

Boone commented that the game is nearly flawless in its utterly "stupendous incredibility and absolutely impossible to put down for anything less than a fire alarm and even then you find yourself weighing down the odds." Rand called ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' the best video game ever, labeling it "the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' of gaming" and stating that it is "astoundingly brilliant in every way, shape, and form." O'Connor stated that the game "makes ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' look like a wet Sunday morning and even gives the Super Famicom's ''[[Super Mario World]]'' a run for its money."<ref name=cvg />

A second ''Mean Machines'' reviewer, Matt Regan, anticipated the game would be a bestseller in the United Kingdom, and echoed Rignall's praise, calling it a "truly brilliant game". Regan further stated that the game offered elements which tested the player's "brains and reflexes", and that though the graphics were simple, they were "incredibly varied".<ref name="MeanMachines" /> In a preview of the game, ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' gave it high marks in graphics, audio, challenge, gameplay, and enjoyability.<ref name="NP-10-Preview" /> The items hidden in the game's levels, such as the [[warp (gaming)|warp whistles]], were well-received: Rignall regarded them as part of the game's addictiveness, and Sheff stated that finding them provided a sense of satisfaction.<ref name="MeanMachines" /><ref>{{cite book|title=[[Game Over (Sheff book)|Game Over: How Nintendo Zapped an American Industry, Captured Your Dollars, and Enslaved Your Children]]|last=Sheff|first=David|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=1993|isbn=0-679-40469-4|edition=1st|page=[https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/53 53]|chapter=I, Mario|author-link=David Sheff}}</ref>

Criticism focused on particular aspects of the game. Rignall described the audio and visuals as being outdated in comparison to games on the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (the latter platform having already been launched in other regions by the time ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' was released in Europe).<ref name="MeanMachines" />

''Super Mario Bros. 3'' introduced several elements carried over to subsequent ''Mario'' games.<ref name="100-ONM" /> A similar overworld map is used in ''Super Mario World'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. DX]]''  and ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'', and Mario's ability to fly has been a feature in games such as ''[[Super Mario World]]'', ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''.<ref name="IGN-100" /><ref name="playersguide">{{cite book|year=1996|title=Official Super Mario 64 Player's Guide|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url =https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/06/new-super-mario-bros| title = New Super Mario Bros.| first = Craig| last = Harris| date = May 6, 2006| website = IGN| access-date = May 3, 2022| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090202194503/http://ds.ign.com/articles/705/705537p2.html| archive-date = February 2, 2009| url-status = live| df = mdy-all}}</ref> The game's "Super Leaf" item has returned in more recent ''Mario'' games for the [[Nintendo 3DS]], like ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'' and  ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]''.

Through a collaboration between [[NBC]] and Nintendo of America, an animated television series, ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]],'' was created from September to December 1990 by [[DIC Entertainment]]. The show aired weekly on Saturday mornings on NBC alongside the second season of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'' as part of the hour-long ''Captain N & The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3'' programming block with 26 episodes and featured numerous characters, enemies, and settings from the video game; the original seven Koopalings are given different names based on their given personalities and are also given a new age order.<ref name="NP-16-TV">{{Cite magazine| magazine = [[Nintendo Power]]| title = On the Air: SMB3| author= Nintendo Power Staff| issue = 16|date=September–October 1990| page = 89| publisher = [[Nintendo]]}}</ref> Other Nintendo products have included various elements of the game as well.

In the early 1990s, game developers [[John Carmack]] and [[Tom Hall]] developed an [[IBM PC]] clone of ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' based on their innovative [[adaptive tile refresh]] software that performs smooth, side-scrolling graphics on [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] cards. They demonstrated it to Nintendo leaders, who were impressed with the demo but rejected cloning in favor of exclusivity.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/14/10123754/john-romero-super-mario-bros-3-pc-demo | title = Doom dev shares rare Super Mario Bros. 3 PC demo | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = December 14, 2015 | access-date = July 13, 2021 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-date = July 13, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210713212017/https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/14/10123754/john-romero-super-mario-bros-3-pc-demo | url-status = live }}</ref> Carmack and Hall went on to found [[id Software]] and develop ''[[Commander Keen]]'', a series of platform games inspired by ''Super Mario Bros. 3.''<ref name="Masters of Doom">{{Cite book|title=Masters of Doom: how two guys created an empire and transformed pop culture|url=https://archive.org/details/mastersofdoom00kush|url-access=limited|last=Kushner|first=David|publisher=Random House, Inc|year=2004|isbn=978-0-375-50524-9|location=New York, NY|page=[https://archive.org/details/mastersofdoom00kush/page/n49 50], 57|oclc=50129329|orig-year=2003}}</ref><ref name="SMB3 demo at Ars">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/12/heres-what-id-softwares-pc-port-of-mario-3-could-have-looked-like/|title=Here's what id Software's PC port of Mario 3 could have looked like|last=Orland|first=Kyle|date=December 14, 2015|website=Ars Technica|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310162034/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/12/heres-what-id-softwares-pc-port-of-mario-3-could-have-looked-like/|archive-date=March 10, 2016|access-date=December 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://planetromero.com/games/dangerous-dave-in-copyright-infringement/|title=''Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement'' on John Romero's Site|publisher=[[John Romero]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713175911/http://planetromero.com/games/dangerous-dave-in-copyright-infringement|archive-date=July 13, 2014|access-date=December 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Keen">{{cite news|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/keenhistory/index.html|title=A Look Back at Commander Keen|date=October 18, 2014|access-date=October 18, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110132009/http://legacy.3drealms.com/keenhistory/index.html|archive-date=November 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name="SMB3 demo at IFD">{{cite AV media|title=Super Mario Bros. 3 Demo (1990)|date=1990|publisher=[[John Romero]]|url=https://vimeo.com/148909578|access-date=December 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215031136/https://vimeo.com/148909578|archive-date=December 15, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' demo had not been readily shared, but a working copy was discovered and preserved in the [[Museum of Play]] in July 2021.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/id-softwares-super-mario-bros-3-pc-port-found-in-the-wild/1100-6493889/ | title = Id Software's Super Mario Bros. 3 PC Port Found In The Wild | first = Gabe | last = Gurwin | date = July 13, 2021 | access-date = July 13, 2021 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-date = July 13, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210713200251/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/id-softwares-super-mario-bros-3-pc-port-found-in-the-wild/1100-6493889/ | url-status = live }}</ref>
