'''''Racket Attack''''' is a 1988 professional [[tennis]] [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game. It was released in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Moero!! Pro Tennis'''''|燃えろ!!プロテニス}},<ref name="mobygames"/> which the second game of the ''Moero!!'' sports series. The gameplay takes place in a ¼ [[Bird's-eye view|overhead view]] [[tennis court]] with the score being present at all times and an audience of [[wikt:spectator|spectator]]s being shown in multiple colors (white, pink, and red). The North American version features an endorsement from [[Wilson Sporting Goods]].
The game was released fairly late in the NES life cycle in Europe and the PAL regions, as available sources show, due to the lengthy process of distributing and the fact that Nintendo have still just started to get into the region by the time of the Japanese release of the game.

This game is seen as an overall improvement over the original ''[[Tennis (1984 video game)|Tennis]]'' video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System with a wide selection of player characters and a deep level of gameplay for the late 1980s.<ref name="rvgr"/>

There are two gameplay modes present: one-player (representing a tennis tournament) and two-player (which represents an exhibition match). After winning seven matches in single-player mode, the player receives a championship [[trophy]]. These matches become increasingly difficult as the player progresses through them. It is possible to play on a [[Grass court|grass]], [[Clay court|clay]], or [[hard court]]. The players can play a women's match, best-of-3, or men's match, best-of-5.

There are 16 different players; eight male, and eight female. They have their own strengths and weaknesses for experimenting. The male players can only play against other male players while females can only play against other females.<ref name="mobygames"/>

[[Password (video gaming)|Passwords]] allow players to retain their statistics after playing for a while; they also allow access to any level between the second round of the tournament and the end game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vghints.com/cheats/16185/NES/Racket%20Attack.html | title = Passwords for ''Racket Attack'' | publisher = VG Hints | date = | accessdate = 2012-12-05}}</ref> There are six possible tennis moves, including the lob, volley, and slice.<ref name="allgame">{{cite web | url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=102 | title = Intermediate synopsis | publisher = [[allgame]] | date = | accessdate = 2012-08-08}}</ref> While serving, the camera angle becomes slightly more over the player's shoulder. Women's matches are noticeably shorter than men's matches and players contain unusual names like "Gibbco" and "First". Both buttons of the NES controller are used to hit the ball; the "A" button is used mainly for front-court action while the "B" button is primarily reserved for back court moves.<ref name="rvgr">{{cite web | url = http://voices.yahoo.com/retro-video-game-reviews-racket-attack-nes-6853694.html | title = Advanced synopsis | publisher = Yahoo!
