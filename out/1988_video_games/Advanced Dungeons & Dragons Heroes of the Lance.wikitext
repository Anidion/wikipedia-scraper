'''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance''''' is a video game released in 1988 for various [[home computer]] systems and consoles. The game is based on the first ''[[Dragonlance]]'' campaign module for the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], ''[[Dragons of Despair]]'', and the first Dragonlance novel ''[[Dragons of Autumn Twilight]]''. ''Heroes of the Lance'' focuses on the journey of eight heroes through the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth, where they must face the ancient dragon Khisanth and retrieve the relic, the Disks of Mishakal.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Heroes_Of_The_Lance_Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Screenshot from the Amiga version.]]
''Heroes of the Lance'' is a side-scrolling action game.<ref name="IGN"/> Even if it is a faithful representation of a portion of the novel ''[[Dragons of Autumn Twilight]]'', it was a departure from the [[role-playing game]] module ''[[Dragons of Despair]]'' the book itself is based on.

The eight heroes from the ''[[Dragonlance]]'' series are assembled for the quest, but only one is visible on the screen at a time; when the on-screen hero dies, the next in line appears.<ref name="IGN"/> ''Heroes of the Lance'' uses ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game statistics, with character statistics taken exactly from the rule books.<ref name=tresca2010/> Three characters have special abilities (healing magic, wizard magic, and trap removal), but the other five merely act as "lives" for the player as in traditional action-platforming games.

==Plot==
{{No plot|date=September 2015}}

==Characters==
The eight heroes that make up the party are:
* [[Goldmoon]], a princess who brandishes the [[Blue Crystal Staff]], an [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)#Artifacts|artifact]] whose powers she seeks to fully understand.
* [[Sturm Brightblade]], a powerful and solemn knight.
* [[Caramon Majere]], a warrior who makes up for his lack of intelligence with pure strength and fighting prowess. 
* [[Raistlin Majere]], Caramon's twin brother; a sly and brilliant, but frail, [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|mage]].
* [[Tanis Half-Elven]], the 'natural leader' of the heroes, and good with a bow.
* [[Tasslehoff Burrfoot]], a [[Kender (fantasy)|kender]] [[pickpocketing|pickpocket]]. He fights with a [[sling (weapon)|sling]] weapon known as a ''{{not a typo|hoopak}}''.
* [[Riverwind]], Goldmoon's betrothed. He is a noble and wise warrior.
* [[Flint Fireforge]], a grizzled [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarven]] warrior.

==Development==
''Heroes of the Lance'' was based on the original Dragonlance novels written by [[Margaret Weis]] and [[Tracy Hickman]].<ref name=tresca2010>{{citation | first1=Michael J. | last1=Tresca | title=The Evolution of Fantasy Role-Playing Games | publisher=McFarland | year=2010 | isbn=978-0786458950 | page=142 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H8bzqj6S4sC&pg=PA142}}</ref> ''Heroes of the Lance'' was not part of the [[Gold Box]] series; the nickname for these other ''D&D'' titles were "Silver Box" games.<ref name="IGN"/> The NES version was developed by [[Natsume Co., Ltd.|Natsume]].
