'''''Ninja Gaiden''''',{{efn|Stylized as NINJA外伝 on the logo}} released in Japan as {{Nihongo foot|'''''Ninja Ryūkenden'''''|忍者龍剣伝|Ninja Ryūkenden|group=lower-alpha|extra=lit. "Legend of the Ninja Dragon Sword"|lead=yes}} and as '''''Shadow Warriors''''' in Europe, is an [[Action game|action]]-[[platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Tecmo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Its development and release coincided with the [[beat 'em up]] [[Ninja Gaiden (arcade)|arcade version]] of the same name. It was released in December 1988 in Japan, in March 1989 in North America, and in August 1991 in Europe. It has been [[Porting|ported]] to several other platforms, including the [[PC Engine]], the [[Super NES]], and mobile phones.

Set in a [[retro-futuristic]] version of 1988, the story follows a ninja named [[Ryu Hayabusa]] as he journeys to America to avenge his murdered father. There, he learns that a person named "the Jaquio" plans to take control of the world by unleashing an ancient demon through the power contained in two statues. Featuring side-scrolling platform [[gameplay]] similar to ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'', players control Ryu through six "Acts" that comprise 20 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]; they encounter enemies that must be dispatched with Ryu's katana and other secondary weapons.

''Ninja Gaiden'' has an elaborate story told through [[anime]]-like cinematic cutscenes. It received extensive coverage and won several awards from video gaming magazines, while criticism focused on its high difficulty, particularly in the later levels. Director [[Hideo Yoshizawa]] named ''Ninja Gaiden'' as his most commercially successful project. The game continued to receive acclaim from print and online publications, being cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. It was novelized as part of the ''[[Worlds of Power]]'' game adaptations written by [[Seth Godin]] and [[Peter Lerangis]]. The game was followed by ''[[Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos]]'' (1990) and ''[[Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom]]'' (1991). A manga-styled comic book, ''Ninja Gaiden '88'', published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], continued the narrative of the five original games.

==Plot==
''Ninja Gaiden'' features a ninja named [[Ryu Hayabusa]] who seeks revenge for the death of his father and gradually finds himself involved in a sinister plot that threatens the entire world.<ref>[[#instman|Instruction Manual]], p. 3.</ref> The story opens with Ryu's father Ken seemingly killed in a duel by an unknown assailant. After the duel, Ryu finds a letter written by Ken which tells him to find an archeologist named Walter Smith in [[United States|America]].<ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Ken Hayabusa''': (In letter to Ryu) Ryu, I am on my way to a life or death duel. If it is my destiny that I not return, you are to take the Dragon sword of the Hayabusa family and go to America and see the archaeologist, Walter Smith.</ref> Before Ryu can find Walter, he is shot and kidnapped by a mysterious young woman; she hands him a demonic-looking statue before releasing him.<ref name="NPreview" /> Ryu then finds Walter who tells him of the demon statues he and Ken had found in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] ruins. Walter tells Ryu of an evil demon named Jashin, that "SHINOBI" defeated, whose power was confined into "Light" and "Shadow" demon statues.<ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Walter Smith''': The demon came to this earth and caused many deaths. But then SHINOBI appeared to stop the demon.</ref><ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Walter Smith''': So SHINOBI confined the evil power of the demon in two statues of 'LIGHT' and 'SHADOW'.&nbsp;... and the body of the demon was confined in a temple.</ref> Ryu shows Walter the "Shadow" demon statue given to him by the woman, but during their conversation, a masked figure, named Basaquer,<ref name = "Manualpp1316"/> suddenly breaks into the cabin and steals the Shadow statue. Ryu gives chase, defeats the masked figure, and retrieves the statue; but when he returns he finds that Walter is dying, and the Light statue is missing. Right after Walter dies, three armed men confront Ryu and tell him to come with them.<ref name="NPreview" />

Ryu is taken to an interrogation room, where he meets Foster, head of the Special Auxiliary Unit of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Foster tells him about a more-than-2000-year-old temple Walter discovered in the Amazon. He explains that Walter mysteriously sealed the ruins, and nobody has since ventured near them.<ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Foster''': In the upper reaches of the Amazon, some ancient ruins were discovered. It seems the temple was built more than 2000 years ago. The discoverer was Dr. Smith, who studied the ruins for some time. But one day, he suddenly sealed off the ruins. And ever since then no one has gone close.</ref> Foster mentions they have been monitoring the activity of someone named Guardia de Mieux, also known as "the Jaquio", who recently moved into the temple where the body of the demon was confined.<ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Foster''': However, a man moved in and took over the ruins. His name is Guardia de mieux. He calls himself the Jaquio.</ref> Using the statues, the Jaquio plans to awaken Jashin and use it to destroy the world.<ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Foster''': If someone brings the demon back to life, he will gain incredible power&nbsp;... enough to control the entire world.</ref> Foster asks Ryu to go to the temple and eliminate him.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barnholt |first=Ray |title=''Ninja Gaiden'' vs. ''Ninja Gaiden'' |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3167971 |website=[[1UP.com]] |date=2008-05-28 |access-date=2008-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106222644/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3167971 |archive-date=2012-11-06 |url-status=dead}}</ref> At the temple, Ryu discovers the Jaquio has captured the girl who handed him the "Shadow" statue earlier. He orders Ryu to give up the demon statue after threatening the girl's life, then drops Ryu through a trapdoor and into a catacomb.<ref name="NPreview2">{{cite magazine |title=''Ninja Gaiden'' |magazine=Nintendo Power |issue=6 |date=May–June 1989 |pages=60–67 |publisher=Nintendo |location=Redmond, WA |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582}}</ref>

After fighting his way back to the top of the temple, Ryu encounters Bloody Malth, whom he defeats. As he is dying, Malth reveals that he was the one who dueled with Ryu's father, that his father is still alive, and Ryu will meet him as he presses onward.<ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Bloody Malth''': Killed? It is true that we fought. But your father is alive.&nbsp;... No, it is not a lie. If you proceed further, you will see him. But it will be the last thing you see.</ref> When he reaches the temple's inner chambers, he discovers his father was possessed by an evil figure.<ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Masked Devil''': Your father was not killed. He was just turned into the Masked Devil.</ref> He destroys the evil figure and releases Ken from its hold. An enraged Jaquio shows himself and tries to kill Ryu with a fiery projectile, but Ken throws himself in front of Ryu and takes the hit. Ryu subsequently kills Jaquio, but then a [[lunar eclipse]] causes the demon statues to transform into Jashin.<ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Ryu''': Is it a lunar eclipse?! That must be it. That's what the 'black moon' meant&nbsp;...</ref> After Ryu defeats the demon, a dying Ken tells Ryu to leave him behind in the temple while it collapses, and to take the young woman with him.<ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Ken''': Ryu, I haven't got much longer&nbsp;... this temple is about to break apart. Take that woman and escape.</ref> Afterwards, Foster, communicating via satellite, orders the girl to kill Ryu and steal the demon statues;<ref>''Ninja Gaiden''. '''Foster''': This is Foster. We detected the explosion from the satellite. Job well done. You are to kill Ryu Hayabusa.&nbsp;... Then you are to steal the demon statues.</ref> she chooses to be with Ryu instead of carrying out the order. The two kiss, and the girl tells Ryu her name, Irene Lew; they watch as the sun rises.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Ninja Gaiden (NES) gameplay.png|256px|thumb|Gameplay in which the player-character [[Ryu Hayabusa]] is about to destroy an enemy bird with his current secondary weapon—a shuriken]]

''Ninja Gaiden'' is a side-scrolling [[platform game]] in which the player takes control of the [[player character|player-character]], [[Ryu Hayabusa]], and guides him through six "Acts" that comprise 20 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].<ref>[[#instman|Instruction Manual]], p. 11.</ref> A [[Health (game mechanic)|life meter]] represents Ryu's physical strength, which decreases when he is hit by an enemy or projectile. A "life" is lost when the life meter is depleted entirely, when Ryu falls off the screen, or when the timer runs out. A [[game over]] screen appears when all lives are lost;<ref name="Indicator">[[#instman|Instruction Manual]], p. 7.</ref> however, the player may restart the level where this occurred by [[continue (video games)|continuing]].<ref>[[#instman|Instruction Manual]], p. 12.</ref> At the end of every Act, the player fights a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]; bosses have life meters depleted by player attacks. When its life meter is depleted entirely, a boss is defeated.<ref name="Indicator" /> Each boss is one of the "Malice Four"—evil underlings of the Jaquio, the game's main antagonist. The Malice Four consist of Barbarian, Bomberhead, Basaquer, and their leader Bloody Malth.<ref name = "Manualpp1316">[[#instman|Instruction Manual]], pp. 13–16.</ref><ref name="MeanMachines">{{cite magazine|last1=Glancey |first1=Paul |last2=Regan |first2=Matt |title=Nintendo review – ''Shadow Warriors'' |magazine=[[Mean Machines]] |issue=10 |date=July 1991 |pages=66–68 |url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/pdf/shadowwarriornes.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180903/http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/pdf/shadowwarriornes.pdf |archive-date=2009-01-05 |issn=0960-4952 |oclc=500020318 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=[[Peterborough]] |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Players attack enemies by thrusting at them with Ryu's Dragon Sword—a [[katana]]-like sword passed down by the Hayabusa clan for generations.<ref name="Manual56">[[#instman|Instruction Manual]], pp. 5–6.</ref> They can also use secondary weapons that consume Ryu's "[[Magic point|spiritual strength]]". These include [[Shuriken|throwing stars]], "windmill throwing stars", which cut through enemies and return like [[boomerang]]s, a series of twirling fireballs named "the art of the fire wheel", and a mid-air slashing technique called the "jump & slash".<ref name="MeanMachines" /><ref name="Manual8">[[#instman|Instruction Manual]], pp. 8–10.</ref> When Ryu's spiritual strength meter is too low, the player cannot use secondary weapons. Players can replenish Ryu's spiritual strength by collecting red and blue "spiritual strength" items found in lamps and lanterns. Other items found along the way include [[hourglass]]es that freeze all enemies and projectiles for five seconds, bonus point containers, potions that restore six units of physical strength, "invincible fire wheels" that make Ryu temporarily invincible to attacks and [[Life (video games)#Extra lives|1-up]]s.<ref name="Manual8" />

Ryu can jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the directional pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. He can also climb a single wall vertically by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.<ref name="NPreview">{{cite magazine |title=''Ninja Gaiden'' |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |issue=5 |date=March–April 1989 |pages=20–30 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |location=[[Redmond, WA]] |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582}}</ref><ref name="Manual56" />

==Development==
[[Tecmo]] first announced the Famicom version of the game in the January 15, 1988, issue of ''Family Computer Magazine'' under the title ''Ninja Gaiden'' (which would later be used for the game's American version).<ref name=famimaga_1988_01_15>{{cite magazine|title=NINJA GAIDEN紹介|magazine=ファミリーコンピュータMagazine [Family Computer Magazine]|date=January 15, 1988|language=ja|url=http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/FC__1988Q1.html#ninjagaiden|access-date=July 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824191430/http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/FC__1988Q1.html#ninjagaiden|archive-date=August 24, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The game was released in Japan on December 9, 1988, under its final title ''Ninja Ryūkenden'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Tecmo |url=http://games.ign.com/objects/025/025071.html |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=2008-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730083333/http://games.ign.com/objects/025/025071.html |archive-date=2010-07-30 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="McLaughlin">{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |title=IGN Presents The History of ''Ninja Gaiden'' |website=IGN |date=2008-01-28 |access-date=2010-05-14 |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/848/848155p1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320040508/http://retro.ign.com/articles/848/848155p1.html |archive-date=2011-03-20 |url-status=dead}}</ref> which roughly translates to ''Legend of the Dragon Sword''.<ref name="Kohler218">[[#PowerUp|Kohler]], p. 218.</ref>{{efn|The Laserdisc for the 1990 ''Ninja Ryūkenden'' [[original video animation|OVA]] features the alternate English title of ''Ninja Ryu: The Dragon Sword Story''.}} It was developed and released around the same time as the [[beat 'em up]] [[Ninja Gaiden (arcade)|arcade version]] of the same name; neither of the games were ports of each other but were parallel projects developed by different teams.<ref name="KatoInterview"/> According to developer [[Masato Kato]] (listed as "Runmaru" in the game's credits), the term "ninja" was gaining popularity in North America, prompting Tecmo to develop a ninja-related game for the NES at the same time the arcade version of ''Ninja Gaiden'' was being developed.<ref name="RG92"/> [[Hideo Yoshizawa]] (listed as "Sakurazaki") developed and directed the NES version.<ref name="RG92" /> ''Ninja Gaiden'' was Masato Kato's first full-time project as a video game designer, and he contributed the game's graphics, animations and instruction manual illustrations.<ref name="KatoInterview" />

Drawing inspiration from the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' series,<ref name="RG92" /> Yoshizawa kept the same title but changed everything else; it became a platform game as opposed to a [[beat 'em up]] such as ''[[Double Dragon]]'';<ref name="McLaughlin" /> the gameplay was modeled after [[Konami]]'s ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'',<ref name="Kohler219-220">[[#PowerUp|Kohler]], pp. 219–220.</ref> with Ryu being equipped with a [[katana]]-like Dragon Sword, [[shuriken]]s, and [[Ninjutsu|ninpo]] techniques such as fire wheels.<ref name="McLaughlin" /> In designing the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja vest to place emphasis on his muscles, and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor to check his surroundings, but that idea was scrapped. According to Kato, they used specific locations and environments to justify the need for having a ninja for a main character.<ref name="RG92" /> A further concern, according to Yoshizawa, was to appeal to the gameplay-oriented expectations of ''Ninja Gaiden''{{'}}s target audience, mainly represented by experienced players who appreciated challenging game design. He recalled that during development, Tecmo adhered to "the philosophy that the user would throw a game away if it wasn't hard enough". As a result, Yoshizawa decided to give the game an overall high level of difficulty.<ref name="NP243">{{cite magazine |title=Power Profiles: Hideo Yoshizawa |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |issue=243 |date=July 2009|pages=76–79 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[New York City]] |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=760783416}}</ref>

Yoshizawa placed greater emphasis on the story, unlike the arcade version,<ref name="RG92" /> and wrote and designed a plot that included over 20 minutes of cinematic [[cutscene]]s—the first time an NES game contained such sequences.<ref name="McLaughlin" /> Yoshizawa stated that the adoption of this presentational style came from his earlier aspiration for a career in commercial filmmaking, which led him to seek an opportunity "to put in a movie somehow".<ref name="NP243"/> His idea was to reverse the then-prevailing trend wherein the narrative aspects of contemporary NES games were undervalued by consumers with the inclusion of an interesting plot that could engage those players.<ref name="NP243"/> Tecmo called the cutscene system "Tecmo Theater" in which the game reveals the storyline between Acts through the use of animated sequences. They are used at the beginning of each Act to introduce new characters such as Irene Lew, Walter Smith, and the Jaquio.<ref name="MeanMachines" /> This feature uses techniques such as close-ups, alternate camera angles, differing background music, and sound effects to make the game more enjoyable for players.<ref name="ManualTheater">[[#instman|Instruction Manual]], p. 4.</ref> Unlike earlier titles such as ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', the cutscenes consisted of large [[anime]] art on the top half of the screen with dialogue on the bottom half. This made the artistic style more reminiscent of [[manga]] titles such as ''[[Lupin&nbsp;III]]'' and ''[[Golgo&nbsp;13]]''. Dimitri Criona, Tecmo USA's director of sales and marketing, said that console games had an advantage over arcade games in that they allowed the creation of a longer game and the inclusion of cutscenes, which Tecmo trademarked as "cinema screens". He noted console games required a different reward structure than arcade games.<ref name="Kohler219-220" /> The game contains a feature that was originally a [[glitch]] but was left in the final game intentionally, according to Masato Kato; having lost to any of the game's last three bosses, the player is sent back to the beginning of the sixth act.<ref name="KatoInterview" />

When the game's text was translated from Japanese to English, the game needed to be reprogrammed to accomplish this; different companies handled this process in different ways. Tecmo's Japanese writers wrote rough translations in English and then faxed them to the American division. According to Criona, the American division would "edit it and put it back together, telling the story in a context that an American English speaker would understand. This would go back and forth several times". Moreover, the game's text was stored in picture files instead of raw computer text. Because of the NES's hardware limitations, the English text needed to be very clear and concise to fall within those limitations; many times, different words with the same meaning but with fewer characters had to be used. All symbols and objects were scrutinized by [[Nintendo of America]], who had specific rules on what could be included for North American releases; for instance, any [[Satanism|Satanic]], [[Christianity|Christian]], or any other religious, sexual, or drug-related references were not allowed.<ref name="Kohler221-222">[[#PowerUp|Kohler]], pp. 221–222.</ref>

==Marketing and release==
Since the game's title was deemed too difficult for English audiences to read, it was renamed when it was released in Western markets.<ref name="McLaughlin" /> In early 1988 advertisements from ''[[Nintendo Fun Club News]]'', Tecmo used ''Ninja Dragon'' as a tentative title for the U.S. release.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tecmo advertisement |magazine=[[Nintendo Fun Club News]] |issue=6 |date=April–May 1988 |page=21}}</ref> They decided to use the title ''Ninja Gaiden'' (its original working title) when the game was released in the U.S. in March 1989.<ref name="NintendoList">{{cite web|url=http://nintendo.com/consumer/gameslist/manuals/nes_games.pdf |title=NES Games |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |access-date=2008-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317023021/http://nintendo.com/doc/nes_games.pdf |archive-date=2007-03-17 |page=9 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The title literally means "Ninja Side-Story", but the game was not intended as a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of any prior work.<ref name="McLaughlin" /> According to an interview with developer [[Masato Kato]], when deciding how to translate "Ryukenden" into English, the staff chose ''Ninja Gaiden'' "because it sounded cool".<ref name="KatoInterview">{{cite web|author=Derboo |title=Interview with Masato Kato |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=2010-05-30 |url=http://hg101.kontek.net/ninjagaiden/ninjagaiden9.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819051328/http://hg101.kontek.net/ninjagaiden/ninjagaiden9.htm |archive-date=2010-08-19 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In Europe, the game was scheduled to be released in September 1990, but was delayed until September 1991.

Upon ''Ninja Gaiden''{{'}}s North American release, Nintendo of America, whose play-testers liked the game and gave it high ratings, decided to help with its marketing. Nintendo's [[house organ]] ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' featured it prominently. According to Criona, it did not take a lot of effort to market the game through the magazine, nor did Tecmo or Nintendo do much else to promote it. ''Ninja Gaiden'' received strong publicity in ''Nintendo Power'' in 1989 and 1990. ''Ninja Gaiden'' received preview coverage in the January–February 1989 issue of ''Nintendo Power'' in its "Pak Watch" section. It "got the highest marks of any title ... [the magazine's staff had] seen in a long time". It was expected to be No. 1 on their "Player's Poll" quickly. The preview compared Ryu's ability to climb and spring off walls to the gameplay in ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=January–February 1989|title=Pak Watch|magazine=Nintendo Power|location=Redmond, WA|publisher=Nintendo|issue=4|page=84|issn=1041-9551|oclc=18893582}}</ref> It was featured on the cover of the magazine's March–April 1989 issue and was referenced in the following issue in a ''[[Howard and Nester]]'' comic strip.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=March–April 1989|title=Ninja Gaiden|magazine=Nintendo Power|location=Redmond, WA|publisher=Nintendo|issue=5|page=front cover|issn=1041-9551|oclc=18893582}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|date=May–June 1989|title=''Howard and Nester''|magazine=Nintendo Power|location=Redmond, WA|publisher=Nintendo|issue=6|pages=54–55|issn=1041-9551|oclc=18893582}}</ref> It was one of the featured games in both March–April and May–June 1989 issues of the magazine; both issues included a walkthrough up to the fifth Act, a review, and a plot overview.<ref name="NPreview" /><ref name="NPreview2" /> Underlining the game's difficulty, it appeared in several issues in the magazine's "Counselor's Corner"<ref>{{cite magazine|date=July–August 1989|title=Counselor's Corner|magazine=Nintendo Power|location=Redmond, WA|publisher=Nintendo|issue=7|page=33|issn=1041-9551|oclc=18893582}}</ref> and "Classified Information" help sections.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=May–June 1989|title=Classified Information|magazine=Nintendo Power|location=Redmond, WA|publisher=Nintendo|issue=6|page=79|issn=1041-9551|oclc=18893582}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|date=September–October 1989|title=Classified Information|magazine=Nintendo Power|location=Redmond, WA|publisher=Nintendo|issue=8|page=72|issn=1041-9551|oclc=18893582}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|date=November–December 1989|title=Classified Information|magazine=Nintendo Power|location=Redmond, WA|publisher=Nintendo|issue=9|page=79|issn=1041-9551|oclc=18893582}}</ref>

The game was unveiled at the 1989 International Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].

Demand for the game eventually exceeded its supply. While Tecmo anticipated the game would be a hit, according to Kohler they did not realize at the time the impact it would have on the video game industry "with its groundbreaking use of cinematics".<ref name="Kohler221-222" /> Yoshizawa would go on to direct the sequel ''[[Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos|Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;II: The Dark Sword of Chaos]]'' (1990) and remained as an executive producer for ''[[Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom|Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;III: The Ancient Ship of Doom]]'' (1991), while Masato Kato took over directing the game design.<ref name="KatoInterview" />

===Ports===
A PC Engine port of ''Ninja Ryūkenden'' was produced in 1992, published by [[Hudson Soft]] and released only in Japan.

''Ninja Gaiden'' appeared as a remake of the ''[[Ninja Gaiden#Ninja Gaiden Trilogy|Ninja Gaiden Trilogy]]'' compilation for the Super NES in 1995. Some reviewers appreciated the redrawn graphics and music in this version, but others found them to be an inadequate effort. ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' reviewers compared it unfavorably to another updated NES remake, ''[[Mega Man: The Wily Wars]]''; they called the version "an exact port-over with no noticeable enhancements in graphics, sound and play control".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=''Ninja Gaiden Trilogy'' Review |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=73 |date=August 1995 |publisher=Sendai Publications |location=[[Lombard, IL]]|issn=1058-918X |oclc=23857173}}</ref> Along with the other two games in the ''Ninja Gaiden'' trilogy, the SNES version was featured as an [[unlockable game]] in the [[Ninja Gaiden (2004 video game)|2004 Xbox Ninja Gaiden]] game.<ref name="RetroGamer">{{cite magazine |title=Retro Revival |magazine=Retro Gamer |issue=3 |date=March 2004 |page=46 |publisher=Imagine Publishing |location=Bournemouth |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015}}</ref>

In July 1990 [[Scholastic Corporation]] published a novelization of ''Ninja Gaiden'' under the ''[[Worlds of Power]]'' series of NES game adaptations, created and packaged by [[Seth Godin]] under the pseudonym F.

Reflecting on his career as a game designer, Yoshizawa considered ''Ninja Gaiden''–along with ''[[Klonoa: Door to Phantomile]]''–his proudest accomplishment, explaining that the title enjoyed the best sales performance out of all of his projects.<ref name="NP243"/> Beyond press coverage by ''Nintendo Power'', the game received strong reviews and publicity from other video gaming magazines upon its release.

The review praised the game's animation in these cutscenes and noted Tecmo's usage of [[close-up]]s and body movements. The reviewer said that while the cutscenes were not fluid, they were effective and entertaining and provided important information about what the player was supposed to do. He appreciated the game had unlimited continues which slightly offset its difficulty, but he criticized it for having over-detailed background graphics especially in the indoor levels, saying that some bottomless pits and items in these levels become slightly camouflaged.<ref name="VGCE">{{cite magazine |last=Wen |first=Howard H. |title=Video Games Reviews – ''Ninja Gaiden'' |magazine=[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]] |issue=10 |date=November 1989 |pages=54, 56 |issn=1059-2938 |oclc=25300986 |publisher=Larry Flynt Publications |location=Beverly Hills, CA |url=https://archive.org/details/video-games-computer-entertainment-issue-10-november-1989/page/n55/mode/2up}}</ref> From July to October 1989, the game was listed at No. 1 on ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'}}s Top Ten Video Games list;<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Electronic Gaming Top Ten |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |issue=2 |date=July–August 1989 |page=82 |publisher=Sendai Publications |location=Lombard, IL|issn=1058-918X |oclc=23857173}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Electronic Gaming Top Ten |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |issue=3 |date=September–October 1989 |page=80 |publisher=Sendai Publications |location=Lombard, IL|issn=1058-918X |oclc=23857173}}</ref> it fell to No. 2 on the list behind ''[[Mega Man 2]]'' in the November issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Electronic Gaming Top Ten |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |issue=4 |date=November 1989 |page=80 |publisher=Sendai Publications |location=Lombard, IL|issn=1058-918X |oclc=23857173}}</ref> In their Best and Worst of 1989, it received awards for Best Game of the Year for the NES and Best Ending in a Video Game for all consoles.

The July 1990 pilot issue of UK magazine ''[[Mean Machines]]'' featured ''Ninja Gaiden'' on the cover; the magazine was distributed as part of the July 1990 issue of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The ''Mean Machines'' Archive – History |magazine=Mean Machines |access-date=2010-04-10 |url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/history.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117140638/http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/history.php |archive-date=2019-11-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In its review, [[Julian Rignall]] compared the game to its [[Ninja Gaiden (arcade)|beat 'em up arcade counterpart]], which was titled ''Shadow Warriors''. He noted the game has great graphics that feature diverse backgrounds and character sprites; he especially praised its use of cartoon-like animation sequences between Acts where the game's plot unfolds. He enjoyed the game's difficulty especially with the bosses, but he noted the game will seem tough at first until players become accustomed to the controls. He criticized the game for its sound, which he said did not fit with the graphics and was "racy" but added "what's there is atmospheric and suits the action". He highly recommended the game to fans of the beat 'em up and combat genres.<ref name="MeanMachines0" />

''Mean Machines'' reviewed the game again (the NES version now officially titled ''Shadow Warriors'' in Europe) in its July 1991 issue. In the review, Matt Regan and Paul Glancey praised its detailed and animated character sprites and its difficulty level. The game's high standards of gameplay, sound, and overall depth impressed Regan; he noted the game's frustrating difficulty but pointed out that it has unlimited continues. Glancey compared the game to the 1990 NES version of ''[[Batman (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Batman]]'' (released later in 1990) with its similar wall-jumping mechanics; he said that its graphics were not as well-developed as ''Batman''{{'}}s but were still satisfactory. He praised its detailed sprites and their animations along with the "Tecmo Theater" concept, noting that the cutscenes "help supply a lot of atmosphere". He said it is one of the best arcade-style games on the NES as well as the best ninja-related game on the system.<ref name="MeanMachines" />

The Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of 28 out of 40.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?a=page_h_title&title_id=000000008261|title=忍者龍剣伝 [ファミコン] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-23}}</ref> The game received some praise and criticism in the August 1991 issue of German magazine ''Power Play''.

===Legacy===
''Ninja Gaiden'' initiated the [[Ninja Gaiden| original ''Ninja Gaiden'' game series]] and was followed by ''[[Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos]]'' (1990), and ''[[Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom]]'' (1991).

In 2004, Tecmo began releasing low-priced [[Episodic video game|episodic installments]] of ''Ninja Gaiden'' for [[AT&T Wireless Services|AT&T]] and [[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]] mobile phones on both [[Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless|BREW]] and [[Java (software platform)|Java]] platforms. The official English Tecmo Games' mobile website advertised it for a future release along with a mobile version of ''[[Tecmo Bowl]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmogames.com/mobile.asp |title=Tecmo 100% Games – Mobile |publisher=[[Tecmo]] |access-date=2006-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903200937/http://www.tecmogames.com/mobile.asp |archive-date=2010-09-03 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The company planned to release the entire game throughout 2004 in a series of four installments—similar to what Upstart Games did when they ported the NES version of ''Castlevania'' to mobile phones.

The mobile phone port of ''Ninja Gaiden'' was met with some praise and criticism. IGN's Levi Buchanan and ''GameSpot''{{'}}s Damon Brown praised the port for its accurate translation from the NES to mobile phones, saying the gameplay, graphics, and cinematic cutscenes remain true to the NES version. They praised the game's controls, despite the omission of the ability to duck so that pressing "down" on the phone's directional pad could be used for secondary weapons; Brown said the port had better controls than most other mobile phone games at the time. They both criticized the port for its lack of sound quality, but Buchanan said this was not Tecmo's fault.<ref name="Brown" /><ref name="Buchanan">{{cite web|last=Buchanan |first=Levi |title=''Ninja Gaiden Episode&nbsp;I: Destiny'' – Wireless Review |website=IGN |date=2004-07-16 |access-date=2010-03-22 |url=http://wireless.ign.com/articles/530/530985p1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518053245/http://wireless.ign.com/articles/530/530985p1.html |archive-date=2011-05-18 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In a preview of the port, ''GameSpot''{{'}}s Avery Score pointed to generally inferior American-made handsets as the reason for the sound's shortcomings.<ref>{{cite web|last=Score |first=Avery |title=''Ninja Gaiden Volume 1: Destiny'' Preview |website=GameSpot |date=2004-01-01 |access-date=2010-03-22 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/mobile/action/ninjagaiden/preview_6094368.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320015815/http://www.gamespot.com/mobile/action/ninjagaiden/preview_6094368.html |archive-date=2005-03-20 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

''[[Retro Gamer]]'' took a look back at ''Ninja Gaiden'' in its March 2004 issue, when the Xbox remake was released. They said the game broke the mold of conventional video game titles by including a plot with cinematic cutscenes added between gameplay segments, adding that the concept of adding cinematics for a game's introduction, plot, and ending was a new concept which "naturally impressed the gaming public". The article noted the game's high level of difficulty, saying the game "threw up an immense challenge even for the veteran gamer, and almost dared you to complete it mentally and physically intact".<ref name="RetroGamer" /> Chris Kohler, in his 2004 book ''Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life'', said, while it was not as far-reaching as ''[[Tecmo Bowl]]'', "it ended up revolutionizing video games with its courageous, unique, and trailblazing use of cinema scenes".<ref name="Kohler219-220" />

Upon its release on the Virtual Console, ''Ninja Gaiden'' was met with high praise, especially for its elaborate story, amount of narrative, and use of [[anime]]-like cinematic sequences.<ref name="1up">{{cite web|title=''Ninja Gaiden'' retro-review |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3120166 |website=1UP.com |date=2000-01-01 |access-date=2008-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106160927/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3120166 |archive-date=2012-11-06 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Some critics have bemoaned its gameplay for being too similar to ''Castlevania''; similarities include identical displays on the top of the screen, items contained in breakable lanterns, and a nearly identical "secondary weapons" feature. A ''[[1UP.com]]'' review noted that the two games have different dynamics and that several actions possible in ''Ninja Gaiden'' would be impossible in ''Castlevania''.<ref name="Casamassina">{{cite web|last=Casamassina |first=Matt |title=17.

''[[Nintendo Power]]'' honored the game in its November 2010 issue, which celebrated the 25th anniversary of the NES. The magazine listed its box art, which depicts a ninja with a burning city in the background, as one of its favorite designs in the NES library.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=25 Years of the NES – The Art of the Game |magazine=Nintendo Power |issue=260 |date=November 2010 |page=64 |publisher=Future US |location=South San Francisco, CA|issn=1041-9551}}</ref> The magazine's Editor-in-Chief Chris Slate was equally impressed by the game's box art. He also reminisced about the game's high level of difficulty with its re-spawning enemies and enemy birds that knocked players into pits, saying this game "may have taught me how to curse". He further praised gameplay features such as clinging on walls and using ninpo techniques, and he noted the game's cinematic cutscenes, including the ominous opening sequence that featured two ninjas who launch into the air at each other clashing their swords in the moonlight. He said that "''Ninja Gaiden'' was about as cool as an 8-bit game could be, especially for ninja-crazed kids of the '80s who, like me, had worn out their [[VHS]] copies of ''[[Enter the Ninja]]''".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Slate |first=Chris |title=25 Years of the NES |magazine=Nintendo Power |issue=260 |date=November 2010 |page=68 |publisher=Future US |location=South San Francisco, CA|issn=1041-9551}}</ref> In a July&nbsp;2011 issue, ''Retro Gamer'' listed the game's opening as one of the most popular at the time. The magazine noted how its use of cutscenes, animations, and overall presentation put the game above most other action titles at the time. While it lauded the controls and gameplay elements, as with other reviews, it criticized the difficulty, calling it "one of the most challenging games on the console". It noted how defeated enemies re-spawn in certain spots, how enemies are placed on the edges of platforms, and the structure of the final level.<ref name="RG92" />
