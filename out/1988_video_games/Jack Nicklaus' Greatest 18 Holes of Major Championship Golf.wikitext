'''''Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf''''' is a [[golf]]-[[simulation video game]] developed by [[Sculptured Software]], and published by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] beginning in 1988. It was released for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Apple IIGS|Apple II{{sc|gs}}]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]] (C64), [[MS-DOS]], [[Macintosh]], [[MSX]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), [[NEC PC-8801|PC-88]], [[Sharp X68000]], and [[Game Boy]].

During 1990 and 1991, the game was released in [[HuCard]] cartridge and CD-ROM formats for the U.S [[TurboGrafx-16]] and its foreign counterpart, [[PC Engine]]. The TurboGrafx-16 versions of the game were titled '''''Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf''''', while the PC Engine version was titled '''''Jack Nicklaus World Golf Tour''''' for the CD-ROM format. The Game Boy version was released as '''''Jack Nicklaus Golf''''' in 1992.

It was the first in [[Jack Nicklaus (series)|a series of golf games]] named after golfer [[Jack Nicklaus]], and was followed by ''[[Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design]]'' (1990).

''[[Amstrad Action]]'' called the CPC version, "Beyond a shadow of a doubt the best golf sim ever on a CPC." However, the magazine also wrote that the game would "only immediately appeal" to golf fans and people who have played computer golf games, while stating, "These limitations will unfairly cripple the game's popularity – a crime, because it's an entertaining and well-programmed sports sim."<ref name=AA/> ''[[CU Amiga-64]]'' praised the Amiga version's gameplay but was critical of the minimal sounds, the putting, and the "agonisingly slow" computer golfer opponent.<ref name=CU/> ''[[Zzap!64]]'' reviewed the Commodore 64 version and criticized the sound effects, as well as the blocky scenery and its unusual color schemes.<ref name=Zap/> ''[[The Games Machine]]'', reviewing the CPC and ST versions, criticized the blocky scenery and its murky colors, as well as simple sound effects and poorly animated golfer [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s.<ref name=TGM-ST/><ref name=TGM-CPC/> Reviewing the Amiga version, the magazine praised the digitized image of Jack Nicklaus that appears in between holes, but criticized the rest of the graphics.<ref name=TGM/>

Tom Malcom of ''[[.info (magazine)|.info]]'' reviewed the Commodore 64 version; he called the graphics adequate and the sound "abominable," and concluded that the game, overall, was a good choice.<ref name=info>{{cite web |last=Malcom |first=Tom |title=Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes |url=https://archive.org/details/info-magazine-26/page/n61 |work=.info |date=May 1989 |accessdate=March 13, 2019 |page=61}}</ref> Malcom subsequently reviewed the Amiga version; he praised the gameplay but felt the graphics were "not what they could, and should, be." He also wished there had been an option to turn off Jack Nicklaus' advice before each hole, stating that it slowed down the gameplay considerably.<ref name=info2>{{cite web |last=Malcom |first=Tom |title=Jack Nicklaus |url=https://archive.org/details/info-magazine-28/page/n37 |work=.info |date=September 1989 |accessdate=March 13, 2019 |page=37}}</ref>

Dan Muse of ''inCider'' praised the Apple II{{sc|gs}} version as "a new standard in computer golf games" and "the best sports game, period."

Mike Siggins reviewed ''Jack Nicklaus Golf – Additional Courses Vol II'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it a rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that "It is good to see Accolade supporting the program with these high quality course disks but their assumption seems to be that there is nothing wrong with the product.
