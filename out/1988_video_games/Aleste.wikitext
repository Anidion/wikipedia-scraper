{{nihongo|'''''Aleste'''''|アレスタ}} is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] developed by [[Compile (publisher)|Compile]], originally published by [[Sega]] in 1988 for the [[Master System]] and then by [[Compile (company)|CP Communications]] for the [[MSX2]]. The Master System version was released outside Japan as '''''Power Strike'''''. The game spawned the ''Aleste'' and ''[[Power Strike]]'' franchises.

==Plot==
The story of ''Aleste'' concerns the manmade supercomputer DIA 51, which has been infected by a hybrid virus that is spreading like wildfire, eventually leading DIA 51 to eliminate the human race. When Yuri, Ray's girlfriend, gets injured in DIA's assault, Raymond Waizen has all the reason in the world to get rid of DIA 51 once and for all in his Aleste fighter.<ref>[http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/nes/manuals/manuals/zanac.txt Zanac USA Manual]</ref>

==Releases==
The game was originally released for the [[Master System]] in February 1988. This version was released outside Japan, as ''Power Strike''. The US release was initially a mail-only limited edition, however it did later see some retail distribution at Toys R' Us and other chains in North America. The European release was a regular retail package.

An [[MSX2]] version was released in July of that year, featuring two new stages, lowered difficulty, and a series of [[cutscene]]s.

A version of the game has been released on phones by [[Square Enix]], presumably based on the MSX2 version. The MSX2 version has been re-released on [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] service in Japan. It along with ''[[Aleste 2]]'' had also been rereleased through [[MSX#Legacy|the now-defunct WOOMB service]].

==Reception==
The Master System version called ''Power Strike'' received positive reviews. ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' scored it 86% in 1989.<ref name="CVG">{{cite journal |title=Complete Games Guide |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref> ''[[Console XS]]'' scored it 90% in 1992.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Software A-Z: Master System |magazine=[[Console XS]] |date=23 April 1992 |issue=1 (June/July 1992) |publisher=[[Paragon Publishing]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=137–47 |url=https://archive.org/details/console-xs-01/page/137}}</ref>
