'''''Fright Night''''' is a video game published by British [[software company]], [[Microdeal]], for the [[Amiga]]. It is based on the American [[Comedy horror|horror comedy]] movie ''[[Fright Night]]''.

==Gameplay==
The game puts the player in control of Jerry Dandridge, who must explore the rooms of a mansion searching for victims to feed on. The objective is to dispose of all the mansion inhabitants whilst avoiding all the crucifixes that are thrown at the player. Once all victims have been deprived of their blood, the next level will become accessible. A coffin can be used as a regeneration spot once the player runs low on health, although it must be reached before dawn, which ultimately results in a Game Over. Blood that is noxious to the player must be avoided, too, as it can bring him to the same fate.

==Reception==
Tom Malcom for ''[[.info (magazine)|Info]]'' said "The humor of ''Fright Night'' is strictly junior-high, but most of us enjoy a little junior-high silliness now and then."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/info-magazine-28/page/n37/mode/2up|title=Info Magazine Issue 28|date=September 28, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Mark Higham for ''[[ST/Amiga Format]]'' said "it's unusual to take on the role of the bad guy, and with the sort of visual treat on offer it's certain to be a hit."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/ST_Amiga_Format_Magazine_Issue_011/page/84/mode/2up|title=ST Amiga Format Magazine Issue 011|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Andy Storer for ''[[New Computer Express]]'' said "Although ''Fright Night'' looks and sounds great, its gameplay – and here you have to remember it's a game about biting into necks and drawing blood – sucks."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/NewComputerExpress023/page/n47/mode/2up|title=New Computer Express 023|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Duncan Evans for ''[[Amiga Computing]]'' said "The graphics are excellent and the SFX are nothing short of brilliant – I love the slurping noise when you bite someone, which restores your health incidentally – but the gameplay is very, very shallow."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/amiga-computing-magazine-014/page/n33/mode/2up|title=Amiga Computing Magazine Issue 014|date=July 28, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Amiga User International]]'' said "the game falls down on a hopeless lack of originality. Overall, this lacklustre variant on a theme deserves to fail, and I can only hope this talented team will consider very carefully before they embark on another turkey."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Amiga_User_International_1989006/page/68/mode/2up|title=Amiga User International 1989006|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
