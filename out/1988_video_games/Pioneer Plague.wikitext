'''''Pioneer Plague''''' is a game designed by  [[Bill Williams (game designer)|Bill Williams]] for the [[Amiga]] computer<ref name="giantlist"/> and published in 1988 by Mandarin Software and Terrific Software. It is one of the few games to use the [[Hold-And-Modify]] display mode of the Amiga for in-game graphics, a mode which allows thousands of colors to be displayed at once, but in a format that's better suited to static images than moving objects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amiga Hold and Modify|url=http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Devices_Manual_guide/node02DC.html|website=AmigaOS 3.5 Developer Docs}}</ref> It may have been the first commercial game to use Hold-And-Modify.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} ''Pioneer Plague'' was not ported to other systems.

Williams also wrote the 1986 Amiga game ''[[Mind Walker]]''.<ref name="giantlist"/>
