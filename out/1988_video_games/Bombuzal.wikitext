'''''Bombuzal''''' is a [[puzzle video game]] designed by [[Antony Crowther]] (credited as "Ratt" in the game) and David Bishop for [[Image Works]].<ref>[http://hol.abime.net/180 Bombuzal] on Hall of the Amiga site</ref> The game was released in 1988 for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Commodore 64]]. It was also released in 1989 for [[MS-DOS]] and Dec, 21 1990 in Japan for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]], with the North American version released on August, 1992 renamed as ''Ka-Blooey''.

The game had a sequel/remake available for the [[Nintendo 64]] called ''[[Charlie Blast's Territory]]''. Among its notable features was the ability to play using either an overhead or [[isometric projection|isometric]] view.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Bombuzal Ingame.png|left|thumb|Teleporter as rescue]]
To complete each of its 130 levels, the avatar has to destroy all bombs on the level. It must stand on top of the bomb to light it, then is only able to take one step away before the bomb explodes; it can also pick up and move bombs, but only the ones that are on Rail tiles. Bombs come in different sizes and it is only possible to ignite the smallest kind without dying. In most cases, the bombs have to be set off using a [[chain reaction]] to prevent the avatar from being killed in the explosion; at other times, separated small bombs can be destroyed one at a time.
Each Bomb/Mine has a reaction zone. For example, a small bomb will only destroy the tile it's on, but will affect any other Bombs/Mines one tile away in the four main directions. A Large bomb will destroy 13 tiles, and its reaction zone will be one tile farther away than the tiles destroyed in each of the four directions, and diagonally between these four points.<ref>Super Nintendo Instruction Booklet page 21.</ref> The game featured level designs by several gaming celebrities, including [[Jon Ritman]], [[Andrew Braybrook]], [[Geoff Crammond]] and [[Jeff Minter]].  Jeff Minter's level blew up to leave behind a llama dropping a pile of dung.

There are also two enemies, Sinister and Dexter, appearing on some levels. These continuously travel along with the level, with Sinister always turning left and Dexter always turning right. Neither Sinister nor Dexter actively pursues the avatar, but contact with either is fatal.
