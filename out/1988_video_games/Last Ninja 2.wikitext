'''''Last Ninja 2: Back with a Vengeance''''' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed and published by [[System 3 (company)|System 3]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]] as a [[sequel]] to the 1987 game ''[[The Last Ninja]]''. The [[Acorn Electron]], [[BBC Micro]], 1990: [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[MS-DOS]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] ports followed in 1989. The NES version of the game was named simply '''''The Last Ninja'''''. In 1990, the '''''Last Ninja Remix''''' edition of the game was re-released for [[8-bit]] systems.

==Gameplay==
The player, controlling a [[ninja]], must fight his way through various levels populated by opponents, collecting necessary items in the process. Each level depicts a different locale and is divided into several screens. The game is presented in an isometric view and the ninja can move in eight different directions and jump.

Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There is a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they will instantly kill or at least severely damage them.

Various items are scattered around the levels, such as keys, a rope and a map; collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game. There are also hamburgers that award an extra life when eaten.

==Plot==
The game continues from the aftermath of the events of ''The Last Ninja''. With the [[Kōga-ryū|Koga]] scrolls now in his possession, Armakuni has begun training a new order of shadow warriors. During a training session, he is mysteriously transported to 20th-century [[New York City]]. Torn from his own time, Armakuni must defeat the evil shogun Kunitoki once more.

==Reception==
''Last Ninja 2'' was an enormous commercial success. According to System 3's Mark Cale, 5.5 million copies were sold for the Commodore 64 version alone; at that time, the user base of the C64 was estimated at 20 million, meaning that one in four C64 owners bought the game.<ref>''Retro Gamer'' 18, page 57.</ref>

It was a runner up for [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]] at the [[Golden Joystick Award]]s. In 2004, readers of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' voted ''Last Ninja 2'' as 68th top retro game.<ref>''Retro Gamer'' 8, page 66.</ref>
