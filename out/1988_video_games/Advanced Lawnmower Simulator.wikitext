'''''Advanced Lawnmower Simulator''''' is a video game for the [[ZX Spectrum]] published as an [[April Fools' Day]] joke by ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' magazine in 1988. The player is tasked with mowing yards with a [[lawn mower]] in exchange for rewards. The magazine claimed the game was developed and published by "Gardensoft" and also published a joke review lauding it and released the game on a cover tape. It was not officially labeled as a prank until August 1990. The concept has inspired other games with similar titles.

The player is presented with a choice of six lawnmowers, five of which are inoperative and cannot be used.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |author1=Luke Reilly |title=5 More Video Games You Won't Believe Somebody Made |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/03/10/5-more-video-games-you-wont-believe-somebody-made |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=3 June 2019 |date=10 March 2013}}</ref> Once the only operative lawnmower has been picked, the player then uses it to mow a lawn.<ref name=IGN /> There is only one key ("M"), and pressing it mows one square of lawn.<ref name="Geek">{{cite web |author1=K.

== Development and release ==
''Advanced Lawnmower Simulator'' was first conceived as a prank in the April 1988 issue of ''[[Your Sinclair]]''.<ref name=Geek /><ref name=YS>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=28|date=April 1988|title=Advanced Lawn Mower Simulation|author=Duncan Macdonald|page=90|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issn=0269-6983}}</ref><ref name=Digitiser /> The piece claimed the player takes on the role of a [[Youth Training Scheme]] junior gardener with a lawnmower, a small toolbox and a can of petrol, and would be able to upgrade their equipment, including additional tools, more cans of petrol and more powerful "grassware". It also claimed that lawns get larger as the game progresses, have hidden traps such as stones, coat-hangers and duck-ponds, and later levels would be rose gardens.<ref name=YS /> The supposed developer and publisher Gardensoft were introduced as "a brand new publishing house that looks set to carve quite a niche for itself in the simulations market",<ref name=YS /> and the piece claimed that they were going to release more games in the coming months, including a spring-cleaning game, a washing-up simulator (including a drying-up simulator) and a laundrette simulator in which players supposedly have to clean bags of various colours and materials.<ref name=YS /><ref name="Digitiser">{{cite web |title=10 MUNDANE JOBS THAT GOT TURNED INTO GAMES |url=https://www.digitiser2000.com/main-page/10-mundane-jobs-that-got-turned-into-games |website=Digitiser |access-date=3 June 2019 |date=8 June 2015}}</ref> It was also stated that ''Advanced Lawnmower Simulator'' is "ACE!" and a "Guaranteed number one!", and would cost Â£14.95.<ref name=YS /> It was also awarded a nine out of ten and given the magazine's MEGAGAME accolade.<ref name=YS /> An advertisement, which described the game as "The most advanced domestic chore simulation yet to hit the home micro!" and claimed a release date of 1st April and that it would be available for purchase in garden centres, appeared in the same issue.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=28|date=April 1988|title=Advanced Lawn-Mowing Simulator|page=102|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issn=0269-6983}}</ref> The game was coded by ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' writer Duncan Macdonald,<ref name=IGN /><ref name=RetroGamer /> and released on a cover tape in the next issue.<ref name=Digitiser /><ref name=Geek /><ref name=IGN /> The game parodied [[Codemasters]]' habit of including the word "simulator" in its game titles.<ref name=DenofGeek /> 

''Your Sinclair'' revealed the review and game to be an April Fools' joke in August 1990 (after a series of letters about the game were supposedly posted to the magazine<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=30|date=June 1988|title=Letters|page=13|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issn=0269-6983}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=31|date=July 1988|title=Letters|page=15|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issn=0269-6983}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=32|date=August 1988|title=Letters|page=13|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issn=0269-6983}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=34|date=October 1988|title=Letters|page=14|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issn=0269-6983}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=47|date=November 1989|title=Letters|page=25|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issn=0269-6983}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=48|date=December 1989|title=Letters|page=21|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issn=0269-6983}}</ref>). The issue also claimed (with screenshots) there are three sequels to the game: one written by Rodney Sproston in which "alien grass has invaded the moon", ''Advanced Lawenmower Simulator III'', in which the player inadvertently enters a nightmare whose only escape from is by mowing through a "dream hole", and ''ALS Part Four - The Revenge Of Mow'', in which the player has to collect money after it falls out of their pocket after purchasing a new mower. The piece finished with the words "Utter crap".<ref name=YS56>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=56|date=August 1990|title=Advanced Lawn Mower Simulator The Trilogy|author=Rodney Sproston|page=49|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issn=0269-6983}}</ref>

== Reception ==
In 2008, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' jokingly stated that ''Advanced Lawnmower Simulator'' "has been hailed as THE best game on the Spectrum", and made jocular judgements on the gameplay and graphics as "Outstanding" and "Excellent" respectively, and of the game as "a truly special experience".<ref name=RetroGamer />

''Advanced Lawnmower Simulator'' appears on an ''[[IGN]]'' list of "Video Games You Won't Believe Somebody Made",<ref name=IGN /> and a ''[[Geek.com]]'' list of "Weirdest Simulation Games of All Time".<ref name=Geek /> ''[[Vice (website)|Vice]]'' described the prank as "one of the strangest incidents in mainstream publishing".<ref name="Vice">{{cite web |author1=Ben Hopkins |title=How 'Your Sinclair' Magazine Changed Video Games Journalism Forever |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/gqm85q/how-a-your-sinclair-magazine-injected-attitude-into-games-journalism-338 |website=[[Vice (website)|Vice]] |access-date=5 June 2019 |date=8 July 2015}}</ref>
