'''''Pool of Radiance''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Strategic Simulations|Strategic Simulations, Inc]] (SSI) in 1988. It was the first adaptation of [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]'s ''[[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (''AD&D'') [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]] for home computers, becoming the first episode in a four-part series of ''D&D'' computer adventure games. The other games in the "[[Gold Box]]" series used the [[game engine]] pioneered in ''Pool of Radiance'', as did later ''D&D'' titles such as the ''[[Neverwinter Nights (1991 video game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'' online game. ''Pool of Radiance'' takes place in the [[Forgotten Realms]] fantasy setting, with the action centered in and around the port city of Phlan.

Just as in traditional ''D&D'' games, the player starts by building a [[Party (role playing games)|party]] of up to six [[Player character|characters]], deciding the race, gender, class, and [[Statistic (role-playing games)|ability scores]] for each. The player's party is enlisted to help the settled part of the city by clearing out the marauding inhabitants that have taken over the surroundings. The characters move on from one area to another, battling bands of enemies as they go and ultimately confronting the powerful leader of the evil forces. During play, the player characters gain [[experience point]]s, which allow them to increase their capabilities. The game primarily uses a first-person perspective, with the screen divided into sections to display pertinent textual information. During combat sequences, the display switches to a top-down "[[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art#Similar projections|video game isometric]]" view.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top 100 RPGs of All Time |url=http://www.ign.com/top/rpgs/46 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915010613/http://www.ign.com/top/rpgs/46 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 15, 2012 |website=IGN |access-date=9 April 2013}}</ref>

Generally well received by the gaming press, ''Pool of Radiance'' won the [[Origins Award]] for "Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988". Some reviewers criticized the game's similarities to other contemporary games and its slowness in places, but praised the game's graphics and its role-playing adventure and combat aspects. Also well-regarded was the ability to export player characters from ''Pool of Radiance'' to subsequent SSI games in the series.

==Gameplay==
''Pool of Radiance'' is based on the same game mechanics as the ''[[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' rule set.<ref name="gmmag">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[G.M. The Independent Fantasy Roleplaying Magazine]] |publisher=Croftward |issue=1 |volume=1 |date=September 1988 |pages=18–20 |title=''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''}}</ref> As in many role-playing games (RPGs), each [[player character]] in ''Pool of Radiance'' has a character race and a [[character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]], determined at the beginning of the game. Six races are offered, including [[elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]] and [[halfling]]s, as well as four classes ([[fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|fighter]], [[cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|cleric]], [[wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|magic-user]], and [[rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|thief]]).<ref name="gmmag" /> Non-human characters have the option to become [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)#Multi-classing|multi-classed]], which means they gain the capabilities of more than one class,<ref name="C+VG" /> but advance in levels more slowly.{{cn|date=April 2023}} During character creation, the computer randomly generates statistics for each character, although the player can alter these attributes.<ref name="AA14" /> The player also chooses each character's [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]], or moral philosophy; while the player controls each character's actions, alignment can affect how NPCs view their actions.<ref name="C+VG" /> The player can then customize the appearance and colors of each character's combat icon.<ref name="gmmag" /> Alternatively, the player can load a pre-generated [[party (role playing games)|party]] to be used for introductory play.<ref name="TGM" /> These characters are combined into a party of six or less, with two slots open for NPCs.<ref name="GameSpotAD&D">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/history_add/p4_02.html |title=GameSpot's History of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons |website=[[GameSpot]] |access-date=5 August 2009}}</ref> Players create their own save-game files, assuring their characters can continue regardless of events in the game. On an [[DOS]] computer, the game can be copied to the hard drive. Other computer systems, such as the [[Commodore 64]], require a separate disk for saved games.<ref name="Dragon143" />

[[File:Pool of radiance panels.png|left|thumb|300px|The game interface. Clockwise from upper left: conversation with a [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragon]]; the party in combat; exploring the graveyard; sample character view.]]
The game's exploration mode uses a three-dimensional first-person perspective, with a rectangle in the top left of the screen displaying the party's current view; the rest of the screen displays text information about the party and the area.<ref name="Gamasutra" /> During gameplay, the player accesses menus to allow characters to use objects; trade items with other characters; parley with enemies; buy, sell, and pool the characters' money; cast [[Magic of Dungeons & Dragons|spells]], and learn new magic skills. Players can view characters' movement from different angles, including an aerial view.<ref name="Zzap" /> The game uses three different versions of each [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] to indicate differences between short-, medium-, and long-range encounters.<ref name="HighScore" />

In combat mode, the screen switches to a top-down perspective with [[Isometric graphics in video games|dimetric projection]], where the player chooses what actions the characters will take in each round; these actions occur immediately, instead of happening after all commands are issued as is standard in some RPGs.<ref name="Gamasutra" /> Optionally, the player can let the computer choose character moves for each round.<ref name="Zzap" /> Characters and monsters may make an extra attack on a retreating enemy that moves next to them.<ref name="Gamasutra" /> If a character's [[hit point]]s (HP) go below zero, they must be bandaged by another character or the wounded character will die.<ref name="Gamasutra" /> The game contains [[random encounter]]s, and game reviewers for ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine observed that random encounters seem to follow standard patterns of encounter tables in pen and paper ''AD&D'' game manuals. They also observed that the depictions of monsters confronting the party "looked as though they had jumped from the pages of the ''Monster Manual''".<ref name="Dragon143" />

Different combat options are available to characters based on class: fighters can use [[melee weapon|melee]] or [[ranged weapon|ranged]] weapons; magic-users can cast spells; thieves are able to "back-stab" an opponent by strategically positioning themselves.<ref name="Gamasutra" /> As fighters progress in level, they can attack more than once in a round, and they also gain the ability to "sweep" enemies, effectively attacking each nearby low-level creature in the same turn.<ref name="GameSpy" /> Magic-users and clerics are allowed to memorize and cast a set number of spells each day. Once cast, a spell must be memorized again before reuse. The process requires hours of inactivity for all characters, during which they rest in a camp; this also restores lost hit points to damaged characters.<ref name="Gamasutra" /> This chore of memorizing spells each night significantly added to the amount of game management required by the player.<ref name=tresca2010>{{citation |first1=Michael J. |last1=Tresca |title=The Evolution of Fantasy Role-Playing Games |publisher=McFarland |year=2010 |isbn=978-0786458950 |page=142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H8bzqj6S4sC&pg=PA142}}</ref>

As characters defeat enemies, they gain [[experience point]]s (XP). After gaining enough XP, the characters "train up a level" to become more powerful.<ref name="gmmag" /> This training is purchased in special areas within the city walls.<ref name="C+VG" /> In addition to training, mages can learn new spells by transcribing them from scrolls found in the unsettled areas.<ref name="Gamasutra" /> Defeated enemies in these areas also contain items such as weapons and armor, which characters can sell to city stores.<ref name="Dragon143" />

===Copy protection===
The DOS, Macintosh and Apple II versions of ''Pool of Radiance'' include a 2-ply [[code wheel]] for translating [[Elvish languages|elvish]] and [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarven]] [[runes]] to English. Some dwarven runes have multiple different translations.<ref name="C+VG" /><ref name=PoRDOS>''Pool of Radiance'' (1988). DOS. Strategic Simulations, Inc. Strategic Simulations, Inc.</ref><ref name=dosmanual>{{cite book |title=Pool of Radiance DOS Manual |url=https://archive.org/details/manual_Pool_of_Radiance/page/n2 |date=1988 |publisher=Strategic Simulations}}</ref><ref name=macmanual>{{cite book |title=Pool of Radiance Macintosh Manual |url=https://archive.org/details/pool_of_radiance/page/n1 |date=1989 |publisher=Strategic Simulations}}</ref> After the title screen, a copy protection screen is displayed consisting of two runes and a line of varying appearance (a dotted line, a dashed line, or a line with alternating dots and dashes) which correspond to markings on the code wheel.<ref name=PoRDOS /> The player is prompted to enter a five or six character code which corresponds to a five or six character word. In the case of a five character word, there is a number at the beginning of the word which is not entered.<ref name=dosmanual /><ref name=macmanual /> Under the lines on the wheel are slots which reveal English letters, the coded English word being determined by lining up the runes, matching the correct line appearance, and then entering the word revealed on the code wheel.<ref name=dosmanual /><ref name=macmanual /> If the player enters an incorrect code three times, the game closes itself.<ref name=PoRDOS /> In the DOS version of ''Pool of Radiance'', the code wheel is also used for some in-game puzzles. For example, in Sokol Keep the player discovers some parchment with elvish runes on it that require use of the code wheel to decipher; this is optional however, but may be used to avoid some combat with undead if the decoded words are said to them.<ref name=PoRDOS /> In the NES version, the elvish words are given to the player deciphered without the use of the code wheel, as the NES release did not include a code wheel.

==Plot==
===Setting===
[[File:Pool of radiance area map.png|right|thumb|Once the party reaches the outer confines of Phlan, they can enter the external environment and move about this map. Phlan is located at the outlet of the river near lower center.]]
''Pool of Radiance'' takes place in the [[Forgotten Realms]] fantasy world, in and around the city of Phlan. This is located on the northern shore of the [[Moonsea]] along the Barren River, between [[Zhentil Keep]] and [[Melvaunt]].<ref name="HighScore" /> The party begins in the civilized section of "New Phlan" that is governed by a council. This portion of the city hosts businesses, including shopkeepers that sell holy items for worshippers at each temple, a jewelry shop, and retailers who provide arms and armor. A party can also contract with the clerk of the city council for various commissions; proclamations posted on the walls within City Hall offer pieces of useful information in the form of coded clues which can be deciphered using the included Adventurer's Journal.<ref name="Dragon143" />

Phlan has three temples, each dedicated to different gods. Each temple can heal wounded, poisoned, or afflicted characters, and can restore deceased characters to life for a high price. The party can also visit the hiring hall and hire an experienced NPC adventurer to accompany the party.<ref name="Dragon143" /> Encounters with NPCs in shops and taverns offer valuable information.<ref name="Dillon" /> Listening to gossip in taverns can be helpful to characters, although some tavern tales are false and lead characters into great danger.<ref name="C+VG" />

===Plot summary===
The ancient trade city of Phlan has fallen into impoverished ruin. Now only a small portion of the city remains inhabited by humans, who are surrounded by evil creatures. To rebuild the city and clean up the Barren River, the city council of New Phlan has decided to recruit adventurers to drive the monsters from the neighboring ruins. Using bards and publications, they spread tales of the riches waiting to be recovered in Phlan, which draws the player's party to these shores by ship.<ref name=nst19890119>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=E |date=January 19, 1989 |title=Enter the pool of radiance |work=The New Straits Times |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZaomAAAAIBAJ&pg=5763,1092940 |access-date=2011-06-24}}</ref><ref name="Dragon133" />

At the start of the game, the adventurers' ship lands in New Phlan, and they receive a brief but informative tour of the civilized area.<ref name="GameSpy"/> They learn that the city is plagued with a history of invasions and wars and has been overtaken by a huge band of humanoids and other creatures. Characters hear rumors that a single controlling element is in charge of these forces.<ref name="Dillon" /> The characters begin a block-by-block quest to rid the ruins of monsters and evil spirits.<ref name="GameSpotAD&D" />

Beyond the ruins of old Phlan, the party enters the slum area—one of two quests available right away to new parties. This quest involves the clearing of the slum block and allows a new party to quickly gain experience. The second quest is to clear out Sokol Keep, located on Thorn Island.<ref name="Dragon143" /> This fortified area is inhabited by the undead, which can only be defeated with silver weapons and magic.<ref name="Dragon143" /> The characters' adventure is later expanded to encompass the outlying areas of the Moonsea region.<ref name="GameSpotAD&D" /> Eventually, the player learns that an evil spirit named Tyranthraxus, who has possessed an ancient dragon, is at the root of Phlan's problems.<ref name="Gamasutra" /> The characters fight Tyranthraxus the Flamed One in a climactic final battle.<ref name="GameSpotAD&D" />

===Development===
''Pool of Radiance'' was the first official game based on the ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' rules.<ref name="gmmag" /> The scenario was created by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] designers [[Jim Ward (game designer)|Jim Ward]], [[David Cook (game designer)|David Cook]], [[Steve Winter]], and [[Mike Breault]], and coded by programmers from [[Strategic Simulations, Inc]]'s Special Projects team.<ref name="Dragon149">{{cite magazine |title=The Envelope, Please! |magazine=Dragon |issue=149 |date=September 1989 |pages=20–21}}</ref> The section of the ''Forgotten Realms'' world in which ''Pool of Radiance'' takes place was intended to be reserved for development solely by SSI.<ref name="Dragon133" /> The game was created on [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]] computers, taking one year with a team of thirty-five people.<ref name="gmmag" /> This game was the first to use the [[game engine]] later used in other SSI D&D games known as the "[[Gold Box]]" series.<ref name="HighScore">{{cite book |last=DeMaria |first=Rusel |author2=Johnny L.

Developers also worked to balance the graphics with gameplay to provide a faithful ''AD&D'' feel, given the restrictions of a home computer. In addition to the core [[Dungeons & Dragons rulebooks|''AD&D'' manuals]], the books ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' and ''[[Monster Manual II]]'' were also used during development.<ref name="gmmag" /> The images of monsters were adapted directly from the ''Monster Manual'' book.<ref name=cover2010>{{cite book |first=Jennifer Grouling |last=Cover |year=2010 |title=The Creation of Narrative in Tabletop Role-Playing Games |page=40 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-4451-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xl7P7GwME3gC&pg=PA40}}</ref> The game was originally programmed by Keith Brors and Brad Myers, and it was developed by [[George MacDonald (game designer)|George MacDonald]].<ref name="MobyGames">{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/pool-of-radiance |title=Pool of Radiance |work=[[MobyGames]] |access-date=15 July 2009}}</ref> The game's graphic arts were by Tom Wahl, Fred Butts, Darla Marasco, and Susan Halbleib.<ref name="MobyGames" />

''Pool of Radiance'' was released in June 1988;<ref name="Dragon133">{{cite magazine |title=The Game Wizards |author=Ward, James M. |magazine=Dragon |issue=133 |date=May 1988 |page=42 |url=https://archive.org/details/dragon-magazine-270/Dragon%20Magazine%20133/page/42/mode/2up | access-date=19 June 2024|author-link=Jim Ward (game designer)}}</ref> it was initially available on the Commodore 64, Apple II series and [[IBM PC compatible]] computers.<ref name="Allgame" /> A version for the [[Atari ST]] was also announced.<ref name="TGM" />  The [[Mac (computer)|Macintosh]] version was released in 1989.<ref name="Allgame" /> The Macintosh version featured a slightly different interface and was intended to work on black-and-white Macs like the [[Mac Plus]] and the [[Macintosh Classic|Mac Classic]]. The screen was tiled into separate windows including the game screen, text console, and compass. Graphics were monochrome and the display window was relatively small compared to other versions. The Macintosh version featured sound, but no music. The game's [[Amiga]] version was released two years later.<ref name="AA14" /> The PC 9800 version {{lang|ja|『'''プール・オブ・レイディアンス'''』}} in Japan was fully translated (like the Japanese Famicom version) and featured full-color graphics. The game was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] under the title ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Pool of Radiance'', released in April 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/nes/rpg/advanceddungeonsdpor/index.html |title=Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Pool of Radiance |work=gamespot UK |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013094240/http://uk.gamespot.com/nes/rpg/advanceddungeonsdpor/index.html |archive-date=2008-10-13}}</ref> The NES version was the only version of the game to feature a complete soundtrack, which was composed by Seiji Toda, as he was signed to the publisher, Pony Canyon's record label at the time.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The same soundtrack can be found on the PC-9801 version.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The Amiga version also features some extra music, while most other ports contain only one song that plays at the title screen.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The original ''Pool of Radiance'' game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, which describes secrets relating to the game and the concepts behind it. The booklet guides players through the character creation process, explaining how to create a party. The game also included the 38-page ''Adventurer's Journal'', which provides the game's background. The booklet features depictions of fliers, maps, and information that characters see in the game.<ref name="C+VG" />

=== Sequels and related works ===
''Pool of Radiance'' was the first in a four-part series of computer ''D&D'' adventures set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The others were released by SSI one year apart: ''[[Curse of the Azure Bonds]]'' (1989), ''[[Secret of the Silver Blades]]'' (1990), and ''[[Pools of Darkness]]'' (1991).<ref name="Gamasutra">{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Barton |date=23 February 2007 |title=The History of Computer Role-Playing Games Part 2: The Golden Age (1985–1993) |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070223b/barton_04.shtml |work=[[Gamasutra]] |access-date=26 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227174428/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070223b/barton_04.shtml <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archive-date=27 February 2009}}</ref> The 1989 game ''[[Hillsfar]]'' was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to ''Pool of Radiance''. ''Hillsfar'' is described instead, by the reviewers from ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'', as "a value-added adventure for those who would like to take a side trip while awaiting the sequel".<ref name="Dragon147">{{cite magazine |title=The Role of Computers |author1=Hartley, Patricia |author2=Kirk Lesser |name-list-style=amp |magazine=Dragon |issue=147 |date=July 1989 |pages=78–79}}</ref> A player can import characters from ''Pool of Radiance'' into ''Hillsfar'', although the characters are "reduced to their basic levels" and do not retain any weapons or [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)|magic items]]. Original ''Hillsfar'' characters cannot be exported to ''Pool of Radiance'', but they can be exported to ''Curse of the Azure Bonds''.<ref name="Dragon147" /> A review for ''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' in ''Computer Gaming World'' noted that "you can transfer your characters from ''Pool of Radiance'' and it's a good idea to do so. It will give you a headstart in the game".<ref name="CGW63">{{cite magazine |title=Curse of The Azure Bonds |author=Scorpia |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=63 |url=http://cgw.vintagegaming.org/galleries/index.php?year=1989&pub=2&id=63 |date=September 1989 |pages=8–9, 46 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723104541/http://cgw.vintagegaming.org/galleries/index.php?year=1989&pub=2&id=63 |archive-date=2011-07-23}}</ref>

[[GameSpot]] declared that ''Pool of Radiance'', with its detailed art, wide variety of quests and treasure, and tactical combat system, and despite the availability of only four character classes and the low character level cap, "ultimately succeeded in its goal of bringing a standardized form of AD&D to the home computer, and laid the foundation for other future gold box AD&D role-playing games".<ref name="GameSpotAD&D" /> Scott Battaglia of [[GameSpy]] said ''Pool of Radiance'' is "what many gamers consider to be the epitome of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' RPGs. These games were so great that people today are using MoSlo in droves to slow down their [[Pentium III]]-1000 MHz enough to play these gems".<ref name="GameSpy">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/por_a.shtm |title=The GameSpy Hall of Fame |author=Battaglia, Scott |work=[[GameSpy]] |access-date=5 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211091618/http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/por_a.shtm |archive-date=11 December 2004}}</ref> In March 2008, [[Dvice.com]] listed ''Pool of Radiance'' among its 13 best electronic versions of ''Dungeons & Dragons''.

The 1988 ''Dungeons & Dragons'' role-playing game [[Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|module]] ''[[Ruins of Adventure]]'' was produced using the same adventure scenario as ''Pool of Radiance'', using the same plot, background, setting, and many of the same characters as the computer game.

SSI sold 264,536 copies of ''Pool of Radiance'' for computers in North America, three times that of ''[[Heroes of the Lance]]'', an AD&D-licensed action game SSI also released that year. It became by far the company's most successful game up to that time; even its [[hint book]] outsold any earlier SSI game.<ref name="maher20160318">{{cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2016/03/opening-the-gold-box-part-3-from-tabletop-to-desktop/ |title=Opening the Gold Box, Part 3: From Tabletop to Desktop |work=The Digital Antiquarian |date=2016-03-18 |access-date=19 March 2016 |author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref> It spawned a series of games, which combined to sell above 800,000 copies worldwide by 1996.<ref name=800k>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961119114425/http://www.ssionline.com/cgi-bin/omixlink?709815180+insider%2Fcorporate%2Fcorporate.html |website=SSI Online |url=http://www.ssionline.com/cgi-bin/omixlink?709815180+insider/corporate/corporate.html |title=SSI Corporate Background |publisher=[[Strategic Simulations, Inc.]] |archive-date=November 19, 1996 |url-status=dead |access-date=November 18, 2021}}</ref>

In ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s preview of ''Pool of Radiance'' in July 1988, the writer noted a "sense of ''deja vu''" in the similarity of the game's screen to previous computer RPGs. For example, the three-dimensional view like a maze in the upper-left window was similar to ''[[Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum|Might & Magic]]'' or ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|Bard's Tale]]'', both released in the mid-1980s. The window that included a listing of characters was featured in 1988's ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]''; and the usage of one active character as a representation of the entire party was part of ''Ultima V''. The reviewer also noted that the design approach for game play was "closer to SSI's own ''[[Wizard's Crown]]'' adventures than to the other games in the genre".<ref name="CGW49">{{cite magazine |title=Reflections on a "Pool of Radiance" |author=Wilson, Johnny L. |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=49 |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=49 |date=July 1988 |pages=20–21}}</ref>

''Pool of Radiance'' received positive reviews. ''[[G.M. The Independent Fantasy Roleplaying Magazine|G.M.]]'' called the game's graphics "good" and praised its role-playing and combat aspects. They felt that "roleplayers will find ''Pools'' is an essential purchase, but people who are solely computer games oriented may hesitate before buying it [...] it will be their loss".<ref name="gmmag" /> Tony Dillon from ''[[Commodore User]]'' gave it a score of 9 out of 10; the only complaint was a slightly slow disk access, but the reviewer was impressed with the game's features, awarding it a ''Commodore User'' superstar and proclaiming it "the best RPG ever to grace the C64, or indeed any other computer".<ref name="Dillon">{{cite magazine |last=Dillon |first=Tony |date=October 1988 |title=Pool of Radiance |magazine=Commodore User |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_805_pages |pages=34–35}}</ref> Issue #84 of the British magazine ''[[Computer and Video Games|Computer + Video Games]]'' rated the game highly, saying that "''Pools'' is a game which no role player or adventurer should be without and people new to role playing should seriously consider buying as an introductory guide".<ref name="C+VG">{{cite magazine |title=Reviews |author=Wayne |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games|Computer + Video Games]] |issue=84 |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_1638_page |date=October 1988 |pages=18–19, 21 |isbn=0-8247-8502-9}}</ref> Another UK publication, ''[[The Games Machine]]'', gave the game an 89% rating. The reviewer noted that the third-person arcade style combat view is a "great improvement" for SSI, as they would "traditionally incorporate simplistic graphics in their role-playing games". The reviewer was critical that ''Pool of Radiance'' was "not original in its presentation" and that the colors were "a little drab", but concluded that the game is "classic ''Dungeons & Dragons'' which SSI have recreated excellently".<ref name="TGM">{{cite magazine |title=Pool Your Resources |magazine=[[The Games Machine]] |issue=12 |date=November 1988 |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_825_pages |page=69}}</ref> A review from ''[[Zzap!64|Zzap]]'' was less positive, giving the game a score of 80%. The reviewer felt that the game required too much "hacking, slicing and chopping" without enough emphasis on puzzle solving. The game was awarded 49% for its puzzle factor.<ref name="Zzap">{{cite magazine |title=Pool of Radiance |url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=044&page=127&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap&check=1 |magazine=[[Zzap!64|Zzap]] |issue=44 |date=December 1988 |page=127 |access-date=21 February 2008}}</ref>

Three reviewers for ''Computer Gaming World'' had conflicting reactions. [[Ken St. Andre]]—designer of the ''[[Tunnels & Trolls]]'' RPG—approved of the game despite his dislike of the ''D&D'' system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded as "take it from a 'rival' designer, ''Pool of Radiance'' has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, opined that over-faithful use of the D&D system left it behind others like ''[[Ultima series|Ultima]]'' and ''[[Wizardry]]''. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences.<ref name="cgw198812">{{cite magazine |title=Mirror Images in a "Pool of Radiance" |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=54 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=December 1988 |access-date=3 November 2013 |author1=St. Andre, Ken |author2=Hines, Tracie Forman |pages=28}}</ref> [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that "patience (possibly of [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]]) [is] required to get through this one".<ref name="scorpia199110">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 |title=C*R*P*G*S / Computer Role-Playing Game Survey |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1991 |access-date=18 November 2013 |author=Scorpia |pages=16}}</ref><ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 |title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1993 |access-date=25 March 2016 |author=Scorpia |pages=34–50}}</ref> Shay Addams from ''[[Compute!]]'' stated that experienced role-playing gamers "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who "love dungeons, dragons, and drama".<ref name="addams198902">{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-02-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_105_1989_Feb#page/n65/mode/2up |title=Pool of Radiance |work=Compute! |date=February 1989 |access-date=10 November 2013 |author=Addams, Shay |pages=62}}</ref> In their March 1989 "The Role of Computers" column in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called "The Lessers") gave ''Pool of Radiance'' a three-page review. The reviewers praised ''Pool of Radiance'' as "the first offering that truly follows AD&D game rules", calling it a "great fantasy role-playing game" that "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD&D game players". The reviewers advised readers to "rush out to your local dealer and buy ''Pool Of Radiance''". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The ''Dragon'' reviewers criticized the "notoriously slow" technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the DOS version was extremely fast, so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] (EGA) graphics mode.<ref name="Dragon143" />

Alex Simmons, Doug Johns, and Andy Mitchell reviewed the [[Amiga]] version of ''Pool of Radiance'' for ''Amiga Action'' magazine in 1990, giving it a 79% overall rating. Mitchell preferred the game ''[[Champions of Krynn]]'', which had been released by the time the Amiga version of ''Pool of Radiance'' became available; he felt that ''Pool of Radiance'' was "more of the same" when compared to ''Champions'', but was less playable and with more limited actions for players. Simmons felt that ''Pool of Radiance'' looked primitive and seemed less polished when compared with ''Champions of Krynn''; he felt that although ''Pool'' was not up to the standard of ''Champions'', he said it was still "a fine little game". Johns, on the other hand, felt that ''Pool of Radiance'' was well worth the wait, considering it very user-friendly despite being less polished than ''Champions of Krynn''.<ref name="AA14">{{cite magazine |title=US Gold/SSI - Pool of Radiance |author=Simmons, Alex |author2=Johns, Doug |author3=Mitchell, Andy |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_87_pages |magazine=[[Amiga Action]] |issue=14 |date=November 1990 |pages=72–73}}</ref>

''Pool of Radiance'' was well received by the gaming press and won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988''.<ref name=origins>{{cite web |url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1988 |title=1988 List of Winners |work=Academy of Adventure Gaming, Arts & Design |publisher=Origins Games Fair |access-date=3 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507063608/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1988 |archive-date=May 7, 2008}}</ref> For the second annual "Beastie Awards" in 1989, ''Dragon''{{'}}s readers voted ''Pool of Radiance'' the most popular fantasy role-playing game of the year, with ''Ultima V'' as the runner-up. The Apple II version was the most popular format, the PC DOS/MS-DOS version came in a close second, and the Commodore 64/128 version got the fewest votes. The primary factor given for votes was the game's faithfulness to the ''AD&D'' system as well as the game's graphics and easy-to-use [[user interface]] to activate commands.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Beastie Knows Best |first1=Hartley |last1=Lesser |first2=Patricia |last2=Lesser |first3=Kirk |last3=Lesser |name-list-style=amp |magazine=Dragon |issue=151 |date=November 1989 |page=36}}</ref> ''Pool of Radiance'' was also selected for the [[RPGA]]-sponsored Gamers' Choice Awards for the Best Computer Game of 1989.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Gamers Have Chosen! |magazine=Dragon |issue=151 |date=November 1989 |page=85}}</ref> In 1990 the game received the fifth-highest number of votes in a survey of ''Computer Gaming World'' readers' "All-Time Favorites".<ref name="cgw199001">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=67 |title=CGW Readers Select All-Time Favorites |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January 1990 |access-date=15 November 2013 |pages=64}}</ref>

Allen Rausch, writing for [[GameSpy]]'s 2004 retrospective "A History of D&D Video Games", concluded that although the game "certainly had its flaws (horrendous load times, interface weirdness, and a low-level cap among others), it was a huge, expansive adventure that laid a good foundation for every Gold Box game that followed".<ref name="rausch04">{{cite web |first=Allen |last=Rausch |date=August 15, 2004 |title=A History of D&D Video Games |work=GameSpy |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538865p2.html |access-date=2009-12-23}}</ref> In 1994, ''[[PC Gamer US]]'' named ''Pool of Radiance'' the 43rd best computer game ever.<ref name=pcgamerustop40>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[PC Gamer US]] |title=Top 40: The Best Games of All Time; The Ten Best Games that Almost Made the Top 40 |date=August 1994 |issue=3 |pages=42}}</ref>
