'''''Master of Monsters''''' is a [[turn-based strategy game]] developed by [[SystemSoft]] for the [[MSX]] and [[NEC]] [[PC8801]]. It was ported to a variety of consoles and PCs including the [[PC Engine CD]], [[NEC PC9801]], and [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]]. While it never had the same success as its SystemSoft stablemate ''[[Daisenryaku]]'', the game garnered a loyal following. Its success in the North American market on the Sega Genesis proved sufficient for a sequel on the [[Sega Saturn]], and an [[anime]] art-style enhanced [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] version titled ''Disciples of Gaia'' with a [[Japanese role-playing game]] feel. ''Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia'' was released in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asciient.com/mompr.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990128140039/http://www.asciient.com/mompr.html|title=ASCII Entertainment Software to Release Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia|website=asciient.com|archivedate=January 28, 1999|date=May 28, 1998|accessdate=April 25, 2022}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
Gameplay engages players by permitting them to summon and move monsters around a board in an effort to capture towers and to eventually defeat the opponents (which are controlled either by other humans or by the computer program). Moves are based on a hexagonal board structure, such that every tile on the board is adjacent to six other tiles. Other notable features were the large variety of monsters, upgrading ("leveling up") of veteran units and control of a "Master" character who, if killed, can end the game for that player.

The focus of the game is strategic, despite the fantasy-type characters that might imply an [[Role-playing game (video games)|RPG]] element.  Other than the existence of the Master character and magic in the game, the gameplay is very similar to System Soft's more hardcore modern warfare strategic wargame series ''[[Daisenryaku]]'', with the exception that some versions of the ''Master of Monsters'' (such as ''Master of Monsters – Final'') series allow equippable items, weapons and armor.

== Comparisons ==
The later ''[[Lords of Chaos (video game)|Lords of Chaos]]'' by [[Julian Gollop]] of [[Mythos Games]] shares many of the same elements of summoning and tactics, along with the earlier title Chaos from 1985. David White, creator of the [[open-source video game|open-source]] [[turn-based strategy]] game ''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]'', cited ''Master of Monsters'' as an inspiration.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wiki.wesnoth.org/WesnothPhilosophy | title=The History of, and Philosophy behind Wesnoth (2003 original) | publisher=Wesnoth.org | accessdate=30 June 2019 | archive-date=28 July 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728154301/http://wiki.wesnoth.org/WesnothPhilosophy | url-status=live}}</ref> ''Master of Monsters'' was also compared to later games such as the [[role-playing video game]] series ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' (which also revolves around commanding monsters) and the [[real-time strategy]] game ''[[StarCraft]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Buchanan |first=Levi |date=17 June 2008 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/17/top-10-renovation-games |title=Top 10 Renovation Games |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=12 August 2016 |archive-date=17 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817162200/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/17/top-10-renovation-games |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Updates ==
System Soft Alpha returned the game to its strategy-based roots, and the two entries in the ''Master of Monsters'' series as originally popularized on the NEC 9801 PC were updated by System Soft Alpha with new graphics and [[gameplay]] features. Two more sequels were made for Japanese Windows. Released on Japanese language Windows-based systems, the remakes include ''マスターオブモンスターズIII Special Edition'', ''マスターオブモンスターズ4 ～光と闇の争覇～'', ''Master of Monsters Value Edition'' (the original game, updated and with expansion packs added in), and ''真・マスターオブモンスターズ Final''. A spin-off of the game targeted towards the younger audience was titled ''Masumon Kids''. A mobile version of the game was released in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ss-alpha.co.jp/products/index.html|title=Vi|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2015|archive-date=12 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212165617/http://www.ss-alpha.co.jp/products/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
