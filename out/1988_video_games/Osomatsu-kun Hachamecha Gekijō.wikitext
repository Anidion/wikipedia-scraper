==Gameplay==

The player controls Osomatsu, leader of the sextuplets, through a total of three stages, armed only with a short-range [[slingshot]]. Each stage has a distinct path the players need to follow in order to proceed, though each stage has a variety of different places to go. Each stage is divided into a number of separate segments, with Osomatsu traversing between them via a variety of ways, such as going through doors, falling down pits, grabbing balloons, or jumping on a golden cloud. In order to fight the boss of each stage, the player has to locate and defeat the stage's miniboss, portrayed by either Chibita or Dekapan, in order to locate and defeat Iyami, who plays the role of the stage's boss. Every time a boss or miniboss is defeated, Osomatsu's maximum health and slingshot range both increase.

The player can enter shops run by Totoko, where they can purchase power-ups using collectible yellow ribbons; the player's inventory is located on the pause screen. The shops also have mini-games, such as a [[slot machine]] and a small path-finding game. The player starts each game with three lives and cannot earn any continues; additional lives are awarded by collecting six 1-Up Cards. Defeating enemies can cause them to randomly drop ribbons, health items, or (on rare occasions) 1-Up Cards.

== Reception ==
{{Video game reviews
| Fam = 23/40

The game was poorly received due to the maze-esque level design, frustrating controls and short length.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mdshock.com/2018/09/16/osomatsu-kun-the-bizarre-story-of-the-mega-drives-most-infamous-game/|title=Osomatu=kun: The Bizarre Story of the Mega Drive's Most Infamous Game|website=MD Shock| date=17 September 2018 |accessdate=January 11, 2022}}</ref> Despite this, the game has obtained a cult following as an infamous [[kusoge]].
