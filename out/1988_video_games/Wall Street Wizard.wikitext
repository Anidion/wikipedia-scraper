John Harrington reviewed ''[[Wall $treet Raider]]'' and ''Wall Street Wizard'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it a rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that "In the end, choosing between the two may come down to that hoary old question of what is preferable: game or simulation. ''Wizard'' puts the emphasis on fun and plays better than ''Raider'' as a solo game, and would therefore better suit the 'seat of the pants' style of player.."<ref name="gi16">{{cite journal | last = Harrington |first = John | title =Stock Watch | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 16 | pages =20â€“21 |date=July 1990}}</ref>

The reviewer from ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' felt that people playing stock market games just for fun would enjoy ''Wall Street Wizard'' thanks to the lively design.<ref name="ASM"/>

The reviewer from German magazine ''ST Computer'' felt that the game did a good job of emulating the market atmosphere, and liked its many options and features, commenting that the graphics were good for a strategy game but bemoaned the lack of sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/st-computer_1989-04|title=ST-Computer 1989-04|date=April 20, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

The reviewer from German magazine ''Joystick'' felt that it was a well done and realistic real time German stock market simulation, and that the comprehensive German manual included with the software package was really helpful.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/joystick-de-1989-05|title=Joystick (Deutsch) 1989-05|date=May 20, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
