'''''Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders''''' is a 1988 [[graphic adventure game]] by [[LucasArts|Lucasfilm Games]]. It was the second game to use the [[SCUMM]] engine, after ''[[Maniac Mansion]]''. The project was led by [[David Fox (game designer)|David Fox]], with Matthew Alan Kane as the co-designer and co-programmer.

Like ''Maniac Mansion'', it was developed for the [[Commodore 64]] and later released in 1988 for that system and [[DOS]].<ref name="Internet Archive" />

==Plot==
The story is set in 1997, nine years after the game's production. The plot follows Zak, a writer for the ''National Inquisitor'', a [[tabloid newspaper]]; Annie Larris, a [[freelancer|freelance]] scientist; and Melissa China and Leslie Bennett, two [[Yale University]] students, in their attempt to prevent the nefarious alien Caponians (who have taken over "The Phone Company", an amalgamation of various [[telecommunication companies]] around the world) from slowly reducing the intelligence of everybody on Earth by emitting a 60&nbsp;Hz "[[Mains hum|hum]]" from their "Mind Bending Machine". The Skolarians, another ancient alien race, have left a defense mechanism hanging around to repulse the Caponians (the "Skolarian Device"), which needs reassembly and start-up, but the parts are spread all over Earth and Mars.

==Development==
''Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders'' was developed and published by [[LucasArts|Lucasfilm Games]]. It was the second game to use the [[SCUMM]] engine, after ''[[Maniac Mansion]]''. Like ''Maniac Mansion'', Zak McKracken was initially developed for the [[Commodore 64]] and ported later to other systems. The project was led by [[David Fox (LucasArts game designer)|David Fox]], with Matthew Alan Kane as the co-designer and co-programmer. Fox consulted with [[New Age]] writer [[David Spangler]] for the game materials. The game was originally meant to be more serious, resembling the [[Indiana Jones]] series, but [[Ron Gilbert]] persuaded David Fox to increase the humorous aspects of the game. The game was consequently heavily inspired by many popular theories about aliens, [[ancient astronauts]], and mysterious civilizations. The many places visited in the game are common hotspots for these ideas, such as the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids of Egypt]] and [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Mexico]], [[Caral|Lima]], [[Stonehenge]], the [[Bermuda Triangle]], and the [[Face on Mars]]. The Skolarians are based on the [[Grey alien|Greys]] alien, while the Caponians (a name derived from "[[Al Capone]]") are primarily based on the [[Men in black|Men in Black]], with their Cadillac-shaped spaceship and [[Elvis]]-themed leader (nicknamed "The King"). The Caponians also have heads shaped like [[Easter island#Statues|Easter Island's Moai statues]].

== Release ==
Zak McKracken was originally released in October 1988,<ref name="Internet Archive">{{cite web |title=LucasArts Entertainment Company – 20th Anniversary |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428061222/http://www.lucasarts.com/20th/history_1.htm |url=http://www.lucasarts.com/20th/history_1.htm |archive-date=April 28, 2006}}</ref> for the C64, self-published by Lucasfilm Games. A port to [[IBM PC]] ([[DOS]]) followed in the same year.<ref name="Internet Archive" /> In 1989, the game was ported to the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]]. A DOS version with [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|enhanced graphics]] was also released.

The Japanese version of the game was released in 1990 under the title ''Zak McKracken'' ({{lang-ja|ザックマックラッケン}} ''Zakkumakkurakken''); for the Japanese [[Fujitsu FM Towns]] computer. Produced by [[Douglas Crockford]], it came on CD-ROM with 256-color graphics and a remastered [[sampled audio]] soundtrack. It is playable in both English and Japanese. When this version is played in Japanese, the sprites' eyes are replaced with [[anime]] eyes. The box art was redrawn for the Japanese market by artist Yuzuki Hikaru (弓月光), otherwise known as Nishimura Tsukasa (西村司).

===Re-release===
In March 2015, Zak McKracken was re-released on the [[digital distribution]] platform [[GOG.com]] after years of commercial non-availability.<ref name="gogrerelease">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewatcher.com/news/2015-19-03-outlaws-zak-mckracken-among-new-line-up-of-classic-lucasarts-games-hitting-gog-com |title=Outlaws, Zak McKracken among new line up of classic Lucasarts games hitting GOG.com |date=March 19, 2015 |first=John Paul |last=Jones |access-date=March 19, 2015 |publisher=gamewatcher.com |quote=''Following on from their agreement with Disney last year to release the Lucasarts back catalogue, digital retailer GOG.com have gone and put five more classic titles from the house that George built on their store.

==Reception==
Discussing ''Zak McKracken''{{'}}s commercial performance, David Fox later wrote, "I think Zak was far more popular in Germany and Europe than in the States. I'm not sure why{{nbsp}}... maybe my humor was more European in nature?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.nikocity.de/claret/Int_Dave.htm |title=Interview mit David Fox |website=home.nikocity.de |access-date=12 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010306150013/http://home.nikocity.de/claret/Int_Dave.htm |archive-date=6 March 2001 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Many reviews, both online<ref name="zak-site.com">{{citation|url=http://www.zak-site.com/random.htm |title=Reviews of Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders |access-date=May 24, 2011 |publisher=the Zak McKracken archive |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717061351/http://www.zak-site.com/random.htm |archive-date=July 17, 2011}}</ref> and in print,<ref name = "Zzap!64">{{citation | date = March 1989 | periodical = [[Zzap!64]] | title = Do Games Come Any Sillier Than This?}}</ref><ref name = "Powerplay">{{citation | date = September 1988 | periodical = Power Play / Happy Computer | title = Zak McKracken | pages = 72–73}}</ref> rate ''Zak McKracken'' as among the best adventure games ever made, but others disagree. [[Charles Ardai]] in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' described ''Zak McKracken'' as a good game, but said that it could have been better. He described the game's central flaw in the game's environments, limited to a relatively small number of screens per location, giving each town a movie-set feel compared to the size and detail of ''Maniac Mansion''.<ref name = "CGW">{{citation | date = October 1988 | last = Ardai | first = Charles | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Big Zak Attack | pages = 8–9}}</ref> ''[[PC Computing]]'' wrote that ''Zak McKracken'' for the PC had a clever story but "grade B animation", concluding that "the result falls short of the magic we expect from George Lucas".<ref name="trivette1988">{{Cite magazine |last=Trivette |first=Donald B. |date=October 1988 |title=Fun! |url=http://archive.org/details/PC_Computing_1988_10 |magazine=PC Computing |type=column |language=english |pages=251–256 |access-date=2023-04-07}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' favorably reviewed ''Zak McKracken'', but wished that Lucasfilm would next produce a game that did not depend on jokes and puzzles to tell its story.<ref name="ferrell198901">{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-01-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_104_1989_Jan#page/n83/mode/2up |title=Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders |work=Compute! |date=January 1989 |access-date=November 10, 2013 |author=Ferrell, Keith |pages=82 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316200847/https://archive.org/stream/1989-01-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_104_1989_Jan |archive-date=March 16, 2014}}</ref> The large number of mazes in the game was also a source of criticism, but David Fox felt it was the best way to maximize the game's size and still have it fit on a single [[Commodore 64]] floppy disk. Other critics complained about the need to enter copy protection codes not once, but multiple times whenever the player flew out of the US.

The game was reviewed in 1989 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' No. 142 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game {{frac|3|1|2|}} out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon142">{{Citation|title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser |last2=Lesser |last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk |journal=Dragon |issue=142 |date=February 1989 |pages=42–51}}</ref>

The game received high scores in general press. It received 90 out of 100 in several reviews, such as of [[Zzap!64|Zzap!]], Power Play, Happy Computer, HonestGamers, Pixel-Heroes.de, [[Jeuxvideo.com]], ST Action, and Quandary magazines.<ref name="MobyGames">{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/zak-mckracken-and-the-alien-mindbenders/mobyrank |title=Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders for Amiga (1988) MobyRank |publisher=[[MobyGames]] |access-date=August 28, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617235450/http://www.mobygames.com/game/zak-mckracken-and-the-alien-mindbenders/mobyrank |archive-date=June 17, 2013}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The title of the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' episode "Zach and the Alien Invaders" pays homage to this game's title. Architect Antonino Cardillo argued about the influences that the game ''Zak McKracken'' had on his work ''House of Dust'' during a lecture held at Cinecittà Studios in the context of the Rome Video Game Lab 2019 festival.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.antoninocardillo.com/en/anthology/of-the-architect/articles/from-zak-mckracken-to-house-of-dust/ |title=From Zak McKracken to House of Dust |work=antoninocardillo.com |date=May 11, 2019 |access-date=May 12, 2024 |author=Cardillo, Antonino}}</ref>

===Fan sequels===
Some ''Zak McKracken'' fans have created and released their own sequels, so called [[fangame]]s, among which:
* ''The New Adventures of Zak McKracken'', released in March 2002 by "LucasFan Games"<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0852671/ Die neuen Abenteuer des Zak McKracken (2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404000648/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0852671/ |date=April 4, 2012}} on [[IMDb]]</ref> and containing graphics from the Japanese FM Towns 256 color version and country-specific backgrounds from various Neo-Geo games. The original release was notorious for containing an adult ending. However, the ending was soon changed when the developers were told that the female characters were based on actual persons. This sequel is very short and fairly limited compared to the two other fan sequels.
* ''[[Zak McKracken: Between Time and Space]]'', released in German in April 2008 and re-released as a director's cut in German, English and French (subtitles) in May 2015 by "Artificial Hair Bros.". The game consists of hand-drawn 2D scenes and sprites and pre-rendered 3D videos. It uses the Visionaire Studio engine that professional developers like [[Daedalic Entertainment|Daedalic]] use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visionaire-studio.net/ |title=Visionaire Studio |access-date=June 27, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627061750/http://www.visionaire-studio.net/ |archive-date=June 27, 2015}}</ref>

Other notable but unreleased fan sequels include:
* ''Zak McKracken and the Alien Rockstars'', which was planned for a final release in 2007 following the release of a demo. After several project restarts and lead changes the project was stopped.<ref>[http://www.zak-site.com/zak2b.htm Zak McKracken and the Alien Rockstars (ZMAR)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317040142/http://zak-site.com/zak2b.htm |date=March 17, 2013}} – ZMAR history on zak-site.com</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070711021842/http://www.zak2project.net/ zak2project.net/] in the webarchive</ref> However, the [[game engine]]'s [[source code]] was released on [[SourceForge]].<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mindbender/ mindbender] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111220522/http://sourceforge.net/projects/mindbender/ |date=November 11, 2013}} [[source code]] on [[SourceForge]]</ref>
* ''Zak McKracken and the Lonely Sea Monster'' was scheduled for July 1, 2007, but has come to a halt. It was supposed to maintain the look of the original.<ref>[http://www.zak-site.com/zak2c.htm Zak McKracken and the Lonely Sea Monster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111234414/http://www.zak-site.com/zak2c.htm |date=November 11, 2013}} on zaksite.com</ref>
