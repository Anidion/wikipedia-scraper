==Reception==
Bill Kunkel reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "words cannot adequately describe the sensations one experiences while playing this game. Though other arcade games have tried to duplicate an illusion of depth, they all comes short of the mark. ''Zaxxon 3-D'' serves up the real thing, in a format familiar to most gamers".<ref name="CGW49">{{cite magazine |last=Kunkel |first=Bill |title=Video Gaming World |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=July 1988 |volume=1 |issue=49 |pages=45}}</ref>
