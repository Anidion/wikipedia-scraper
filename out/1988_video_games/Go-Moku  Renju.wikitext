Steve Nichols reviewed ''Go-Moku & Renju'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it 3 stars out of 5, and stated that "if you have tremendous reserves of patience and are willing to put up with the glitches, it is worth a look."<ref name="gi11">{{cite journal | last = Nichols |first = Steve | title =Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 11 | pages =53 |date=December 1989}}</ref>

''[[The Games Machine]]'' said that the range of possibilities make the game "insanely addictive and enjoyable in many ways more subtle than chess â€” and the computer adversary is useful" but cautioned that the actual board game is more affordable.<ref name="TGM">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-18/page/n65/mode/2up|title=The Games Machine Issue 18}}</ref>

Pat Winstanley for ''[[Atari ST User]]'' found that "While the game is fun to play, easy to learn, but frustratingly difficult to win", he felt that the price was high and would have worked better as a budget game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atarimania.com/atari-magazine-issue-atari-st-user-vol-4-no-03_1128.html|title = Atari ST User (Vol. 4, No. 03) - May - 1989: Atari magazine scans, PDF}}</ref>

John Sweeney for ''[[Page 6]]'' found the game "good fun" with the variable size of the board, concluding that it "will give you many hours of enjoyment".<ref name="Page6">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Page6-52-Oct91/page/56/mode/2up|title = Page6 52 Oct91}}</ref>
