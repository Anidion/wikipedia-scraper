{{nihongo|'''''Cyberball'''''|サイバーボール|Saibābōru}} is a [[video game]] released in arcades in 1988 by [[Atari Games]]. The game is a 7-man [[American football]] using robotic avatars of different speeds, sizes, and skill sets set in the year 2022. Originally released for arcades, ''Cyberball'' was ported to several home consoles and computers.

In 1988, Atari released the original ''Cyberball'' arcade game as a large cabinet with two monitors, each with two sets of controls for one or two players. Players on each side could play against computer opponents or head-to-head on opposing monitors for a maximum of four players. In 1989, Atari Games released a sequel to the original ''Cyberball'' in both the same large dual-monitor cabinet titled '''''Tournament Cyberball 2072''''' as well as a stand-alone two-player cabinet titled '''''Cyberball 2072'''''. The sequel included improved game play, which included refined player movements and many more offensive plays and defensive formations, and changed its setting to 2072. Also shipped in 1989 were several conversion kits to modify existing cabinets to ''Tournament Cyberball 2072'' or the 2-player-only ''Cyberball 2072''.

==Gameplay==

[[Image:Cyberball.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot]]

The game replaces the standard [[Down (football)|downs]] system with an explosive ball that progresses from "cool" to "warm", "hot", and "critical" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to "cool" by crossing the 50 [[American football field#Yard lines|yard line]] or by change of possession, whether through [[touchdown]], [[interception]], or [[fumble]]. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can use the money bonuses they earn while playing to upgrade their robots with faster and more durable units. Players select from run, pass, or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium, or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.

The standard configuration allows single player, two player [[Cooperative video game|cooperative]], two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two people opened up a new dimension of gameplay. [[Artificial intelligence in video games|Computer-controlled]] avatars run offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of ''Cyberball'', leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.

==Arcade sequels==
===Native Atari cabinets===
In 1989, Atari Games released the four-player ''Tournament Cyberball 2072'', as well as the 2-player ''Cyberball 2072'', which included the following changes from the original ''Cyberball'':

*New "Game Breakers" mode
*Added [[Rookie]] mode
*Bugfixes, in particular the [[onside kick]]
*Added 100 additional plays
*Introduced the powerback

===Conversion kits===
Also released in 1989 were several conversion kits. These included:

* Kit to upgrade ''Cyberball'' cabinet to ''Tournament Cyberball 2072''
* Kit to upgrade Nintendo Dual System cabinet to ''Tournament Cyberball 2072''
* Kit to upgrade 2-player [[JAMMA]] cabinets to ''Cyberball 2072''

Note, the conversion kit for the original ''Cyberball'' cabinet required a technician to modify the original game PCB by adding several jumper wires as well as a ROM daughter board. Other conversion kits included a full dedicated game PCB.

==Ports==
''Cyberball'' was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1992 by [[Jaleco]]. [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. Ports were also published for the [[Sega Genesis]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].
