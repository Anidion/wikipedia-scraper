'''''Desert Commander'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''Desert Fox: Tank Strategy'''''|砂漠の狐 戦車戦略|''Sabaku no Kitsune: Sensha Senryaku''||lead=yes}} in Japan.}} is a 1988 [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Kemco]] in Japan and North America for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It is themed after the [[North African Campaign|North African theatre]] of [[World War II]] in the [[1940s]], where players take command of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] led by [[George S. Patton]] and [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] to fight against the [[Axis Powers]] led by [[Erwin Rommel]]. Its gameplay consists of moving units into positions to confront enemies in turn-based encounters determined by multiple factors, replenishing units with resources in order to occupy the enemy headquarters or destroy all enemy forces. The title garnered positive reception from critics; Reviewers praised several aspects such as the presentation, visuals, controls, challenge and balance of strategy and action, though others criticized certain design choices while fan reception proved to be mixed in Japan.

''Desert Commander'' is a World War II-themed turn-based strategy game where players assume command of the Allied Forces led by Generals George S. Patton and Bernard Montgomery across five increasingly difficult scenarios that take place in the 1940s, each one giving a pre-determined set number of units to use, to fight against the Axis Powers led by Erwin Rommel.<ref name="VG&CE5"/><ref name="AtWiki"/><ref name="DF:TSCSB">{{cite book|title=砂漠の狐 戦車戦略 完全攻略テクニックブック|publisher=[[Tokuma Shoten]]|date=April 1, 1988|pages=1–55|language=ja|isbn=978-4886580887}}</ref><ref name="DCNESmanual">''Desert Commander'' instruction booklet (Nintendo Entertainment System, US)</ref><ref name="GP'BGtNG">{{cite magazine|last=Bateman|first=Selby|title=First Looks: Desert Commander|magazine=[[Game Players|Game Player's Buyer's Guide to Nintendo Games]]|volume=2|issue=5|publisher=Signal Research|date=October–November 1989|pages=92–93}}</ref> Available modes of play include the main single-player campaign and a two-player versus mode.<ref name="DCNESmanual"/><ref name="GP'BGtNG"/>

The main gameplay objective is to either occupy the enemy headquarters or destroy all opposing forces on the playfield and the player that does so first wins.<ref name="DF:TSCSB"/><ref name="DCNESmanual"/> Players command their units on a map, using a command window function, and each unit have different mobility range that varies according to their type except aircraft units in addition of possessing different shooting range.<ref name="DCNESmanual"/><ref name="GP'BGtNG"/> Terrain plays an important role during battle sequences, as it can affect the outcome of encounters in terms of terrestrial unit's movility, attack and defense (except for aircraft).<ref name="DF:TSCSB"/><ref name="DCNESmanual"/><ref name="GP'BGtNG"/> Each scenario has no time limit and gives a different set number of units to use, which the players can mix and match between the different types without going over that limit.<ref name="DF:TSCSB"/><ref name="DCNESmanual"/><ref name="GP'BGtNG"/> When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command from the player. On the easiest scenario, both the player and the CPU have the same number of units, while in all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces.<ref name="DCNESmanual"/> Prior to a two-player match, players can also customize the number of units at their disposal.<ref name="DF:TSCSB"/><ref name="DCNESmanual"/><ref name="GP'BGtNG"/>

The player's force consists of nine different types of units and one headquarters unit (which is a unit by itself and also can be used to attack).<ref name="DCNESmanual"/> A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit type. Units cannot be produced, but players can replenish them by landing at the appropriate buildings or be resupplied by a supply truck; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply.<ref name="DF:TSCSB"/><ref name="DCNESmanual"/><ref name="GP'BGtNG"/> Transport units are also available to carry infantry units across the map.<ref name="DCNESmanual"/>

== Synopsis ==
World War II began when the German army of [[Adolf Hitler]] invaded [[Poland]] through the use of the infamous [[blitzkrieg]] technique. By June 1940, [[France]] formally surrendered to Nazi Germany; making Germany the strongest nation in Continental Europe. [[Benito Mussolini]], the dictator of Fascist Italy had signed a military alliance with Germany at the time. He looked at this opportunity to transform the [[Mediterranean Sea]] into an "Italian Lake." Axis forces managed to deliver their invading troops to [[Egypt]] by September 1940. However, the Italian army was instantly defeated by the British counterattackers who had a duty to protect Egypt. Germany was determined to help Italy win their conflict while preparing for their [[Operation Barbarossa|fateful campaign in the Soviet Union]] at the same time.<ref name="AtWiki"/><ref name="DF:TSCSB"/>
