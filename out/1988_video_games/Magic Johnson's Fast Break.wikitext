'''''Magic Johnson's Fast Break''''' (alternatively titled '''''Magic Johnson's Basketball''''') is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[basketball]] [[sports game]] developed by [[Arcadia Systems]] and published in 1988. The game features the name and likeness of [[Los Angeles Lakers]] [[point guard]] [[Magic Johnson|Earvin "Magic" Johnson Jr.]], and was endorsed by [[PepsiCo]].

In 1990 [[Tradewest]] published [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]]' adaptation of the game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). It was one of several celebrity-endorsed sports games published by Tradewest, and was promoted with a [[television advertisement]] campaign. An adaptation to the [[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]] was cancelled.

==Gameplay==
The game features two generic basketball teams.  Most versions of the game have one- and two-player modes. The NES version is one of a handful of NES software titles to support three- and four-player simultaneous play using either the [[NES Satellite]] or [[NES Four Score]] [[Video game accessory|console accessories]]. The [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes allow competition in single games, but there is no tournament play.
