{{nihongo foot|'''''Winning Run'''''|ウィニングラン|U~iningu Ran|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a first-person arcade [[racing simulation]] game developed and published by [[Namco]] in late December 1988 in Japan, before releasing internationally the following year. The player pilots a [[Formula One]] racer, with the objective being to complete each race in first place, all while avoiding opponents and other obstacles, such as flood-hit tunnels, pits and steep chambers. It was the first game to run on the [[Namco System 21]] arcade hardware, capable of 3D shaded polygons.

Development of the game began in 1985, taking three years to complete. Upon release, ''Winning Run'' was a major commercial success in Japan and a fairly moderate success in the West. The game received a favorable critical reception, many complimenting its impressive 3D graphics for the time period, alongside its [[Formula One video games|Formula One racing]] realism. It is considered a milestone in 3D polygonal graphics technology, being able to draw 60,000 individual polygons per second. ''Winning Run'' would go on to receive numerous awards from gaming publications, and be followed up by two arcade sequels; ''Winning Run Suzuka GP'' (1989) and ''Winning Run '91'' (1991). A similar arcade game, ''[[Driver's Eyes]]'', was released in 1990.

===Critical response===
''Winning Run'' received critical acclaim from gaming publications, with critics applauding its realism and 3D graphics, considered revolutionary for its time period. In the March 1989 issue of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', Clare Edgeley and [[Julian Rignall]] gave it a positive review, favorably comparing it to Atari's ''[[Hard Drivin']]'' – they labeled ''Winning Run''{{'}}s graphics as "simply stunning", concluding that it is "easily the best racing game yet seen – it's thoroughly realistic and totally exhilarating".<ref name="CVG"/> ''[[The Games Machine]]'' was also positive in their review, calling it one of the most impressive arcade games of the era, referring it as "an astonishing coin-op". Praise was also given to its sense of realism to Formula One racing.<ref name="tgm">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/thegamesmachine-16/TheGamesMachine_16_Mar_1989#page/n69/mode/2up|title=The Games Machine Magazine Issue 16|website=archive.org|date=March 1989|access-date=21 June 2017}}</ref>

The September 1989 issue of ''[[Commodore User]]'' labelled its gameplay and graphics as "literally breathtaking" – much like ''Computer and Video Games'', it was positively compared to ''Hard Drivin''.<ref name="CommodoreUser"/> ''Advanced Computer Entertainment'' labeled it as superior to ''Hard Drivin{{'}}'', stating it usurps the title's graphics and gameplay, and concluding that it was one of the best racing arcade games in the market.<ref name="ACE"/> The March 1990 issue of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' applauded the game's technical capabilities, but said it was not as enjoyable as Atari's game, stating the lack of a stunt course had "diminished the appeal somewhat".<ref name="YS">{{cite news |title=Your Sinclair's Top of the Slots '89 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/69/398 |date=March 1990 |publisher=Your Sinclair}}</ref>

===Accolades===
At the 1989 [[Gamest|''Gamest'' Awards]] in Japan, ''Winning Run'' received a Special Award, and was nominated for "Best Graphics" but lost to [[Taito]]'s shooter ''[[Darius II (video game)|Darius II]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |script-title=ja:第３回 ゲーメスト大賞 |trans-title=3rd Gamest Awards |magazine=[[Gamest]] |date=December 27, 1989 |volume=41 (February 1990) |url=https://archive.org/details/gamest0041/page/49 |pages=49–79 |language=ja|title=Gamest 0041}} [http://www.netlaputa.ne.jp/~dummy/gamest/magazine/gamest/v041.html alternate url]</ref> ''Computer and Video Games'' listed it as one of the top three best arcade games of 1989.<ref name="CVG98">{{Cite magazine|date=16 December 1989|title=The C+VG Top Arcade Games of 1989|url=https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-098/CVG_098_Jan_1990#page/n7/mode/2up|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=98 (January 1990)|page=9}}</ref> The March 1990 issue of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' listed it as one of the top five best arcade games of 1989.<ref name="YS"/>

==Legacy==
The success of ''Winning Run'' led to two follow-up games. ''Winning Run Suzuka GP'' was released in 1989 exclusively in Japan. As its title suggests, this game is centered around the [[Suzuka Circuit]]. This game instead used a sit-down cabinet as opposed to the one used in the original ''Winning Run'', bearing a resemblance to the ones used for Namco's own ''[[Final Lap]]'' three years prior.<ref>{{cite web |title=Winning Run Suzuka Grand Prix |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10449 |website=Killer List of Video Games |access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> ''Suzuka GP'' became Japan's second highest-grossing dedicated [[1990 in video games|arcade game of 1990]], below ''Super Monaco GP''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Tetris" Has Still Earned More Than "Final Fight" |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=396 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=1 February 1991 |page=22 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19910201p.pdf#page=12}}</ref>

The second, ''Winning Run '91'', was released in 1991, again exclusive to Japan, using the same arcade cabinet the original game had.<ref>{{cite web |title=Winning Run '91 |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10447 |website=Killer List of Video Games |access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> A similar 3D racing game, ''[[Driver's Eyes]]'', was released for Japan in 1990 – using a newly built arcade cabinet, it used a set of three panoramic monitors to give a more open view in the game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Driver's Eyes |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7657 |website=Killer List of Video Games |access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> The soundtrack for the game was released by [[Victor Entertainment]] on July 21, 1989, compiling it with music from ''[[Splatterhouse]]'' and ''[[Metal Hawk]]''.<ref name="NGSM"/>
