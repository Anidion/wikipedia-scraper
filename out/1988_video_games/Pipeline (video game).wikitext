'''''Pipeline''''' is a [[video game]] for the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]], originally published by [[Superior Software]] in 1988. It is an overhead view [[action role-playing game]] set on a mining platform. It was remade for [[Microsoft Windows]] as '''''Pipeline Plus''''' (2004).

==Gameplay==
The game is a fast four-way scrolling [[Action-adventure game|arcade adventure]] with a look similar to previous Superior hits ''[[Repton (video game)|Repton]]'' and ''[[Ravenskull (video game)|Ravenskull]]'', but with a higher [[frame rate]]. It is set on a mining platform above [[Io (moon)|Io]], the sulfur-rich moon of [[Jupiter]].

''Pipeline'' was bundled with graphics and level design programs, allowing players to design their own game scenarios incorporating keys and doors, patrolling guards, explosions, throwable objects, moving walls, puzzles in the style of [[Sokoban]], pipes, teleports and other simple kinds of puzzle logic.

==Development==

The game was written by Ian Holmes and William Reeve of [[Cambridge, Cambridgeshire|Cambridge, England]] and published by the leading BBC Micro game company of the time, [[Superior Software]] of [[Leeds]].

The original game concept, strongly influenced by the earlier game ''[[Ravenskull (video game)|Ravenskull]]'', was of an [[Action role-playing game|action RPG]]. By collecting treasure and completing quests, the player would progress through medieval guilds in a [[fantasy]] setting: the working title was ''GuildMaster''.

A change in direction was suggested by Richard Hanson (managing director and co-founder of Superior Software). Instead of a medieval city, the game took place on a contemporary [[oil platform]] with a red-headed protagonist nicknamed Red O'Hare collecting oil drums and putting out fires (a reference to [[Red Adair]]). This plotline was, however, quickly transplanted to a [[Science fiction|science-fictional]] setting, following the [[Piper Alpha]] disaster in 1988.<ref>"[https://www.idesine.com/products/acorn-a-world-in-pixels Acorn - A World In Pixels]" (2020), Idesine, 8 Admirals Gate, London SE10 8JX. </ref>
 
The name ''Pipeline'' arose from the gameplay element of fast transport to distant parts of the map through topologically interwoven pipes (novel to the BBC Micro at the time, but ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' or ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' were well-known examples for this element).

==Release==
The game was first released in 1988 by [[Superior Software]]/[[Acornsoft]]. It was included on the ''Play It Again Sam 11'' compilation in 1989. It was also re-released in 1991 as part of the [[Superior Software|Superior]]/[[Blue Ribbon (software house)|Blue Ribbon]] budget range. Although the inlay made no mention of the game editing programs, they were included on the cassette.

A new expanded version for [[Microsoft Windows]] titled ''Pipeline Plus'' was released by [[Superior Software|Superior Interactive]] in 2004.

==Reception==
The game was given a maximum score by [[Electron User]] with 10/10 for sound, graphics, playability and value for money (as well as overall) calling it "a masterpiece of brain twisting entertainment".<ref>"Io, Io, It's Off To Work We Go", Jon Revis, Electron User, #5.12, September 1988</ref>
