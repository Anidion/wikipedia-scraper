==Gameplay==
''Sargon 4'' is a game in which 107 classic chess games taken from 1851 to 1980 are available to be replayed.<ref name="CGW63"/>

==Reception==
Roy Wagner reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Sargon 4'' has a long standing reputation, but that alone will not give you everything that's wanted in a program. This is not to say that ''Sargon 4'' is not a good purchase. It is an outstanding chess playing partner, but lacks the features of the competition."<ref name="CGW63">{{cite magazine |last=Wagner |first=Roy |title=Chessmaster 2100 vs. Sargon 4 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September 1989 |issue=63 |pages=20–21 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_63/page/n19/mode/1up }}</ref> [[Atari ST]] magazine ''[[STart]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version and said "Sargon IV may be the best chess game you can run on an ST–but only if you use a Mac emulator like [[Spectre GCR|Magic Sac or Spectre 128]]."<ref name="start">{{cite magazine |last1=Plotkin |first1=David |title=Mac and PC On The ST - Sargon IV and Printer Interface III |journal=[[STart]] |date=April 1989 |volume=3 |issue=9 |page=35-36 |publisher=[[Antic Publishing]] |url=https://archive.org/details/STart-Magazine-Issue-20/page/n35/mode/2up}}</ref>
