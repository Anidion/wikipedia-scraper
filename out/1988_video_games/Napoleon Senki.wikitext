This video game allows the player to re-enact the [[Napoleonic Wars]] using a [[bird's-eye view]].<ref name="uvlist">{{cite web | url = http://www.uvlist.net/game-7583-Napoleon+Senki | title = Perspective/Additional game information | publisher = UV List | date = | accessdate = 2008-10-16}}</ref> Starting with earliest battles against the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to grab territory for the fledgling French Republic during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in the year 1796, Napoleon would guide the French Revolutionary Wars until they ended in 1802.<ref name="atwiki">{{cite web | url = http://www25.atwiki.jp/famicomall/pages/846.html | title = Advanced game overview | publisher = FC no Game Seiha Shimasho | date = 24 August 2008 | accessdate = 2009-05-13 | language=ja}}</ref> All the nations that were a participant in the Napoleonic Wars were included like the [[Russian Empire]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], and the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name="atwiki"/> Napoleon's first in-game battle would located in present-day Italy, making the battle equally important in Italian history as it was in French history. There are also battles in [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] along with various other conquests in Europe.

==Gameplay==
[[File:NapleonSenkiSampleGameShot.jpg|250px|thumb|left|This is a screenshot of a player re-enacting one of Napoleon Bonaparte's earliest campaigns.]]

Before each battle, a summary screen is revealed (stating the situation and the military strength of each of the forces).<ref name="atwiki"/> There is also a simple map of Europe with dots on it so the player always knows the exact location of all the possible battles,<ref name="atwiki"/> but the map information is given out in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref name="uvlist"/> An interesting feature of the time was that the altitude of mountains were accurately depicted in the actual battlefields. The deeper the color was, the higher the altitude of the mountain was. For example, light [[brown]] represents small hills while dark brown either represents gigantic mountains or the large peaks of a mountain.

The object is to win each battle using late 18th and early 19th century [[warfare]] tactics so that [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] has a chance of conquering all of [[Europe]]. [[Infantry]], [[artillery]] ([[Round shot|cannonballs]] give them the ability to blow up walls), and [[cavalry]] must be properly used for victory and a successful re-enactment of [[History of France#Napoleonic France (1799–1815)|France's unique and colorful past]].<ref name="samplebattlevideo">{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZDCG4I3n3U | title = In-game battle video | publisher = [[YouTube]] | date = | accessdate = 2012-01-28}}</ref> Soldiers are divided into three categories: friendly soldiers, potential defects, and enemy soldiers. Friendly soldiers must be given commands of north, south, east, west or halt.<ref name="napoleon"/> When a player confront a group of potential defects, there is no battle and the soldiers in the unit of defects joins the platoon that discovered them. Enemy troops can be fought either automatically or manually (with commands of [[wikt:advance|advance]], [[Withdrawal (military)|retreat]], sideways, or halt can be given to each individual soldier).<ref name="samplebattlevideo"/><ref name="napoleon">{{cite web | url = http://homepage2.nifty.com/100man/napoleon/napoleon.html | title = Simple game overview | publisher = Omoide no Famicom | date = | accessdate = 2009-05-13 | language=ja}}</ref>

Each type of soldier has its own strengths and weaknesses.<ref name="theunits">{{cite web | url = http://page.freett.com/minnanohr/top/nap.htm | title = Unit information | publisher = Freett | date = | accessdate = 2012-02-04 | language=ja}}</ref> For example, the [[cavalry]] are the fastest while the [[Swordsmanship|swordsmen]] are the most powerful and the [[rifleman|riflemen]] have the longest range.<ref name="theunits"/> There is a Japanese language write-up about the history of each unit type, the tactics are used in-game, and a quick [[military parade]] with Napoleon Bonaparte leading his troops into battle.<ref name="theunits"/>
