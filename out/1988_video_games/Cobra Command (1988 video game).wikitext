{{nihongo|'''''Cobra Command'''''|コブラコマンド}} is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] released as an [[arcade video game]] by [[Data East]] in 1988. A port was published for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] later the same year.

==Gameplay==
''Cobra Command'' is a horizontally scrolling shooter in which the player takes control of a heavily armored helicopter through six stages to destroy enemy tanks, cannons, submarines, and gunboats.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Judd|author2=Robbins, Joshua |title=Mastering Nintendo video games|publisher=Hayden Books|date=1989|page=152|isbn=978-0-672-48464-3}}</ref> There are missions to [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Borneo]], [[South China Sea]], [[Thailand|Siam]], and the enemy's headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/cobra-command|title=Cobra Command|publisher=Mobygames|date=1988|accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref>

==Ports==

The NES port of ''Cobra Command'' was released the same year as the arcade game. Unlike the arcade game, the NES version does not scroll automatically, and its gameplay is similar to ''[[Choplifter]]'' as the main goal of each level is to rescue all of the hostages. Also, throughout the game, the player's helicopter can be upgraded by landing in certain areas.

Data East also published a port for [[home computers]] by January 1989.<ref name="Almanac" />

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed the game on their October 15, 1988 issue as being the sixth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=342|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 October 1988|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>

In the United States, the home computer port sold more than 50,000 units by January 1989.<ref name="Almanac" />
