'''''Super Mario Bros. 2''''' is a [[Platformer|platform game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was first released in North America in September 1988 and in the [[PAL region]] in 1989.

After the smash hit ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' in 1985, Nintendo quickly released a minor adaptation of the original with advanced difficulty titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', for its mature market in Japan in 1986. However, [[Nintendo of America]] found this sequel too similar to its predecessor, and its difficulty too frustrating, for the nascent American market. This prompted a second ''Super Mario Bros.'' sequel based on {{nihongo foot|'''''Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic''''',|夢工場ドキドキパニック|Yume Kōjō Doki Doki Panikku|lit. ''Dream Machine: Heartbeat Panic''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} Nintendo's 1987 [[Family Computer Disk System]] game which had been based on a prototype platforming game and released as an [[advergame]] for [[Fuji Television]]'s Yume Kōjō '87 media technology expo. The characters, enemies, and themes in ''Doki Doki Panic'' have the mascots and theme of the festival, and were adapted into the ''Super Mario'' theme to make a second ''Super Mario Bros.'' sequel.

''Super Mario Bros. 2'' was a resounding success, becoming the [[List of best-selling Nintendo Entertainment System video games|fifth-best-selling game on the NES]], and was critically well-received for its design aspects and for differentiating the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. It was re-released in Japan for the Famicom as {{Nihongo foot|'''''Super Mario USA'''''|スーパーマリオUSA|Sūpā Mario USA||group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}}<!-- Placed in the notes per WP:JFN. --> ([[1992 in video games|1992]]), and has been remade twice, first included in the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' ([[1993 in video games|1993]]) collection for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], and as ''[[Super Mario Advance (video game)|Super Mario Advance]]'' ([[2001 in video games|2001]]) for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It is included as part of the [[Virtual Console]] and [[Nintendo Switch Online]] services.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Smb2 comparison.png|left|frame|''Super Mario Bros. 2'' features some enemies and items from ''Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic''. The playable characters can now also lift and throw things to defeat enemies.]]
''Super Mario Bros. 2'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]]. The objective is to navigate the [[Player character|player's character]] through the [[Dream world (plot device)|dream world]] Subcon and defeat the main antagonist Wart.{{sfn|Nintendo of America|1988|pp=3-4}} Before each stage, the player chooses one of four protagonists: [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], and [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]]. All four characters can run, jump, and climb ladders or vines, but each character possesses a unique strength that causes them to be controlled differently. For example, Luigi can jump the highest; Princess Toadstool can float because of her dress; Toad's strength allows him to pick up items quickly; and Mario represents the best balance between jumping and strength. Unlike ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', this game has no [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] functionality and no time limit. The original only scrolls from left to right, but this game can also scroll right to left, and even vertically in some areas. Unlike other ''Mario'' games, the characters cannot defeat enemies by jumping on them but can stand on, pick up, and throw most enemies at each other to defeat them. Other objects that can be thrown at enemies include vegetables pulled from the ground and mushroom blocks.{{sfn|Nintendo of America|1988|pp=13-16}}

The game consists of 20 different [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] across the seven worlds comprising Subcon. Each world has three levels, except World 7, which has two.{{sfn|Nintendo of America|1988|p=6}} Each world has a particular theme that dictates the obstacles and enemies encountered in its levels, such as desert areas with dangerous [[quicksand]] and snowy areas with slippery surfaces. Levels contain multiple sections or rooms that are connected via doors or ladders. Some rooms are accessible by entering certain [[vase|jars]]. Magic potions found in each level are used to temporarily access "Sub-space", a reflected, unscrollable area where the player can collect coins and [[Super Mushroom|Mushrooms]] that increase the character's maximum [[Health (gaming)|health]].  In addition, certain jars, when entered in Sub-space, will [[warp (video games)|warp]] the player to the later worlds, skipping levels altogether. Other items available include cherries, which are collected in order to acquire a [[Star (Mario)|Star]]; and the POW Block, which can be used to destroy all the enemies visible on the screen quickly.{{sfn|Nintendo of America|1988|pp=17–21}} The player must defeat a boss enemy at the end of each of the first six worlds, then defeat Wart himself at the end of World 7 to complete the game.

The player starts ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' with three [[1-Up|lives]], one of which is lost each time the player's character loses all health from enemy or hazard damage or when the character falls off the screen. The player can replenish health by collecting floating hearts that appear upon defeating a certain number of enemies. The player will receive a [[Game Over]] upon losing the last life, though the player may [[Continue (video gaming)|continue]] up to twice in one game.  Extra lives may be obtained by collecting hidden 1-Up Mushrooms or by using the coins collected from Sub-space to play the Bonus Chance [[minigame]] between the levels.{{sfn|Nintendo of America|1988|pp=9–10,19,22}}

== Plot ==
Mario has a dream of a staircase leading to a mysterious door to a mysterious place. A voice identifies the world as the dreamland of Subcon, and asks for Mario's help in defeating the villainous frog named Wart, a tyrant who has cursed Subcon and its people. Mario suddenly awakes and decides to tell Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool, who all report experiencing the same dream. The group goes on a picnic, but discovers a cave with a long staircase. Through a door at the top, they are transported to Subcon, revealing their dreams to have been real. After defeating Wart, the people of Subcon are freed and everyone celebrates. Mario suddenly awakes in his bed, unsure if these events were a dream. He soon goes back to sleep.

== Development ==
=== Background and conception ===
{{Quote box|width=33%|quote=The idea was that you would have people vertically ascending, and you would have items and blocks that you could pile up to go higher, or you could grab your friend that you were playing with and throw them to try and continue to ascend&nbsp;... the vertical-scrolling gimmick wasn't enough to get us interesting gameplay.|source=—[[Kensuke Tanabe]] at [[Game Developers Conference]] 2011, on the gameplay mechanics that were later used for ''Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic'' and ''Super Mario Bros. 2''.<ref name="Secret History of SMB2" />}}

Nintendo originally released a different game called ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' on Japan's [[Family Computer Disk System]] in 1986 (later released as ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'' for [[Super NES]] as part of ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]''). Its engine is an enhanced ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', with the same gameplay and more complex level designs, character features, and weather features. Some of the advanced level content had been culled from ''[[Vs. Super Mario Bros.]]'', a 1986 coin-operated arcade version of the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' for NES.<ref name="Secret History of SMB2" /><ref name="History of SMB at IGN">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/ign-presents-the-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=IGN Presents The History of Super Mario Bros.|last=McLaughlin|first=Rus|website=IGN|date=September 14, 2010|access-date=April 9, 2014|archive-date=November 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109000531/https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/ign-presents-the-history-of-super-mario-bros|page=3|url-status=live}}</ref> All of these factors combined to yield an incremental game design with significantly higher difficulty.

Also that year, the young subsidiary [[Nintendo of America]] was just beginning its launch of the new [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and its flagship game, ''Super Mario Bros.'' This international adaptation of the Famicom platform had been deliberately rebranded in the wake of the American [[video game crash of 1983]], a regional market recession which had not directly affected the mature Japanese market. Nintendo of America did not want the increasingly popular [[Super Mario|''Mario'' series]] to be too difficult to a recovering, transfiguring, and expanding market — nor to be stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' could be eventually converted to the NES's cartridge format, localized, and mass-produced for America. Utilizing its regional autonomy to avoid risking the franchise's popularity in this nascent market, Nintendo of America declined the Japanese sequel's localization to America and instead requested a newer and more player-friendly ''Super Mario Bros.'' sequel for release outside Japan.<ref name="History of SMB at IGN" />

=== ''Doki Doki Panic'' ===
An early prototype with vertical scrolling was developed by [[Kensuke Tanabe]],<ref name="director">{{cite interview |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/interview/2181 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105143103/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/interview/2181 |archive-date=November 5, 2013 | interviewer1=Jonathan Metts |interviewer2=Daniel Bloodworth |interviewer3=Matt Cassamassina | first=Kensuke | last=Tanabe | subject-link=Kensuke Tanabe | title=Interview – Kensuke Tanabe Talks Metroid Prime 2: Echoes |date=May 18, 2004 |publisher=Nintendo World Report |access-date=January 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name="gpara">{{cite web |url=http://www.gpara.com/contents/creator/bn_101.htm |title=クリエイターズファイル 第101回 |date=February 10, 2003 |publisher=Gpara.com |access-date=January 11, 2011 |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930045013/http://www.gpara.com/contents/creator/bn_101.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> designed by a team led by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], and programmed by Nintendo's frequent partner, SRD, shortly after Tanabe was hired in April 1986.<ref name="Secret History of SMB2" /> The first prototype's gameplay emphasizes vertically scrolling levels with two-player cooperative action: lifting, carrying, and throwing each other; lifting, carrying, throwing, stacking, and climbing objects; and incrementally scrolling the screen upward when reaching the top. Dissatisfied so far, Miyamoto then added the traditional horizontal scrolling, saying to "make something a little bit more Mario-like",<ref>{{Cite magazine|url = https://www.wired.com/2011/04/super-mario-bros-2/|title = The Secret History of Super Mario Bros. 2|magazine = Wired|last1 = Kohler|first1 = Chris|access-date = July 2, 2021|archive-date = December 28, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228000622/https://www.wired.com/2011/04/super-mario-bros-2/|url-status = live}}</ref> and saying "Maybe we need to change this up ... As long as it's fun, anything goes". However, the prototype software was too complex for Famicom hardware at the time, and the gameplay was still considered lacking, especially in single-player mode.<ref name="Secret History of SMB2" />

Unwilling to compromise on gameplay, Tanabe suspended development of the prototype until eventually receiving instruction to use the Yume Kōjō festival mascots in a game. He recalls, "I remember being pulled over to Fuji Television one day, being handed a sheet with game characters on it and being told, 'I want you to make a game with this'." Tanabe re-implemented that prototype's elements in his new game, and released the [[advergame]]-themed ''Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic'' for the [[Family Computer Disk System]]<ref name="Secret History of SMB2">{{cite magazine | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/04/the-secret-history-of-super-mario-bros-2.ars | title=The Secret History of Super Mario Bros. 2 | date=April 3, 2011 | first=Chris | last=Kohler | via=[[Ars Technica]] | magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | access-date=May 6, 2019 | archive-date=April 5, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405175127/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/04/the-secret-history-of-super-mario-bros-2.ars | url-status=live }}</ref> in Japan on July 10, 1987.<ref>{{cite web |title=夢工場ドキドキパニック |trans-title=Dream Factory Pounding Panic |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/id/M727630 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |access-date=17 June 2021 |archive-date=June 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624200103/https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/id/M727630 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The title {{nihongo foot|''Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic''|夢工場ドキドキパニック|Yume Kōjō Doki Doki Panikku|lit. ''Dream Machine: Heartbeat Panic''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is derived from "doki doki", a Japanese [[onomatopoeia]] for the sound of a quickly beating heart. The title and character concept were inspired by a license cooperation between Nintendo and [[Fuji Television]] to promote the broadcaster's Yume Kōjō '87 event, which showcased several of its latest TV shows and consumer products.<ref name="Secret History of SMB2" /> The Yume Kōjō festival's mascots became the game's protagonists: a family consisting of the boy Imajin, his girlfriend Lina, and his parents Mama and Papa. The rest of the game's characters, including the main villain named Mamu, were created by Nintendo for the project. ''Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic'' takes place within a book with an [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] setting. All four characters are optionally playable, though the game is not fully completed until the player clears all levels using each protagonist.

=== Conversion to ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===
Nintendo of America's [[Gail Tilden]] recalls that president [[Minoru Arakawa]]'s request to convert the thematically unrelated ''Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic'' into a ''Mario'' sequel was "odd" at first but not unusual for Nintendo, which had already converted a canceled ''[[Popeye]]'' prototype into ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and reconceived that into ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]''.<ref name="SMB2 Boss Fight">{{cite book | title=Super Mario Bros. 2 | first1=Jon | last1=Irwin | others=[[Howard Phillips (consultant)|Howard Phillips]], foreword | series=Boss Fight Books | issue=6 | location=Los Angeles | publisher=Boss Fight Books | date=2014 | isbn=978-1-940535-05-0 | oclc=992145732 }}</ref> Summarizing Tanabe's recollections within a 2011 interview, ''Wired'' said "Although the initial concept for the game had been scrapped, the development of that original two-player cooperative prototype inspired all the innovative gameplay of ''Super Mario Bros. 2''".<ref name="Secret History of SMB2" />

For the international conversion into ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', many graphical changes were made to the scenery and characters' look, animation, and identity.<ref name="The strange truth">{{cite web | title=Doki Doki Panic: The strange truth behind Super Mario Bros. 2 | author=Mike | website=Progressive Boink | date=January 24, 2003 | url=http://www.progressiveboink.com/archive/dokidokipanic.html | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622094121/http://www.progressiveboink.com/archive/dokidokipanic.html | archive-date=June 22, 2007 | access-date=February 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name="SMB2 to DDP at TMK">{{cite web | title=From Doki Doki Panic to Super Mario Bros. 2 | publisher=The Mushroom Kingdom | url=http://themushroomkingdom.net/smb2_ddp.shtml | access-date=August 1, 2014 | archive-date=July 25, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725023959/http://themushroomkingdom.net/smb2_ddp.shtml | url-status=live }}</ref> The R&D4 staff modified the character likenesses of Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool, and Toad, building them over their respective counterpart models of Imajin, Mama, Lina, and Papa.

Nintendo has continued to re-release both games, each with the official sequel title of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' in their respective regions.

== Re-releases ==
=== ''Super Mario All-Stars'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario All-Stars}}
In 1993,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/snes/action/supermariocollection/index.html?tag=result;title;0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120702214351/http://www.gamespot.com/snes/action/supermariocollection/index.html?tag=result;title;0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 2, 2012 |title=SNES: Super Mario All-Stars |access-date=August 27, 2008 |website=[[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Nintendo released an enhanced [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] compilation titled ''Super Mario All-Stars''. It includes the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games released for the Famicom/NES. The version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' included in the compilation has modernized graphics and sound to match the Super NES's 16-bit capabilities, as well as minor alterations in some collision mechanics. It is possible to change the character after losing a single life, while the original version allows changing it only after completing a level or when the player loses all their lives and chooses "Continue", making the game more forgiving when choosing a character not adept at some specific level. The player begins with five lives instead of three, and the slot game gains an additional bonus: if the player obtains three sevens, the player wins 10 lives which is something that was not featured in the original NES version of the game. However, the game has a 99-life limit.

=== ''BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge'' ===
In March–April 1996, Nintendo's partnership with the [[St.GIGA]] satellite radio station released an ''[[wikt:裏|ura]]'' or ''[[gaiden]]'' version of the game for the [[Satellaview]] system, titled {{nihongo foot|''BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge''|ＢＳスーパーマリオＵＳＡ パワーチャレンジ|Bī Essu Sūpā Mario USA Pawā Charenji|group=lower-alpha}}. Like all Satellaview games, it was released episodically in a number of weekly volumes,<ref name=kameb>{{cite web|url = http://www.f3.dion.ne.jp/~kameb/satella/st_prg/st_prg.htm|script-title = ja:スーパーファミコンアワー番組表|publisher = The Satellaview History Museum|language = ja|date = February 12, 2008|last = Kameb|access-date = March 29, 2009|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120401183851/http://www.f3.dion.ne.jp/~kameb/satella/st_prg/st_prg.htm|archive-date = April 1, 2012|df = mdy-all}}</ref> only in Japan, and only in this format.<ref name=kameb />

It features 16-bit audiovisual enhancements to the 8-bit original in the fashion of ''Super Mario All-Stars'', plus "[[Satellaview#SoundLink|SoundLink]]" narration ([[radio drama]]-style streaming voice data intended to guide players through the game and give helpful hints and advice) and broadcast CD-quality music. Due to the nature of SoundLink broadcasts, these games were only broadcast to players between 6:00 and 7:00 PM on broadcast dates, at which times players could download the game from the Events Plaza on the [[BS-X|''BS-X'' application cartridge]].<ref name=kameb /> A single rerun of the broadcasts was conducted in the same weekly format from June 3, 1996, to June 29, 1996, at 5:00 to 6:00 PM. The ''BS-X'' download location for the rerun changed to Bagupotamia Temple.<ref name=kameb />

While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, new and arranged content has been added. For instance, the BS version newly featured a score counter. Furthermore, at the beginning of the game, Mario is the only playable character. Later in the game, time-dependent events occur triggering, among other things, the possibility of using other characters. Another feature unique to the game is the inclusion of gold Mario statues (ten in total for each chapter) that are hidden in various locations (including Sub-Space). Collection of the statues in-game grants the player an extra life and refills the life meter. After clearing a level, the player could press "Select" to see some statistics such as the number of statues, coins, cherries, and mushrooms collected, as well as displaying which bosses had been defeated.

As a 4-volume broadcast, each week bore a different subtitle. These are the names of the volumes:

On March 21, 2001, ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' received another release, based on the ''All-Stars'' remake, as part of ''Super Mario Advance'', which also contains a remake of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' ''Super Mario Advance'' was developed by [[Nintendo Research & Development 2]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/mario25th/vol3_page1.jsp |title=Joining Nintendo After Super Mario |date=September 13, 2010 |work=Iwata Asks: Super Mario Bros. 25th Anniversary |publisher=[[Nintendo of America, Inc.]] |access-date=January 19, 2011 |archive-date=February 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217171556/http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/mario25th/vol3_page1.jsp |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was a launch title for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. The ''Super Mario Advance'' version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' includes several new features such as the addition of the enemy Robirdo, a robotic Birdo, replacing Mouser as the boss of World 3; the addition of the ''[[Yoshi]] Challenge'', in which players may revisit stages to search for Yoshi Eggs; and a new point-scoring system, similar to that used in the aforementioned ''BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge''. Graphical and audio enhancements appear in the form of enlarged sprites, multiple hit combos, digital voice acting, and such minor stylistic and aesthetic changes as an altered default health-meter level, boss-order, backgrounds, the size of hearts, Princess Toadstool being renamed to the now-standard "Princess Peach", and the inclusion of a chime to announce Stars.<ref name="gb">{{cite web|last=Nix|first=Marc|date=June 14, 2001|title=Super Mario Bros. 2: Super Mario Advance – Game Boy Advance Review at IGN|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165853p1.html|access-date=February 26, 2010|website=IGN|archive-date=September 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918064330/http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165853p1.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The game was released for the [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] on July 16, 2014, in Japan and later in North America on November 6, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nintendoeverything.com/super-mario-advance-wii-u-virtual-console-footage-japan/ |title=Super Mario Advance Wii U Virtual Console footage (Japan) |publisher=Nintendo Everything |date=July 15, 2014 |access-date=July 16, 2014 |archive-date=August 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821043645/http://nintendoeverything.com/super-mario-advance-wii-u-virtual-console-footage-japan/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It was released for the [[Nintendo Switch]] as a part of the [[Nintendo Switch Online|Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack]] membership plan on May 26, 2023.<ref name="rei">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRyFVwRqUKI|title=Game Boy Advance – May 2023 Game Updates – Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack - YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|language=en|access-date=June 4, 2023}}</ref>

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the Game Boy Advance version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that "This classic probably shouldn't have been brought back.

== Legacy ==
Many elements in ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' have endured in subsequent sequels and in related franchise. The ability to lift and toss enemies and objects—a defining feature of its earliest prototype<ref name="Secret History of SMB2" />—has become part of the permanent repertoire of the ''Super Mario'' franchise, appearing in numerous subsequent ''Super Mario'' games. The [[Wii U]] game ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' features the same playable characters with the same basic physical abilities from ''Super Mario Bros. 2''.<ref name= IGNI /><ref name="StrategyGuide-1">{{cite magazine| title = Mario's Basic Moves| magazine = Nintendo Power: Strategy Guide| publisher = [[Nintendo]]| volume = SG1| year = 1990| issue = 13| page = 4}}</ref><ref name="NP88">{{Cite magazine| date= September 1996| title= Full Coverage&nbsp;— Super Mario 64| magazine= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 88| pages= 14–23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2630&tab=review|title=Super Mario World – Review|last=Miller|first=Skyler|publisher=[[Allgame]]|access-date=July 13, 2009|archive-date=February 16, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216083507/http://allgame.com/game.php?id=2630&tab=review|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Many characters and features of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' have been assimilated into the greater ''Mario'' universe, such as [[Birdo]], Pokey, Bob-omb, and Shy Guy.<ref name= IGNI /> This is the first game in which Princess Toadstool and Toad are playable characters. Princess Toadstool established a floating jump and stars in later ''Mario'' games such as ''[[Super Princess Peach]]''.<ref name= IGNI /> Toad stars in later ''Mario'' games like ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', and ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''. In ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', Luigi became distinguished from Mario's form, especially his tall stature and scuttle jump.<ref name="History of SMB at IGN" /><ref name= IGNI /> The ''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' series gained many direct homages to this game. The 1989 cartoon television show ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' is based on characters, settings, and music from ''Super Mario Bros. 2''.
