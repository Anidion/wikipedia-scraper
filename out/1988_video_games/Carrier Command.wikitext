The game is set in the near future, where a team of [[scientist]]s have developed two robotic aircraft carriers to colonise an [[archipelago]] of sixty four [[island]]s. Unfortunately, the more advanced carrier falls into the hands of a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] organization, and they plan to conquer the archipelago for their own evil ends. It is the player's job to use the less advanced carrier to colonise the islands and destroy the enemy carrier.

==Legacy==
''Carrier Command'' was followed by ''[[Battle Command (video game)|Battle Command]]'', where the player controls a [[tank]].

''[[Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising]]'' (2001) was inspired by ''Carrier Command'' and has many similarities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-hostile-waters|title=Making Of: Hostile Waters|last=Gillen|first=Kieron|date=7 December 2007|website=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]]|publisher=[[Gamer Network]]|access-date=28 April 2022}}</ref>

''[[Carrier Command: Gaea Mission]]'' (2012) is a modern remake by [[Bohemia Interactive|Bohemia Interactive's]] Prague studio. It's a real-time action/strategy game, where the overarching objective is to conquer and control islands. It features a vast 33-island archipelago on the planet-moon Taurus.

''Carrier Command 2'' was announced in December 2020. It was published by the reconstituted [[Microprose]] and was released August 10, 2021 on [[Steam (service)|Steam]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.microprose.com/games/carrier-command-2/|title=Carrier Command 2|website=MicroProse|accessdate=5 April 2023}}</ref> Included in the purchase is a virtual reality version of the game.

The sequel received mixed reviews, with ''[[The Games Machine (Italy)|The Games Machine]]'' rating it 6.7/10 points and calling its gameplay "brilliant" but "brought down by obtuse and ancient systems".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Paschetto |first=Nicolò |date=2021-09-08 |title=Carrier Command 2 – Recensione |url=https://www.thegamesmachine.it/carrier-command-2-pc/carrier-command-2-recensione/ |access-date=2022-06-24 |website=[[The Games Machine]] |language=it-IT}}</ref>
