==Story==
The player characters receive a letter from a dying man who informs them that, during a celebration of your defeat of the evil wizard Mangar, his true master—the Mad God Tarjan—arrived and unleashed foul creatures that destroyed the town of [[Skara Brae]]. The box cover states it thus:
<blockquote>Skara Brae is in ruins. Roscoe's Energy Emporium stands vacant. The Equipment Shoppe went under so quickly Garth was crushed. Your Bard hasn't stopped whimpering since he realized all the taverns were closed.... Someone—or some thing—has sealed the city's fate with an evil so vast, so unspeakable, that a host of Paladins and an army of Archmages are out-matched. Hard times call for subtlety. Smaller is better. Sneakier is better. What the world needs now is a thief. The Thief of Fate.</blockquote>

The game begins in a refugee camp outside the ruined Skara Brae, which replaces the now-destroyed adventurer's guild from the previous games. Besides the city ruins, the wilderness features a temple for healing, a tavern, and a number of special locations from where the party will embark on missions to other worlds over the course of their quest.

Skara Brae was scaled down considerably. The ruins are 16x16 map tiles instead of the city's 30x30 layout from ''The Bard's Tale I'', though its layout remains recognizable. In the ruins of the Review Board, an old man—the sole survivor—directs the party to first kill one Brilhasti ap Tarj, a servant of the mad god Tarjan, in the "Mad God" dungeon below Skara Brae, a startup quest for the characters to attain power, which can be ignored if powerful characters were carried over from previous games. Next, the old man orders the party to retrieve artifacts from several other worlds and also teaches the group the chronomancer spells to be used at certain points in the wilderness to travel to these parallel dimensions and back:
*Arboria (from Twilight Copse): Pleasant elf realm including the city of Ciera Brannia. They have to bring back the hero Valarian or get Valarian's Bow and the Arrows of Life. It turns out Valarian is long since dead and buried in a sacred grove with the items. The king will only allow the party to enter the grove if they first kill the local villain Tslotha Garnath with the Nightspear that can be obtained from Valarian's Tower. In Arboria, the party meets the warrior Hawkslayer for the first time, though he recalls meeting them before (a hint at the fact that the party is travelling not only between dimensions but also across time in their quest).
*Gelidia (from Cold Peak): The party is next tasked to bring Lanatir or, if they cannot convince him to come, Lanatir's Sphere and the Wand of Power back from this dimension of magic. Gelidia turns out to be an icy wasteland with a great ice keep. In a nearby hut, a diary is found with the frozen corpse of a half-elf later identified as Alendar, who is suggested to be dead for a thousand years already. The diary relates how the garrison, lacking a hero like Hawkslayer this time, fared poorly against attackers who killed the god Lanatir. Lanatir was buried in his keep by his remaining followers, who then sealed it with powerful magic. Alendar, the last survivor, finally cast a spell of eternal winter upon the land to vanquish the invaders and then died in the cold himself.
*Lucencia (from Crystal Springs): Shocked at the news of Lanatir's death as much as Valarian's, the old man sends the party to another pleasant world, Lucencia, where the gnome city of Celaria Bree is located. The party has to get the Belt of Alliria and the Crown of Truth. Unsurprisingly, Alliria has been dead for many moons already, and the items have to be retrieved from her tomb. This involves overcoming a dragon, and also Alliria's lover Cyanis, who was driven mad by being forced to watch Tarjan torture Alliria to death.
*Kinestia (from Old Dwarf Mine): In this dwarven realm, the party has to retrieve Ferofist's Helm and the Hammer of Wrath. They arrive in the middle of a great war of the dwarves against robot-themed monsters and meet Hawkslayer again, curiously before they met him in Arboria. Ferofist is found mortally wounded. He asks the party to destroy the fruits of his foolish alliance with the dark one and leaves directions to the heart of the mechanical invasion. There, the party encounters Urmech, an artificial being who himself was created by Ferofist in violation of the God's Pact against further creation (a heinous act that, according to Urmech, helped free the dark one). When confronted, Urmech turns out to be quite reasonable. He points out that he has done no evil except to live, and that he created others of his kind to protect him and so that he will not be all alone. Having found or perhaps created a new kind of magic, Urmech offers to train certain character classes to become Geomancers, a new type of spellcaster. He also surrenders Ferofist's items to the party willingly, if they ask; though there is also the option of fighting him to claim the items.
*Tenebrosia (from Shadow Rock): This world of paradox features a wilderness named "Nowhere" and a town called Black Scar. The party has to bring Sceadu's Cloak and the Helm of Justice back. Having allied with Tarjan, Sceadu will not willingly give away the items and has to be tracked down and slain in combat.
*Tarmitia (from the Vale of Lost Warriors): The "land of unceasing warfare" is a dimension of perpetual war, with the party moving between interwoven battle sites such as Berlin, Rome, Troy, Hiroshima, Wasteland, Stalingrad, and Nottingham until they arrive at Tarmatia, where they have to obtain Werra's Shield and the Strifespear by besting the war god in combat. As mere mortals, they cannot really kill him, but then they are caught up in an attack by another deity immediately afterwards and witness Werra's death. They get the shield, but learn that the Strifespear was given to Hawkslayer.
*Malefia (from Sulphur Springs): Upon returning to the old man, the party finds him mortally wounded. He instructs them to seek out and vanquish Tarjan in his domain, provides the spells required to go there and back (EVIL and LIVE), and reveals the location of the items the party brought back before he dies. From this point onwards, characters cannot level up in Skara Brae, but need to go to a Review Board in one of the Dimensions. With the items retrieved on their previous quests, the party can navigate Malefia, where they find the Strifespear on Hawkslayer's corpse, and finally confront and vanquish Tarjan himself. The canonical strategy (per the cluebook) is for a character of the thief or rogue class to kill Tarjan, by using their special combat ability to sneak up on an opponent from behind, hence the game's subtitle "Thief of Fate".

With Tarjan defeated, it is revealed that the player party took the places of the deities Tarjan killed, becoming a set of new stars in the sky.

==Gameplay==

This [[dungeon crawl]] game featured several improvements over its predecessors:

*An enhanced save game feature
*Two new spellcaster character classes ([[geomancer]] and [[chronomancer]])

According to Shay Addams, ''The Bard's Tale III'' is:

{{blockquote|A much more enjoyable adventure than ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|Bard's Tale I]]'' or ''[[The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight|II]]'' ... Missions involve a wider variety of puzzle types due to a new command that permits you to use objects and artifacts as you would in a text adventure such as ''[[Zork]]''. Other improvements include auto-mapping, new character classes, magic spells and dungeon levels (84 of them!) that vary in size and shape. You also get to visit more exotic lands than in the previous installments, for each quest takes place in its own universe: a forest world, a frozen wasteland, and one that's linked via time warps to different times on earth, from ancient Rome to the Nazi's Berlin. The interface is smooth, [and] the first-person graphics [are] sharp and colorful. Characters from the previous games may be imported into this one, as well as characters from ''[[Ultima III]]'' and ''[[Ultima IV|IV]]'' and the first three ''[[Wizardry]]'' scenarios.<ref name="Quest for Clues II"/>}}

==Reception==

A 1988 review in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' described ''Bard's Tale III'' as an improvement over its predecessor, but "still too heavily oriented towards mega-combat."<ref name = "CGW">{{Cite news | date = June 1988 | author = Scorpia | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_48/page/n19/mode/1up| access-date=March 30, 2023| title = Old Prophecies Never Lie...

The game was reviewed in 1988 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #138 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon138">{{cite journal

==Production==
[[Michael Cranford]], the creator of the ''Bard's Tale'' series, was not involved in this sequel, as he had decided to leave Interplay to study [[philosophy]] and [[theology]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Cranford, Michael |title=The Bard's Tale Compendium |year=1998 |url=http://bardstale.poverellomedia.com/about.html |access-date=February 24, 2011 |work=Interview transcript }}</ref>

''The Bard's Tale III'' programmer Heineman has said that the original name of this game was to be ''Tales of the Unknown - Volume III: The Thief's Tale''. Heineman also once sought to continue creating new ''Bard's Tale'' games, but was unsuccessful in obtaining the rights from [[Electronic Arts]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Heineman, Bill |title=The Bard's Tale Compendium |year=2000 |url=http://bardstale.poverellomedia.com/beyond.html |access-date=July 22, 2009 |work=Chat transcript }}</ref>

[[Michael A. Stackpole]] created the storyline of ''The Bard's Tale III'' and made maps for it. He has since become a successful author, having penned many novels in the hugely popular [[Star Wars]] and [[BattleTech]] series.

Bruce Schlickbernd and Michael Stackpole also collaborated on Interplay's ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'', ''[[Star Trek: 25th Anniversary (computer game)|Star Trek: 25th Anniversary]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Judgment Rites]]''.
