In a retrospective review of the Amstrad version for Retro Gamer, Gavin Eke noted the game's similarly to ''Ghosts 'n Goblins''.  Eke was impressed by the "colourful & smooth" graphics and considered the game to be worth a look for fans of its inspiration.  It was said to be a "flattering tribute".  Gavin Miller reviewed the Atari ST release for the same publication.  He said that although short, consisting of only 3 levels, it did offer a challenge.  Miller concluded: "Overall a great little game with some good music. Would have liked a few more levels though."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/beyond-the-ice-palace/ | title=Beyond the Ice Palace &#124; Retro Gamer | date=31 August 2010 }}</ref>
