{{nihongo foot|'''''Märchen Maze'''''|メルヘンメイズ|Meruhen Meizu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1988 [[platform game|isometric platform]] [[arcade game]] developed by N.H. System and published by [[Namco]]. Controlling a young girl named Alice, the player must complete each of the game's nine stages while avoiding enemies and falling off ledges. Alice can blow powerful bubbles at enemies to knock them back, and can hit them enough times to send them off the platform. It is the first Japanese video game adaptation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', and ran on the [[Namco System 1]] arcade board.

Development was handled by N.H. System, a short-lived subsidiary of Namco, with character design by famed anime director Katsuhiko Nishijima. It is Namco's second game to feature a female protagonist, following ''[[Wonder Momo]]''. The word ''[[Wikt:Märchen|Märchen]]'' ({{IPA-de|ˈmɛːɐ̯çn̩|pron}} {{respell|MEH|kh'n}}) is the German word for "[[fairy tale]]". A PC-Engine version was released in 1990, which replaced the [[isometric view]] with an overhead one, followed by a 1991 Sharp X68000 port. ''Märchen Maze'' received mixed reviews; although its visuals and controls were praised, critics disliked the sharp rise in difficulty and mediocre boss fights. It was digitally re-released for the Japanese [[Wii Virtual Console]] in 2009.

==Gameplay==

The player must take control of Alice, as she makes her way through nine isometric stages. Alice is able to blow bubbles at enemies to knock them off the platforms and she can collect various powerups along the way. Holding the fire button down generates bigger bubbles, but if it is held down for too long, it will burst and she will start blowing a new one. The enemies retaliate by shooting marbles at her (which can cause her to fall over the edge of the platforms unless they are avoided or jumped over).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/20090928_318018.html |title=バンダイナムコ、「メルヘンメイズ」。VCAにて9月29日より配信開始 - GAME Watch |date=28 September 2009 |publisher=Game.watch.impress.co.jp |accessdate=2015-11-06}}</ref> The seventh, eighth and ninth stages are palette-swapped versions of the second, fourth and first ones respectively, but they feature different enemy types and bosses.

==Plot==
One night, Alice falls asleep while reading a fairy tale picture book and is awaken by a call from within a wall mirror. A rabbit appears in the mirror and tells her that his country and eight other lands has been conquered by an evil witch known as the Queen of Darkness and Alice is the only child who has love and courage to restore peace. The girl is pulled inside the mirror world and given a magic straw to attack with soap bubbles. After the Queen is defeated, Alice wakes up thinking it was just a nightmare, but finds the phrase "{{sic|Thanks}} you!" written on the mirror and on a cake.

''Märchen Maze'', notably the PC-Engine release, received mostly mixed reviews — while critics praised its graphics and controls, many would criticize its difficulty for drastically spiking up later on and for its unimpressive boss fights.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=338|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 August 1988|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>

The May 1991 issue of German magazine ''Play Time'' praised the PC-Engine version's "well matched" graphics and amount of action, although would criticize the difficulty for being too hard, namely in the first stage.<ref name="Play Time"/> They also disliked the game's sound effects, jokingly stating that the player would likely instead want to turn on their stereo instead of listening to them.<ref name="Play Time"/> In a retrospective review, Kurt Kalata of ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' liked the game's cute visuals and controls, although stated the game "ran out of steam midway through" for its drastic rise in difficulty and mediocre boss fights.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Märchen Maze |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/marchen-maze/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=7 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322073836/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/marchen-maze/ |archive-date=22 March 2019 |date=13 September 2017}}</ref>

''[[Famitsu]]'' would dislike the PC-Engine version's difficulty for being too drastic early on, although would praise its aesthetic and tight controls. ''PC-Engine Fan'' magazine had a similar response, applauding its controls, visuals and soundtrack while disliking its uninteresting boss fights and high difficulty level, notably on the first stage of the game. Japanese magazine ''[[Gamest]]'' awarded the arcade version the 7th "Best Graphic" and 8th "Best VGM", as well as the 31st "Annual Hit Game" award in January 1998.<ref name="Gamest">{{cite book |title=ゲーメスト大賞11年史 |date=17 January 1998 |publisher=[[Gamest]] |isbn=9784881994290 |edition=Vol. 5}}</ref> They would go on to praise the game's faithfulness to the source material, saying that it was "superbly expressed".<ref name="Gamest"/>

In 1998, the Naniwa (the game's equivalents of [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]]) went on to lend their name to one of the new stadiums (the Naniwa Dome), for the [[Namco System 12]]-era ''[[World Stadium]]'' games, but they did not appear in the Namco All Stars' lineup. In 2002, Alice was featured as a secret playable character in ''Family Tennis Advance''. In 2005, Yujin released [[gashapon]] figures of Alice and Tokei Usagi (the game's equivalent of the [[White Rabbit]]) as part of their "Namco Girls" collection, even though the latter is male. The game's music is included in several of Namco compilation soundtracks. A digital download of the game was released for the Japanese [[Wii Virtual Console]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/08/20/namco-pushes-virtual-console-arcade |title=Namco Pushes Virtual Console Arcade - IGN |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2015-11-06}}</ref>
