{{nihongo|'''''Mirai Ninja'''''|未来忍者|lit. "Future Ninja"}}, is a side scrolling [[beat 'em up]] [[arcade video game]], released by [[Namco]] in 1988 exclusively in Japan. ''Mirai Ninja'' was adapted into the Japanese [[Mirai Ninja (film)|live-action film of the same name]], which was also produced by Namco. The game runs on [[Namco System 2]] hardware, and is the first Namco game to be adapted into a film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mirai Ninja|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=1514|website=flyers.arcade-museum.com|publisher=The Arcade Flyer Archive|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=未来忍者

Character designs and directing of the film were done by [[Keita Amemiya]] of ''[[Zeiram]]'' and ''[[Kamen Rider]]'' fame. Both the game and the movie were released in the same year. Although the arcade game was only released in Japan, the movie was released [[direct-to-video]] overseas by [[Streamline Pictures|Mondo Pop]], under the two titles of ''Cyber Ninja'' in the [[United States]], and ''Warlord'' in [[Canada]].

In both the film and the arcade game a man's body and soul are stolen and used as part of a demon's castle. What's left becomes a cyber-ninja named Shiranui. <!-- the plot made no sense (and was stolen from arcade-history website anyway), needs to be written again --> The player controls Mirai Ninja, who must fight various enemies and bosses by rapidly throwing [[shuriken]]s at them (and slashing them with his [[sword]] at close range). His [[life meter]] uses [[Kanji]] for the numbers; this was previously done in Namco's earlier Japan-only title, ''[[Genpei Tōma Den]]'' (1986), for the score display. The penultimate stage, "Castle Kurosagi", also only has one way out of it.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Mirai Ninja'' on their January 1, 1989 issue as being the tenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=347|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 January 1989|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>
