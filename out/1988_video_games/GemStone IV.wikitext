'''''GemStone IV''''' is a multiplayer text-based online [[role-playing video game]] (often known as a [[Multi-user dungeon|MUD]]) produced by [[Simutronics]]. Players control characters in a [[High fantasy|high fantasy]] game world named "Elanthia".{{R|olivetti}} The first playable version of the game was known as ''GemStone ][''{{R|bartle1}} and was launched in April 1988 on [[GEnie]].{{R|bartle2}} It was one of the first [[MMORPG]]s and is one of the longest running [[Internet|online]] games still active.{{R|dunin}} Access to the game is subscription-based (monthly fee) through its website, with three additional subscriptions levels available, "Premium", "Platinum" and "Shattered", in addition to a free-to-play model introduced in early March 2015.

==Technical information==
[[File:GemstoneIV Wizard Screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|The Wizard Front End for ''GemStone IV''.]]
''GemStone IV'' is a text-based game built on Simutronics' proprietary engine, the IFE (Interactive Fiction Engine). This engine is capable of changing nearly any aspect of the game [[on the fly]] which allows updates without the necessity for [[downtime]]. Due to the use of the IFE, ''GemStone'' is rarely taken offline, giving a 24-hour uptime cycle aside from the occasional game [[Crash (computing)|crash]].

The ''GemStone'' interface is simply a text stream, and the game can be played with a [[Telnet]] interface after authentication. There are several official interfaces to the game, as well as several unofficial ones. The oldest interface for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] is called the "Wizard Front End" and offers several useful features such as status readouts, macros, and limited scripting abilities. The Wizard has since been superseded with the "StormFront" Front End introduced in 2003, which itself has been rebranded as "Wrayth" in 2022. Wrayth offers several additional extensions to the game, including a "point and click" interface that allows one to click on text within the game and bring up action menus applicable to that portion of text. The Java FE and a browser-based version named "eScape" are less popular alternatives. A Wizard (similar to the Windows version) also exists for [[Macintosh Classic]], while a Front End named "Avalon" is available for [[Mac OS X]]. No official [[Linux]] client exists.

==History==
''GemStone'' was first demonstrated to GEnie in 1987 before Simutronics was officially incorporated. It was only used as a demonstration model and was never available to the general subscribers. ''GemStone ]['' was released in April 1988 to GEnie customers. However, ''GemStone ]['' was very short-lived, and ''GemStone III'' went into open beta testing in December 1989, officially launching on February 1, 1990.{{R|washtech}} The transition from "][" to "III" maintained significant portions of the environment, but not all, and character records were not maintained over the transition, requiring all players to begin anew. ''GemStone III'' evolved into ''GemStone IV'' in November 2003, but the game world and character records were maintained over the transition. ''GemStone III'' was promoted on GEnie by promising players the opportunity to receive real-life versions of gems found in-game, something that persisted for many years.

''GemStone'' originally operated with a license to use the Rolemaster game mechanics and [[Shadow World (role playing game)|Shadow World]] environment from [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] (ICE). In 1995, Simutronics and ICE agreed to let the business relationship expire, necessitating the removal of all ICE intellectual property from ''GemStone''. Many of the game changes were simply renaming ICE names, such as changing the world name from [[Kulthea]] to Elanthia, and renaming the deities while keeping their previous characteristics.

Game mechanics were greatly changed with the de-ICEing (as the period is colloquially named), which required every game character to undergo significant changes. Character racial and class choices were also changed, making any direct translation between the two systems difficult. The end result was that every character was required to "re-roll" their character with the option to change race and skills, but maintaining their old experience level, class, and equipment.

''GemStone'' became available on [[AOL]]{{R|bartle3}} in September, 1995, just after the de-ICEing process. It had already become available on [[CompuServe]] and [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]] before that. When AOL switched to flat-rate pricing, ''GemStone'' did over 1.4 million customer-hours in a single month{{R|netpreneur}} and was attracting 2,000-2,500 simultaneous players.{{R|bartle4}} Simutronics launched a web portal in 1997, and started phasing customers off of the online services and onto the web interface, although it would take several years before the last of the online service portals were closed.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1991 stated that ''Gemstone III'' was a good example of the best and worst aspects of online play. The reviewer liked the game's community aspect and well-written prose, but criticized the poor parser, "surprisingly empty" game environment and—given the per-minute charge—lack of a free tutorial, and concluded that "the present incarnation of on-line games doesn't quite work for him".<ref name="wilson199102">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=79 | title=On-Line Gaming Viewed by a Skeptic / Gemstone III, for Example | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=February 1991 | accessdate=17 November 2013 | author=Wilson, Johnny L. | pages=53 | issue=79}}</ref> In a follow-up 1993 review, the reviewer wrote that his sojourn in Kulthea was a rewarding experience. He reported receiving help from both built-in commands and other characters and the ability and opportunity for his bard character to sing. The reviewer concluded that "at last, I know why" the game was so popular.<ref name="wilson199301">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=102 | title=Genie's GemStone III | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=January 1993 | accessdate=5 July 2014 | author=Wilson, Johnny L. | pages=124}}</ref> In 1997 ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' named it as number seven on their "Top 10 Online Game Picks".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Next Generation's Top 10 Online Game Picks |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=27|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=March 1997|page=42}}</ref> At its peak (1996), ''GemStone III'' had over 2,000 simultaneous users and 1 million play hours per month, large numbers for its era.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Landau |first1=Elizabeth |title=I Had My First Kiss in GemStone III |url=https://gizmodo.com/i-had-my-first-kiss-in-gemstone-iii-1845229020 |website=Gizmodo |date=30 September 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref>

In 2020 and 2021, ''GemStone III'' inspired retrospectives by [[Elizabeth Landau]] in [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] and [[Gizmodo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ep. 20: Text Adventure Gemstone III with Liz Landau |url=https://gamehistory.org/ep-20-text-adventure-gemstone-iii-with-liz-landau/ |website=Video Game History Foundation |date=24 February 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/story/multiplayer-text-games-mud-mmo-social-media/|author=Landau, Liz|date=January 14, 2021|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|title=How old-school text adventures inspired our virtual spaces}}</ref> She noted its ability to facilitate human communication and its similar nature to later [[MMORPG]]s and [[social media]].
