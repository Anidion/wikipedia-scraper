'''''Gradius II'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{Nihongo|グラディウスII {{ruby|GOFER|ゴーファー}}の{{ruby|野望|やぼう}}|Gradiusu Tsū: Gofā no Yabō|lit. Gradius II: Gofer's Ambition}}}} (also known as '''''Vulcan Venture''''' in arcades outside Japan) is a [[side-scrolling shooter]] game developed and published by [[Konami]]. Originally released for the [[arcade game|arcades]] in Japan in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], it is the sequel to original ''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]'' and was succeeded by ''[[Gradius III]]''. Ports of ''Gradius II'' were released for the [[Family Computer]] (under the shortened title of ''Gradius II''), [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD/CD-ROM²|PC-Engine Super CD-ROM²]], and the [[X68000]] in Japan. The original arcade version is also included in the ''Gradius Deluxe Pack'' compilation for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]] and in ''[[Gradius Collection]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]].

==Gameplay==
The player returns as the role of the pilot of the [[Vic Viper]] spaceship to battle the second onslaughts of the Bacterion Empire, under the new leadership of Gofer, the giant head. ''Gradius II'' has kept the gameplay from the original game, but infused it with enhancements brought from the spin-off, ''[[Salamander (video game)|Salamander]]'' (Life Force). This is primarily evident in two of the weapons configurations that are selectable. Another first in the series was the inclusion of the "boss rush" (also known as "boss parade" or "boss alley"), a level designed entirely with only [[boss (video games)|boss]] confrontations.

''Gradius II'' retains the selection bar from ''Gradius'', but now the player can choose between four different weapon configurations and progressions. All schemes have speed-up and multiples (Options), but have differing 'Missile', 'Double' (laser), and 'Laser' weapons. The player can have at most four multiples. Additionally, there are also two types of shielding to choose from: shield and forcefield. The shield option adds more durability, but only for the front of the Vic Viper, while the forcefield adds protection for the entire spacecraft, albeit only against three hits. In the Famicom version, choosing another multiple after four will make the four multiples to move around the spacecraft for 16 seconds; force field is the only shielding available for protection of the entire spacecraft, withstanding five hits and it is included in four different weapon configurations and progressions; and 'Double' and 'Laser' have to be activated twice to achieve full performance.

The PC Engine version offers a different ending screen after completing the game, depending on  difficulty select.

==Release==
The game was first ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in 1988 and was never released outside Japan. Presumably this was due to the fact that the Famicom version employed a custom memory mapper dubbed the VRC4,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disk-kun.com/handbills/gradius-ii|title=Gradius II promotional flyer|website=DISK-KUN|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311102155/http://disk-kun.com/handbills/gradius-ii|archive-date=2016-03-11}}</ref> which enhanced some of the game's graphics and sounds, such as animation and voices, thus converting the game to a standard memory mapper (as Konami later did with ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'') would have been too time-consuming (since the original ''Gradius'' was not as popular overseas as it was in Japan).

A [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD/CD-ROM²|PC-Engine Super CD-ROM²]] port was later released only in Japan in 1992. The graphics remained nearly unaltered, the [[background music]] is mostly the arcade version's soundtrack in redbook audio format, and one additional stage was added that is similar to the temple stage in the NES version of ''[[Salamander (video game)|Life Force]]'' and the first stage of ''[[Gradius III]]''.

''Gradius II'' was later re-released in the Japanese exclusive ''[[Gradius Deluxe Pack]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 1996, and for the first time a worldwide release on the ''[[Gradius Collection]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2006. There was also a release for Mobile phones on 2004 and Windows Phone on 2010. No version of ''Gradius II'' saw a release in [[North America]] until its inclusion in the ''Gradius Collection'' in [[2006 in video gaming|2006]]. The Famicom and PC Engine ports were re-released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in [[2007 in video gaming|2007]], the latter getting an international release. It is part of the "Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection", released on Nintendo Switch in 2019, and separately as part of the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' series, released in 2020.
