'''''Silkworm''''' is a [[scrolling shooter|horizontally scrolling shooter]] developed by [[Tecmo]] and first released for arcades in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]].  In [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] it was ported to the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] (1990) systems by [[SCi Games|The Sales Curve]] and released by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Mastertronic]].

''Silkworm'' inspired the game ''[[SWIV]]'', while not a direct sequel, it followed the same core gameplay design of a helicopter/jeep team, albeit as a vertically scrolling shooter instead of a horizontally scrolling one and was described as "inspired by" and a spiritual successor by several reviews, both of the time and contemporary, respectively.

==Release==
''Silkworm'' was released at a time where side-scrolling shooting games were among the most popular genres - it was released at the same time as ''[[Forgotten Worlds]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/ys43.htm |title=The YS Rock'n'Roll Years - Issue 43 |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-01-22}}</ref> ''[[Sanxion]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/ys42.htm |title=The YS Rock'n'Roll Years - Issue 42 |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-01-22}}</ref> ''[[Mr. Heli]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/ys44.htm |title=The YS Rock'n'Roll Years - Issue 44 |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-01-22}}</ref> and ''DNA Warrior''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/ys41.htm |title=The YS Rock'n'Roll Years - Issue 41 |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-01-22 |archive-date=28 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528101223/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/ys41.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Spectrum version took three months to develop and was converted from the Amiga version which was almost identical to the original.<ref name="SU87">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue087/Pages/SinclairUser08700060.jpg {{Bare URL image|date=March 2022}}</ref> The game reached number three in the UK Spectrum sales charts, behind ''[[RoboCop (1988 video game)|RoboCop]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ninja]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/ys46.htm |title=The YS Rock'n'Roll Years - Issue 46 |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-01-22}}</ref>

In November 1990, Virgin re-released ''Silkworm'' as part of the ''Edition 1'' compilation, which also included ''[[Double Dragon]]'', and the shoot'em ups ''Gemini Wing'', and ''[[Xenon (video game)|Xenon]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/edition1.htm |title=Edition 1 |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-01-22}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Silkworm1.png|thumb|left|''Silkworm'' on the [[Amiga]]]]
The player can take control of a [[jeep]] mounted with a machine gun or a [[helicopter]] mounted with forward and downward firing guns. Two players can work simultaneously and [[Cooperative video game|cooperatively]] against enemies, with one playing as the jeep and one as the helicopter.

Silkworm featured a variety of enemies, some of which had specific weaknesses, such as the armoured AA guns that could only be harmed when their shields were down to fire. Enemies included the "Goose" helicopter - a giant, heavily armoured "mini-boss" helicopter that was composed of several smaller vehicles connected together.

The players collect shields (which could alternatively be shot by the player in order to destroy all enemies on the screen), power cells which increase firepower and an additional bonus can be added to the score achieved. The game gets harder on the completion of each level, which feature destructible environmental elements, such as buildings and ancient ruins.

The speed was one of the defining parts of the gameplay, which the programmers who worked on the home conversions were keen to preserve, using a variety of programming techniques.<ref name="SU87" /> Silkworm featured a background music theme composed by [[Barry Leitch]], which went on to be included on a ''Sinclair User'' [[covermount]]ed cassette, along with  ''[[Shinobi]]'' and ''[[Continental Circus]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0013713 | title=World of Spectrum - Sinclair User issue 92: 6 Amazing Coin-Op Tracks }}</ref>

==Ending==
As an arcade game Silkworm has no ending, but the home conversions were altered to have either a victory screen, or a more involved final sequence.<ref>{{cite AV media| url-status = live| archive-url = https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/UoDJS_5yr_w| archive-date = 2021-12-11| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoDJS_5yr_w| title = Silkworm (Amiga 50Hz) - All Clear / No Miss (Heli) - 1,229,600 points | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=ChinnyVision - Ep 297 - Silkworm - C64, Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Amiga|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRQAQr0HPGM |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/FRQAQr0HPGM |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|language=en|access-date=2019-08-30}}{{cbignore}}</ref>  The end text reads:

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Silkworm'' on their April 1, 1988 issue as being the fifth most popular table arcade unit at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=329|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 April 1988|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>

The game was well received. Your Sinclair praised the 2-player mode and the sound effects.

==Legacy==
The game ''[[SWIV]]'' was considered a spiritual successor to ''Silkworm'', which [[SCi Games|The Sales Curve]] had previously converted to home computer formats in 1989. The game's heritage is evident from the game design whereby one player pilots a [[helicopter]], and the other an armoured [[Jeep]]. ''SWIV'' is not an official sequel, as noted by ex-Sales Curve producer Dan Marchant: "''SWIV'' wasn't really a sequel to ''Silkworm'', but it was certainly inspired by it and several other shoot-'em-ups that we had played and loved."<ref>Bevan, Mike (2008). "The Making of SWIV", Retro Gamer (58): 40-43.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-swiv|title=The story of SWIV|last=Mason|first=Graeme|date=30 Jul 2023|work=[[Gamer Network|Eurogamer.net]]|access-date=9 September 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/crash-magazine-87/page/n48/mode/1up?view=theater|title=SWIV review|last=Caswell|first=Mark|date=April 1991|work=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|publisher=[[Newsfield]]|access-date=9 September 2023}}</ref>

''SWIV'' was described in the game's manual as meaning both "Special Weapons Intercept Vehicles" and "Silkworm IV".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ace-magazine-40/page/n41/mode/1up?view=theater|title=ACE - Issue 40 |publisher=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]  |accessdate=2023-09-09}}</ref>
