{{nihongo foot|'''''Galaxy Force'''''|ギャラクシーフォース|Gyarakushī Fōsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[rail shooter]] video game developed and released by [[Sega]] for [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1988. The player assumes control of a starship named the TRY-Z, as it must prevent the Fourth Empire from taking over the entire [[galaxy]]. Gameplay involves shooting down enemies using either a [[Laser|laser shot]] or a limited supply of heat-seeking missiles, all while avoiding collision with projectiles or obstacles and making sure the ship's energy meter doesn't fully deplete. It ran on the [[Sega Y Board]] arcade system, and was released with a [[motion simulator]] cockpit [[arcade cabinet]] version like previous [[Sega Super Scaler]] games (''[[Space Harrier]]'', ''[[After Burner]]'' and ''[[Thunder Blade]]'').<ref name="arcadeheroes"/><ref name="TheOne"/>

Created by the same group of developers that later went on to form [[Sega AM1]], ''Galaxy Force'' was developed specifically to show off the capabilities of the Sega Y hardware with its usage of large, detailed backgrounds and massive amount of on-screen [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. The game is part of Sega's [[Sega Super Scaler|Super Scaler]] line of [[arcade cabinet]]s, alongside titles such as ''[[Out Run]]'' and ''[[Space Harrier]]''. It was largely inspired by ''[[Star Wars]]''. The soundtrack was composed jointly by Katsuhiro Hayashi and Kouichi Namaki, both of whom previously created the music for ''[[Thunder Blade]]''. The game came in three different cabinet styles; a standard upright, a "Deluxe" machine, and a "Super Deluxe" version that could twist and turn the player around. Almost immediately after the game's release, Sega published an updated version titled '''''Galaxy Force II''''' which added two new levels and other minor additions.

''Galaxy Force'' was critically acclaimed, being praised for its graphics, gameplay, presentation, music and hardware capabilities, considered to be visually impressive for the time period. It was ported to several platforms, including the [[Master System]], [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] and [[Commodore 64]], as well as being released under several different Sega classic game re-release labels such as ''[[Sega Ages]]''. A high-definition remake titled ''Galaxy Force Neo Classic'' was released for the PlayStation 2 in ''Galaxy Force II Special Extended Edition'', alongside the original, which featured smoothed-out graphics and additional visual effects. With the exception of the Master System version, all home versions of the game are based on ''Galaxy Force II''.

===''Galaxy Force II''===
Two months after the game was released, Sega published ''Galaxy Force II'' as a conversion kit; it is not a sequel, but rather an updated version of the original that adds two new levels, corrects many difficulty balance problems, and allows the player to fire all four missiles at once instead of one at a time.<ref name="HG101"/> Almost all home releases of ''Galaxy Force'' are based on ''Galaxy Force II'';<ref name="HG101"/> the first of these was released in 1990 for the [[FM Towns]], followed by a port for the [[Sega Genesis]]; both of these were developed by Japanese company [[CRI Middleware]].<ref name="HG101"/> A version for the [[Master System]] was also released, which was published by Sega in Europe and by [[Activision]] in Europe.<ref name="HG101"/> The Master System port was completely redone to accommodate for the console's technical limitations, bearing a much closer resemblance to ''Space Harrier'', and is the only port not to be based on ''Galaxy Force II''.<ref name="HG101"/> ''Galaxy Force'' was also ported to several home computers, including the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Amstrad]].<ref name="HG101"/>

In 1998, ''Galaxy Force II'' was released for the [[Sega Saturn]] as part of the ''[[Sega Ages]]'' series of classic game re-releases, including a brief background on the game's story and the ability to watch a pre-recorded playthrough.<ref name="HG101"/> A [[PlayStation 2]] version was released in Japan in 2007 under the ''Sega Ages 2500'' brand, developed by [[M2 (game developer)|M2]] and titled ''Galaxy Force II: Special Extended Edition''. It includes the arcade, Master System and Genesis versions of the original, alongside a new "Neo Classic" remake that features smooth, enhanced graphics, transparency effects and visual cues. ''Special Extended Edition'' also allows the player to select either the original or FM Towns version soundtracks, gain access to a cheat menu, and arranged music tracks.<ref name="HG101"/> A version for Japanese mobile phones was published in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=端末を傾けて機体を操作！ 『ギャラクシーフォースII』登場 |url=https://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/083/83872/ |website=Dengeki Online |publisher=Dengeki |access-date=16 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190205183555/https://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/083/83872/ |archive-date=5 February 2019 |date=2 June 2008}}</ref><ref name="HG101"/> The Sega Genesis version was digitally re-released for the [[Wii Virtual Console]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hinkle |first1=David |title=VC in Brief: Galaxy Force II (Sega Genesis) |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/05/11/vc-in-brief-galaxy-force-ii-sega-genesis/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |access-date=16 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200216014007/https://www.engadget.com/2009/05/11/vc-in-brief-galaxy-force-ii-sega-genesis/ |archive-date=16 February 2020 |date=11 May 2009}}</ref> In 2013, ''Galaxy Force II'' was ported to the [[Nintendo 3DS]] by M2 under the [[3D Classics]] brand, renamed ''3D Galaxy Force II'' and supporting the system's 3D display.

''Galaxy Force'' was critically acclaimed by a number of publications, and is seen among Sega's best arcade games of the era.<ref name="HG101"/> In late 1988, ''[[Sinclair User]]'' gave the game the "Shoot 'Em Up of the Year" award for its impressive graphics and hardware.<ref name="award"/>

Several critics commented on the game's visuals. ''[[Commodore User]]'' found the arcade game's visuals to be much more detailed than those in Sega's previous game ''[[After Burner]]'', and applauded them for being stunning and impressive.<ref name="CUser"/> ''Sinclair User'' agreed, arguing that it usurps ''[[Thunder Blade]]'' in its graphics.<ref name="SUser"/> ''TheOne'' magazine also liked the visuals.<ref name="TheOne"/> Reviewing the Nintendo 3DS version, ''Nintendo World Report'' commented on the graphics for being impressive for a 2D game,<ref name="NWR"/> which ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' and ''[[Eurogamer]]'' agreed with.<ref name="NLife"/><ref name="EuroG"/> ''Nintendo Life'' also added that the graphics of ''Galaxy Force'' present "a tantalizing glimpse into what interactive entertainment could have looked like had polygons never happened".<ref name="NLife"/> ''[[Mean Machines]]'' was critical of the graphics in the Sega Mega Drive conversion, saying that they only looked good when the player was moving in a straight direction.<ref name="MeanM"/> ''Mean Machines'' also disliked the port's "crummy" sound effects and mediocre presentation.<ref name="MeanM"/>

''Galaxy Force'' was widely praised for its gameplay. While ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' said that it felt "more of a simulator than a game", they liked its fast-paced action.<ref name="TheOne">{{cite magazine |title=Conversions Galore from Mediagenic |url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-01/page/n13/mode/2up |access-date=16 February 2020 |magazine=[[The One (magazine)|The One]] |issue=1 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |date=October 1988 |pages=15–16}}</ref> Both ''Commodore User'' and ''Sinclair User'' commended the gameplay of ''Galaxy Force'' for its focus on speed,<ref name="CUser"/><ref name="SUser"/> with ''Sinclair User'' saying that it was "possibly the most mind-blowingly impressive arcade game" of the time.<ref name="SUser"/> ''Nintendo Life'' labeled the 3DS version as "arguably the culmination of M2's 3D Classics range" for its great gameplay and overall challenge, adding that it was a great conversion of the game overall.<ref name="NLife"/> ''Nintendo World Report'', who felt it was the best of the 3D Classics lineup, agreed and said that its extra features made it the best way to play the game.<ref name="NWR"/> ''Mean Machines'' lampooned the Genesis version further for its gameplay and poor job at converting the arcade version for the system, alongside its sluggish pace and overall lack of any real challenge.<ref name="MeanM"/> ''Sega Saturn Magazine'' liked the Sega Saturn version for its great effort at converting the game for the Saturn hardware and was still a fun game, but its lack of any real additional extras made it somewhat of a hard sell for consumers.<ref name="SSMJP"/>

Retrospectively, ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' applauded ''Galaxy Force'' for its visuals, gameplay and overall presentation.<ref name="HG101"/> Although they felt the game felt more like an amusement ride than a game, and was too difficult at times, they liked the game for being impressive for its time, writing: "''Galaxy Force'' is still an incredibly impressive feat of programming, a work of art in its own way".<ref name="HG101"/> In his book ''The Sega Arcade Revolution'', Ken Horowitz commented on the game's graphics, presentation and technological capabilities, saying that ''Galaxy Force'' "remains a prime example of the company at its best, combining gameplay and presentation into one of the more memorable arcade experiences".<ref name="Horowitz">{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games |date=22 June 2018 |publisher=McFarland & Company |isbn=978-1476672250 |pages=132–134}}</ref>
