'''''Bonze Adventure''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Jigoku Meguri'''''|地獄めぐり|lit. "Hell Tour"}}, is a [[platform game]] developed by [[Taito]] and released in arcades in 1988. A [[PC Engine]] port was published in 1990.

==Plot==
[[Yama (Buddhism)#Yama in Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese mythology|Emma]] the King has lost his senses, causing him to lose order of his [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Underworld]] domain – enabling [[Good and evil#Buddhism|evil]] entities to roam freely. The player controls [[Bonze]] Kackremboh, a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Bhikkhu|priest]] who is son of the [[Tianlong#Buddhist usages|Divine Dragon]]. Kackremboh must now go on a journey to find and confront Emma. In order to find Emma, Bonze must survive against hordes of [[yokai]], such as snakes, giant eyeballs, ghosts, [[kitsune]], spiders, entities appearing to be [[hitodama]]/[[will-o'-the-wisp]], as well as other evils.

==Gameplay==
The priest's weapons are [[Buddhist prayer beads]], called "mala" beads, which can be powered up until they become almost as large as the priest himself. In times of difficulty, a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]] often provides various [[power-up]]s to assist the priest's progress. In an unusual twist, the allotted time appears in the manner of melting [[Offering (Buddhism)|candles]], rather than a traditional timer. The game consists of several rounds: Dilapidated Backyard [[Japanese funeral|Cemetery]], The Dead-or-Alive River, [[Naraka (Buddhism)#Hot Narakas|Burning Inferno]], Bloody Pond, [[Naraka (Buddhism)#Cold Narakas|Glacier Trap]], Lose-Your-Way-Maze, and finally Emma's Lair.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Bonze Adventure'' on their July 15, 1988 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=336|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 July 1988|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>

Bonze Kackremboh later made an appearance in the ''[[Let's! TV Play Classic]]'' series in ''Kiki Kaikai Kackremboh''.
