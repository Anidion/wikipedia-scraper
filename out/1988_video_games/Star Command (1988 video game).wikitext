[[Orson Scott Card]] was less favorable, writing in ''[[Compute!]]'' that ''Star Command'' "wants to be ''[[Starflight]]'' or ''[[Sentinel Worlds I: Future Magic|Sentinel Worlds]]'', but it isn't". He said that the "primitive graphics" were adequate, but "the problem is that there's no sense of ''experiencing'' anything. Mostly you're [[exposition (narrative)|told about what's going on]], and after a short time it seemed to me that it was a text game which consisted of" mechanical [[fetch quest]]s.<ref name="card198906">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-06-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_109_1989_Jun#page/n29/mode/2up |title=Light-years and Lasers / Science Fiction Inside Your Computer |magazine=Compute! |date=June 1989 |last=Card |first=Orson Scott |authorlink=Orson Scott Card |pages=29}}</ref> In a 1992 survey of science fiction games, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave the title two-plus stars of five,<ref name="brooks199211">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_100 |title=Strategy & Wargames: The Future (2000-....) |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=November 1992 |author=Brooks, M.
