{{nihongo|'''''Phantom Fighter'''''|霊幻道士|Reigen Dōshi}} is a [[beat 'em up]] video game released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1988 in Japan, and in April 1990 in the United States. The Japanese version is based on the 1985 film, ''[[Mr. Vampire]]'' (''Reigen Dōshi'' being the Japanese title of the film).

==Gameplay==
As a kung-fu master, the player must fight through eight towns filled with [[Jiangshi|kyonshi]] (Chinese vampires), each with a unique town boss, until the final confrontation with an evil witch. An infinite amount of continues are available to complete the game.

A small selection of items, and a large selection of fighting moves, could be used on the enemy. The game also included a hidden character that made the game much more difficult, a baby kyonshi or "conshi." Instead of keeping track of available items, the game's inventory screen tabulates all the possible items in the game.

==Reception==
[[AllGame]] gave the game a score of 3 out of 5 stars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=264 |title=Phantom Fighter - Overview - allgame |website=www.allgame.com |access-date=12 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115040016/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=264 |archive-date=15 November 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
