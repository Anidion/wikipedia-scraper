'''''Hot Chase''''' is an arcade game released in 1988 by [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hot Chase|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8142|work=Arcade Museum|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref> In the game, players drive a white [[Porsche 959]] out of an enemy country to the [[border checkpoint|Border crossing]] of a friendly one. The car has a bomb attached to it that explodes in a set time. If the bomb explodes, players must restart. There are many obstacles along the way, including [[railroad crossing]]s, military checkpoints, helicopters that shoot at the car and other cars. The gameplay is said to be similar to ''[[Chase H.Q.]]''.

==Ending==
Completing the game resulted in a scene where the hero exits the car, takes his machine gun, and fires at the car to add to the damage before the bomb explodes. Then the game played the following message: "Mission Complete. You have succeeded in stealing the enemy armored super car and have crossed the border to freedom. After a few days the enemy surrendered to our country. You will be remembered for your brave deeds. Thanks a million!"

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Hot Chase'' on their January 15, 1989 issue as being the eighth most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=348|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 January 1989|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>
