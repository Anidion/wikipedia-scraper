}}'''''Mega Man 2'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''''Rockman 2: Dr. Wily no Nazo'''''|ロックマン2 Dr.ワイリーの謎|Rokkuman 2: Dr. Wairī no Nazo|group=lower-alpha|extra=lit. 'Rockman 2: The Mystery of Dr. Wily'|lead=yes}}}}  (stylized as '''''MEGA MAN II''''')  is an [[action game]] developed and published by [[Capcom]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was released in [[Japan]] in 1988 and in [[North America]] and [[PAL region]]s the following years. ''Mega Man 2'' continues [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]]'s battle against the evil [[Dr. Wily]] and his rogue robots. It introduced graphical and gameplay changes, many of which became series staples.

Although sales for the original ''[[Mega Man (1987 video game)|Mega Man]] ''were unimpressive, Capcom allowed the team to create a sequel. They worked concurrently on other Capcom projects, using their free time to develop the game, using unused content from the first game. Takashi Tateishi composed the soundtrack, with Yoshihiro Sakaguchi serving as a sound programmer.

''Mega Man 2'' is the second best selling [[Mega Man (original series)|''Mega Man'']] game, with more than 1.51 million copies sold. Critics praised its audio, visuals and gameplay as an improvement over the first game. Many publications rank ''Mega Man 2'' as the best game in the series and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The game's soundtrack has also been considered [[List of video game soundtracks considered the best|one of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time]]. It has been included in several game compilations such as ''[[Mega Man Legacy Collection]]'', rereleased for [[Mobile phone|mobile devices]], and become a part of console [[Emulator|emulation]] services. A sequel, ''[[Mega Man 3]]'', was released in 1990.

==Plot==
After his initial defeat, Dr. Wily, the series' main [[antagonist]], creates his own set of Robot Masters in an attempt to counter Mega Man: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man. He also constructs a new fortress and army of robotic henchmen.
Mega Man is then sent by his creator, [[Doctor Light (Mega Man)|Dr. Light]], to defeat Dr. Wily and his Robot Masters.<ref name="NP-7">{{cite magazine|magazine = [[Nintendo Power]]|publisher = [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]|title = ''Mega Man II''|pages = 8–23|author = ''Nintendo Power'' Staff|date = July–August 1989|issue = 7| issn=1041-9551}}</ref> Mega Man defeats the eight new Robot Masters and then challenges Wily himself.<ref name="RG-49">{{cite magazine|magazine = [[Retro Gamer]]|publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]|title = The Classic Game: ''Mega Man II''|pages = 36–7|author = ''Retro Gamer'' Staff|date = May 2008|issue = 49|issn = 1742-3155}}</ref> During the final fight, Dr. Wily flees into the caves beneath his fortress and when Mega Man follows, attempts to trick Mega Man into thinking he is a [[Extraterrestrial life|space alien]], but Mega Man defeats the alien revealing it to be a [[Holography|holographic]] projection device which malfunctions showing Dr. Wily at the controls. After the scientist begs for mercy, Mega Man spares Wily and returns home.

==Gameplay==
[[File:MegaMan2 Platforms.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]] uses the floating platform items to jump to a difficult-to-reach ladder in the Crash Man stage.|alt=A square video game screenshot that depicts a character sprite standing on a red floating platform between two yellow structures near the top and bottom of the image.]]
Like [[Mega Man (1987 video game)|its predecessor]], ''Mega Man 2'' is a platform and [[action game]]. The player controls Mega Man as he traverses eight stages to defeat the [[boss (video game)|bosses]], Dr. Wily's Robot Masters: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man. Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and a stage related to their weapon's power. For example, Air Man shoots small tornadoes and is fought in a sky-themed level, while Wood Man can use a shield of leaves and is found in a forest-themed stage.<ref name="NP-7"/> After defeating a boss, their signature weapon becomes available to the player. Each Robot Master is weak to the weapons of certain other Robot Masters; therefore, choosing the order in which the levels are played is a vital component of the gameplay.<ref name="RG-49"/><ref name="manual">{{cite book |editor = Capcom|title = Mega Man 2 ''Instruction Booklet''|date = July 1989|publisher = [[Capcom]]|pages = 6–9}}</ref> After completing certain stages, Mega Man receives a special item.<ref name="manual"/> These items create platforms that allow Mega Man to access areas that he otherwise could not.<ref name="NP-7"/>

After defeating the eight Robot Masters, the player proceeds to Dr. Wily's fortress, which consists of six levels that are played linearly.<ref name="NP-7"/> As in the first game, the player is required to fight each Robot Master a second time in Dr. Wily's fortress. However, these battles take place in a single room rather than a series of linearly connected rooms. The room contains teleportation devices that lead to each Robot Master. The devices can be entered in any order, but are not labeled. Once the bosses are defeated again, the player must fight Dr. Wily.

''Mega Man 2'' features a few gameplay changes from the original ''Mega Man''.<ref name="RG-49"/> A new item, the Energy Tank, allows a player to refill Mega Man's health at any time.<ref name="manual"/> Also introduced is a password system.<ref name="NP-7"/> A password is displayed after defeating each Robot Master, allowing the player to return to that particular point in the game after restarting the system.<ref name="manual"/> The password stores the particular list of completed Robot Masters, as well as the number of accumulated Energy Tanks. Unlike the first game, ''Mega Man 2'' does not feature a score counter, and the player is unable to return to Robot Master levels once completed.

===Soundtrack===

The soundtrack for ''Mega Man 2'' was composed by Takashi Tateishi (credited as Ogeretsu Kun), with ''Mega Man'' composer [[Manami Matsumae]] (credited as Manami Ietel) included for having her work on the credits theme from the first game repurposed for the title screen, and for co-composing a minor part of the melody for Air Man's stage.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taher|first1=Mohammed|title=A Conversation with Manami Matsumae|url=http://koopa.tv/a-conversation-with-manami-matsumae/|publisher=Koopa Soundworks|access-date=August 19, 2015|archive-date=February 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211131435/http://koopa.tv/a-conversation-with-manami-matsumae/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Matsumae had been moved to the arcade division, considered more prestigious at the time, which necessitated a new composer. Matsumae and Tateishi worked closely during their time at Capcom, with Tateishi assisting Matsumae with ''[[U.N. Squadron]]'' in a similar manner during the period, albeit uncredited. Tateishi's musical background was unusual compared to his contemporaries at Capcom, in that he had not been [[classically trained]] but was instead drawing on his experience performing in a band. He sought to consciously move away from the more classical sounding themes that were common at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/takashitateishiinterview/|title=Takashi Tateishi Interview: A Career After Mega Man 2|date=November 25, 2010|website=VGMO -Video Game Music Online-}}</ref> He was also relatively new to the games industry, having only been hired by Capcom earlier that year for ''Mad Gear'' (1988). Tateishi would not remain with the franchise after ''Mega Man 2'', as he and Kitamura both resigned from Capcom soon afterwards to work on ''[[Cocoron]]''.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Takashi Tateishi |url=https://bravewave.net/interviews/takashi-tateishi |access-date=2022-12-08 |website=Brave Wave Productions |language=en-US}}</ref>

Tateishi's initial compositions for the game were of varying moods, with some of them being considered "too cute" by Kitamura, requesting them to be changed to fit in with the rest of the soundtrack. A single fragment of this declined concept remains in the game as Crash Man's stage theme. Tateishi has indicated that "no one has" the earlier, softer score. Stylistically the score was influenced by [[Mezzoforte (band)|Mezzoforte]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]].<ref name=":2" />

The widely praised piece used for the first two Wily stages was heavily compromised due to data limitations, with Tateishi being forced to use the first eight measures of the song multiple times throughout it. Tateishi intended to compose a song exclusive to the second stage, but also abandoned this idea for the same reasons.<ref>{{cite web | author=Reploid21XX | title=Go Behind the Scenes of Mega Man 2 with Composer Takashi Tateishi | url=https://www.rockman-corner.com/2019/01/go-behind-scenes-of-mega-man-2-with.html | publisher=Rockman Corner | access-date=February 13, 2021}}</ref> 

As with the previous game, the sound programming was handled by Yoshihiro Sakaguchi, credited as Yuukichan's Papa.<ref>{{cite web | author=Greening, Chris | title=Interview with the ''Mega Man 1'' & ''2'' Sound Team: Reunited 20 Years On | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/manamimatsumae.shtml | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | access-date=February 19, 2011}}</ref>

Though the first ''Mega Man'' game had relatively low sales, ''Mega Man 2'' was a huge success. Since its 1988 release, ''Mega Man 2'' has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide.

''Mega Man 2'' was critically praised. ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s four reviewers—Steve Harris, Ed Semrad, Donn Nauert, and Jim Allee—rated the game favorably, each scoring it 8 out of 10. They stated that it was better than the first ''Mega Man'', citing the improved audio-visuals, new power-ups, and password system.

The game was also adapted into the third story arc for the [[Archie Comics]] [[Mega Man (Archie Comics)|''Mega Man'' comic]], "The Return of Dr. Wily."

All the Robot Masters are defeated but Mega Man ends up under Dr. Wily's control until the [[Mega Man Powered Up]] Robot Masters come to his rescue. Dr. Wily escapes and sets his course for the Lanfront Ruins in South America, foreshadowing an adaptation of ''[[Super Adventure Rockman]].''
