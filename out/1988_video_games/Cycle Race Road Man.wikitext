==Gameplay==

===General gameplay===
It is the player's ultimate objective to make it all the way around [[Japan]]. Players who end up completely damaging the bicycle, running out of energy, or falling behind a certain ranking, will automatically lose the race. Players can choose a representative from either ''[[United States|Team USA]]'', ''[[Japan|Team Japan]]'', ''[[France|Team France]]'', or ''[[Italy|Team Italy]]''.<ref name="seesaa">{{cite web| url = http://mayulog.seesaa.net/article/7407365.html| title = General game overview| language = Japanese| publisher = Seesaa| date = | accessdate = 2009-01-28| archive-date = 2006-01-09| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060109010905/http://mayulog.seesaa.net/article/7407365.html| url-status = dead}}</ref> As long as the player has at least one spare bicycle in the inventory, games will never end on a completely damaged bicycle. [[Password (video games)|Passwords]] are used to save the game.

The race is 4,000 kilometers long (2485.5 miles). Players must traverse the countryside that separates major Japanese cities along the coastline during the course of these 4,000 kilometres.<ref name="seesaa"/> Interesting scenery includes forests and cattle farms.

Players are always given the exact altitude of each section; they are also shown how far in a stage the player has to advance in order to reach the finish line.<ref name="webry">{{cite web | url = http://mii5.at.webry.info/201102/article_3.html| title = Advanced game overview |language=Japanese | publisher = Webry | date = 13 February 2011| accessdate = 2013-01-15}}</ref>

===Strategy elements===
[[Image:Cycleraceroadmanracescreen.PNG|thumb|right|The rider is going 66 kilometres per hour (41 miles per hour) and has reached the top ten ranking for that section.]]

Teammates give out useful power-ups that increase the speed of the bicycle.<ref name="webry"/> The power-ups can also give the player the opportunity to make on the spot [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|repairs]], and extra energy (i.e., water or [[energy drink]]) for those longer courses. Each team has five members to choose from; each with their own strengths and weaknesses and a name that is typical of his nationality.<ref name="webry"/> Points (which are used as currency) are earned by finishing as close to first place as possible. Once acquired, points can be used to buy bicycles that are faster and longer lasting.<ref name="seesaa"/> Bicycle sales cannot be cancelled or revoked; discarding a bike is only possible by intentionally destroying them in a race. Bicycles come in different colors including green, red and blue.

There are also technical differences with the different bicycles. Some are better in higher altitude places like mountains while others function better in lower altitude places like valleys and flat land. However, there are also bicycles that can endure both high altitude and low altitude places. Endurance is linked directly to the weight and speed of the bicycle. Longer races require bicycles with a larger endurance rating.
