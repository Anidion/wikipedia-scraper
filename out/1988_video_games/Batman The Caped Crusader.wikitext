'''''Batman: The Caped Crusader''''' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game developed by Special FX Software ([[Jonathan Smith (games programmer)|Jonathan Smith]], Zach Townsend, Charles Davies, and Keith Tinman) and published by [[Ocean Software]] in 1988. It was licensed by [[Data East]] and Erbe Software for release in North America and Spain. It was the second of three unrelated Batman games released by Ocean, after ''[[Batman (1986 video game)|Batman]]'' in 1986 and preceding ''[[Batman (1989 video game)|Batman: The Movie]]'' in 1989. The Apple II version was developed by [[California]]-based [[Quicksilver Software]]; it requires a 128k IIe or IIc to run. As with many other Ocean releases, the C64 port came in separate cassette and disk releases; the North American NTSC version was based on the latter. The disk version contained slightly remixed music and differences in enemy spawns.

==Gameplay==

''Batman: The Caped Crusader'' is an [[action-adventure game|arcade adventure]] which uses a unique style, innovated by Jonathan Smith and Charles Davies, to display the action as though it takes place in a comic book.<ref>{{cite web|title=Special FX|url=http://www.retrogamer.net/profiles/company/special-fx/|website=Retro Gamer|date=15 May 2014 |publisher=Imagine Publishing|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref> This technique involved having each game location set in its own panel, often with a comic book style caption in the upper-left corner, with inactive panels faded out behind the current active location. This concept was expanded upon by [[Sega|Sega's]] ''[[Comix Zone]]'' seven years later.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Leon|title=Batman - From Spectrum Beginnings To Arkham Origins|url=http://home.bt.com/games/games-features/batman-from-spectrum-beginnings-to-arkham-origins-11363843669417|website=BT.com|publisher=BT|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref>

A further notable feature was that the game was split into two independently playable parts in which Batman is faced with two of his most well-known adversaries: "A Bird In The Hand" featuring [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] and "A Fete Worse Than Death" which involved [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]. The gameplay involves Batman using punches and kicks and his [[batarang]] (a thrown weapon) in order to fight the villains' henchmen as well as solving puzzles.

''[[Your Sinclair]]'' magazine awarded it 9 out of 10,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Berkmann |first=Marcus |date=January 1989 |title=''Batman: The Caped Crusader'' review |journal=Your Sinclair |issue=37 |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/batmancc.htm |access-date=2007-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027051816/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/batmancc.htm |archive-date=2007-10-27 |url-status=dead}}</ref> praising the colourful and expressive graphics and the inclusion of two separate adventures. ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' also gave a positive review, praising the graphics, particularly the Atari ST's graphics over the C64's, but noted that the game emphasises mazes and puzzles over beating up bad guys, and as such did not quite meet expectations.<ref name = "CGW">{{citation | date = June 1989 | last = Wilson | first = David M. | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Caped Crusader Combats Crime | pages = 20â€“21 | issue=60}}</ref>
