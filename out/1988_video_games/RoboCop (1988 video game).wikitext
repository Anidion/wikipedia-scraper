The game was a critical and commercial success. The arcade game was the highest-grossing [[1988 in video games|arcade game of 1988]] in Hong Kong, and reached number-two on [[Video games in Japan|Japan]]'s monthly ''Game Machine'' arcade charts. On home computers, the game sold over {{nowrap|1 million}} copies worldwide, and it was especially successful in [[Video games in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] where it was the best-selling [[home computer game]] of [[1980s in video games|the 1980s]].

The gameplay is similar to Data East's arcade game ''[[Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja]]'', released earlier the same year.<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action: RoboCop |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=November 1988 |issue=86 (December 1988) |pages=149–52 |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-086/page/n148}}</ref> ''Robocop'' includes elements from both [[beat 'em up]] and [[run and gun video game]]s.

== Release ==
In 1988, Ocean adapted Data East's ''Robocop'' arcade game for 8-bit home computers, converting much of the arcade game while also adding original content to make it different from the arcade original.<ref name="RG46" /> This version was produced for the [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[TRS-80 Color Computer#Color Computer 3 (1986–1991)|TRS-80 Color Computer 3]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[MS-DOS]], meaning that home computers ended up with two different versions of ''Robocop'' for North American and European audiences.

Ports for the [[Apple II]], [[Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]]; ports for DOS, [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], and TRS-80 Color Computer 3 followed in 1989. The Apple II and IBM PC ports were developed by Quicksilver Software, while the Amiga and Atari ST versions were developed directly by Ocean. The NES version was developed primarily by Data East with programming handled by Sakata SAS Co, and Ocean ported and published a version for the [[Game Boy]] in 1990. A port of the game for the Atari Jaguar was planned but never released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaysmith2000.com/|title=Atari Jaguar Sector II Forum Link|website=jaysmith2000.com|access-date=September 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202130245/http://www.jaysmith2000.com/|archive-date=December 2, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.janatari.de/atari-jaguar/jaguar-lost-games/|title=Atari Jaguar Lost Games|website=janatari.de|access-date=2018-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906052745/https://www.janatari.de/atari-jaguar/jaguar-lost-games/|archive-date=2018-09-06|url-status=live}}</ref>

The title theme of the Ocean Software versions (composed by Jonathan Dunn) has become well known for its serene, calm tune, which heavily contrasted the tone of both the actual game and the source material; the version of the theme heard in the Game Boy port was later licensed by European kitchen appliance company [[Indesit|Ariston]] for use in a series of TV adverts.<ref name="Robosong">{{cite news |last1=Person |first1=Chris |title=What do Robocop, Washing Machines, Dilbert & Lil B have in Common? |url=http://kotaku.com/5885431/what-do-robocop-washing-machines-dilbert--lil-b-have-in-common |access-date=October 25, 2016 |work=Kotaku |date=February 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026075359/http://kotaku.com/5885431/what-do-robocop-washing-machines-dilbert--lil-b-have-in-common |archive-date=2016-10-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> The song was also used as the theme song for [[Charlie Brooker]]'s documentary ''[[How Videogames Changed the World]]'',<ref>{{cite news |last1=Whitehead |first1=Dan |title=TV review: How Videogames Changed the World |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-05-tv-review-how-videogames-changed-the-world |access-date=October 25, 2016 |work=Eurogamer |date=December 5, 2013 |language=en-UK |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111155/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-05-tv-review-how-videogames-changed-the-world |archive-date=2016-10-25 |url-status=live }}</ref> and was one of Brooker's selections on [[Desert Island Discs]].
