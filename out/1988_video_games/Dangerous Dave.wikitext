'''''Dangerous Dave''''' is a 1988 [[computer game]] by [[John Romero]]. It was developed for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[DOS]] as an example game to accompany his article about his GraBASIC, an [[Applesoft BASIC]] add-on, for the [[UpTime (disk magazine)|''UpTime'' disk magazine]].

==Summary==
[[File:Dangerous Dave gameplay.png|left|thumb|The [[Apple II series|Apple II]] version of the original ''Dangerous Dave''.]]
The object of the game is to collect gold cups to move on to the next level. Since the original 1988 publishing of ''Dangerous Dave'' on UpTime, there have been three sequels and three [[porting|ports]] of the original to other platforms.

The idea for ''Dangerous Dave'' came to [[John Romero]] under the influence of ''[[Super Mario]]''. There are similarities between the two games, such as the secret levels, the level design, the monsters, and the jumping. According to Romero, he was "on purpose trying to make a ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' game".<ref>{{cite book|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|year=2016|title=Atari to Zelda: Japan's Videogames in Global Contexts|page=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tH3TCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA201|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=978-0262034395}}</ref> The mission is to guide Dave through ten levels, collecting trophies in the hideout of his enemy, Clyde. Romero says that among all ''Dangerous Dave'' sequels ''[[Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion]]'' is "the best Dave ever created".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rome.ro/article_saga_dave.htm |title=The Saga of Dangerous Dave |access-date=2004-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040605150703/http://www.rome.ro/article_saga_dave.htm |archive-date=2004-06-05 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2008 ''Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion'' was ported to [[cell phone]]s.<ref>[http://dave-mobile.com/ Cell phone version of ''Dangerous Dave''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404011409/http://dave-mobile.com/ |date=2008-04-04}} based on ''[[Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion]]''</ref>

==Post-Romero games==
===''Dangerous Dave's Risky Rescue''===
'''''Dangerous Dave's Risky Rescue''''' (known informally as '''''Dangerous Dave 3''''') was  published by [[Softdisk]] in 1993, and is the first ''Dangerous Dave'' game to not be programmed by [[John Romero]]. This is because he, [[John Carmack]], [[Adrian Carmack]] and [[Tom Hall]] had left Softdisk by this point to form [[id Software]]. It was followed by a sequel, ''Dave Goes Nutz!'', which shares similar gameplay elements.

Like the previous title, Dangerous Dave is on a mission to save his little brother Delbert, this time from the evil "Dr. Nemesis" (who is also the main antagonist in Softdisk's ''[[Catacomb (video game)|Catacomb]]'' franchise).

===''Dave Goes Nutz!''===
'''''Dave Goes Nutz!''''' (known informally as '''''Dangerous Dave 4''''') was published by [[Softdisk]] in 1993 for. It continues from ''Dangerous Dave's Risky Rescue'', where Dangerous Dave is on a mission to save his little brother Delbert, from the evil "Dr. Nemesis" (who is also the main antagonist in Softdisk's ''[[Catacomb (video game)|Catacomb]]'' franchise). The game takes place within a [[psychiatric hospital]] filled with zombies.

==Reception==
''Dangerous Dave's Risky Rescue'' was reviewed in 1993 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #200 by [[Sandy Petersen]] in the "Eye of the Monitor" column. Petersen gave the game 2 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon200">{{cite journal
