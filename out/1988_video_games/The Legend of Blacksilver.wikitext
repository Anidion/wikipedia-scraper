==Development==

''The Legend of Blacksilver'' uses an improved version of the [[game engine]] used in its predecessor, ''Legacy of the Ancients'', which in turn was loosely based on the engine used in the ''[[Questron]]'' series. The game is written in [[BASIC]] supplemented with a few disk, sound, and graphics routines coded in [[machine language]] for speed. Initially released for the [[Commodore 64]] it was later ported over to the [[Apple II]], and a full PC version was planned to release but never did.<ref name="ACE">{{cite news |last1=N/A |first1=N/A |title=Legend of Blacksliver: EPYX/ US Gold summon the boel roots |url=https://archive.org/details/ace-magazine-18/page/n95/mode/2up?view=theater |access-date=2 April 2024 |agency=Game Information |issue=18 |publisher=Advanced Computer Entertainment |date=March 1989 |ref=p 96}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

The game is mainly played in a top down style that sees the character moving through various environments within the world. while mainly sticking to the top down style within towns, citadels, dungeons, temples, etc. It moves into a faux 3D style when the player enters dungeon. It features a turn based style of combat when it comes to confronting enemies as well as NPC interaction. With the game being entirely turn based if the player decides to sit still turns will pass them by every few seconds. When encountering monsters players will find themselves with four options, those being attacking, talking, stalking, or waiting. This however does not transfer over to Dungeons as every monster you encounter within them is immediately hostile towards the player. The player does not gain experience through combat but has access to the ability to upgrade attributes such as armor, rank, or beating game masters in temples. The player has the ability to purchase spells in different towns though some may have a level requirement. The player also has a multitude of ways to gain money in the game such as fighting monsters, finding treasure, robbing merchants, looting temples, gambling, and odd jobs.<ref name="LoB User manuel story">{{cite book |first1=Epyx|last1=N/A |title=The Legend of Blacksilver - C64/Apple II/IBM Manual |date=1988 |publisher=Epyx |location=Meriden, Coventry, United Kingdom |page=1 |edition=1st |url=https://openretro.org/file/bf4ed5f254c60be84054fd95478d32d0f37d2ff3/Manual%20%28en%29.pdf |access-date=2 April 2024 |ref=1}}</ref>
