Richard C. Leinecker, reviewing the PC DOS version of the game for ''[[Compute!]]'' magazine, noted that the game suffered from poor documentation containing numerous errors. The documentation also only explained how to use a joystick, although the game can be played with a keyboard. He also found mistakes in the programming such as the character sprite appearing out of position, either just above or below ledges and objects in the game. He speculated that the sloppy programming may be a consequence of trying to keep costs down for a budget title.<ref name="comp"/>
