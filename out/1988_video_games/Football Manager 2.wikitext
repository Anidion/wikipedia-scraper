'''''Football Manager 2''''' is the second game in the ''[[Football Manager (1982 series)|Football Manager]]'' series.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay is very similar to the first game, with mostly text based screens (although they are more colorful than the original and usually contain at least basic graphical elements). Input is mostly by moving a cursor (using either [[joystick]] or [[Computer mouse|mouse]] depending on system), rather than entering numbers. The game again starts the player, whichever team is chosen, in division four with a random allocation of players and the player must attempt to gain promotion to division one but now, as well as the FA Cup, the player can also compete in the [[League Cup]] so eventually attempt to win the [[Treble (association football)|treble]].

Added features include team sponsorship, a training screen which allows the choice of long or short passing tactics and the ability to place your players in positions on the pitch. This is done by moving boxes representing your players on a graphical screen while comparing individual opponent players' skills (although, like the first game, the opposing players are not named). This means opposing strikers can be [[man marking|man marked]]. Another main difference to the first game is the graphical highlights, now on all versions, that now feature the full length of the pitch over three screens rather than just the goal attempts. Also, at half time, substitutions and formation changes can be made.

==Development and release==
Following the sale of Addictive Games to [[Prism Leisure Corporation]] in 1987, Kevin Toms concentrated on creating a second ''Football Manager'' game.<ref name="denofgeek">[https://www.denofgeek.com/games/69875/the_den_of_geek_interview_kevin_toms.html "Interview: Kevin Toms"], Simon Brew, Den of Geek, June 2008</ref> Unlike the original BASIC only game, the sequel required [[machine code]] which meant working with a number of developers for various systems.<ref name="denofgeek" /> For the ZX Spectrum version, this was Bedrock Software.<ref name="bedrock">[http://www.bedrock-software.com/fm2.htm ''Football Manager 2''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042210/http://www.bedrock-software.com/fm2.htm |date=2016-03-04 }} at Bedrock Software</ref> Unlike the first game that was stagger-released over a period of 5 years, ''Football Manager 2'' was launched on all formats at the same time in June 1988, although it was available on a much smaller range of systems - Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari ST and PC.<ref name="fm2 ad" />

Unlike the first game, there was no customiser utility with the original release but in 1989, ''Football Manager 2 Expansion Kit'' was released, both as a stand alone release<ref name="fm2ek wos">[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001829 ''Football Manager 2 Expansion Kit''] at World of Spectrum</ref> and packed in with ''Football Manager 2''.<ref name="fm2&fm2ek wos">[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0012574 ''Football Manager 2 + FM2 Expansion Kit''] at World of Spectrum</ref> As well as being able to rename teams and players, this offered the chance to start in division one or play in other leagues such as the 'Euro Super League' or as a national team in a 'World Championship'.

==Reception==
Critical reception was generally positive, although there were mixed reviews. In a highly positive review, based mainly on the ST version, Julian Rignall in ''[[Computer and Video Games|C&VG]]'' said the game was "simply a football fan's dream come true. It's a beautifully structured and presented game and is engrossing, challenging and very, very addictive" awarding a score of 9/10.<ref name="c&vg fm2">[http://amr.abime.net/review_11581 ''Football Manager II'' review], Julian Rignall, [[C&VG]], Issue 81, July 1988</ref> Sinclair User were similarly impressed, giving a score of 94% concluding that it is "an improvement on a legendary game. It still looks tatty but plays brilliantly".<ref name="su fm2">[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue076/Pages/SinclairUser07600097.jpg ''Football Manager 2'' review], Graham Taylor, [[Sinclair User]], Issue 76, July 1988</ref> In contrast, Tony Dillon in a review for ''[[Commodore User]]'' gave the game only 2/10, labeling the game "a very big letdown" with "little or no improvement over the original".<ref name="cu fm2">[http://amr.abime.net/review_13048 ''Football Manager 2'' review], Tony Dillon, [[Commodore User]], August 1988</ref> Additionally he said the mouse control on the Amiga version was "appallingly bad" (a criticism also leveled in the positive C&VG review).<ref name="c&vg fm2" /><ref name="cu fm2" />

John S. Davison for ''[[Page 6]]'' said "I'm no football fan, but I actually enjoyed this game despite its failings. As with all good simulations I soon found myself totally absorbed by it, and the desire to play just one more match was very strong. If it does this to me, then football enthusiasts should love it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Page6-37-Apr89/page/64/mode/2up|title=Page6 37 Apr89|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Zzap!64|Zzap!]]'' said "There is sufficient depth, particularly in the training section, for your managerial skills to be honed, and varied, so lasting interest is quite high. Decision-makers, this game is for you."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/ZZap64Issue0421988Oct/page/n103/mode/2up|title=ZZap_64_Issue_042_1988_Oct|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' said "Real football fans everywhere will love it; it may not have mass appeal, but it's a leader in its field."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Crash_No._54_1988-07_Newsfield_GB/page/n19/mode/2up|title=Crash - No. 54 (1988-07)(Newsfield)(GB)|date=July 26, 1988|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Andrew Baines for ''The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review'' said "The whole new look and feel of ''Football Manager 2'' gives the impression of a true winner, and definitely something you grow to enjoy more and more. This one receives the top spot out of all the others as a game that is essential for everyone, as it is a true classic."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Australian_Commodore_and_Amiga_Review_The_Volume_6_Issue_2_1989-02_Saturday_Magazine_AU/page/n31/mode/2up|title=Australian Commodore and Amiga Review, The - Volume 6 Issue 2 (1989-02)(Saturday Magazine)(AU)|date=February 26, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
