{{nihongo|'''''America Daitōryō Senkyo'''''|アメリカ大統領選挙|Amerika Daitōryō Senkyo|translated as ''United States Presidential Race'' on the manual and cartridge label and misspelled ''United State Presidential Race'' on the box|lead=yes}} is a [[government simulation game|government simulation]] [[video game]] released by [[Hect|Hector Playing Interface]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]]. It is loosely based on the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 election campaign]] for the [[president of the United States]] and features characters based on actual candidates and other politicians. The game was conceived and directed by Japanese CNN Daywatch newscaster  [[Shintaro Ito]], who would later become a politician himself.

==Gameplay==
At the start of the game, the player has four different issues to take either a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], or [[Centrism|centrist]] position on. The player must make wise use of his funds as he is trying to become the ''President of the United States of America''. Being liberal offends the [[Christian Coalition of America|religious folks]], being conservative offends the university students and [[working class]] [[Voting|voter]]s, and being centrist (as in pleasing everybody) actually pleases nobody. The player starts in February 1988 at a convention for his political party somewhere in the [[Midwestern United States]]. and must work his way up to the final election results on November 1988 without becoming [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://browserfamicom.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-64.html| title = Starting information | publisher = Browser Famicom |language=ja| date = | accessdate = 2012-11-09}}</ref>

In the presently unknown [[primary election]], candidates in five [[U.S. state|states]] (including players) make the final selection along with the decision-making. Opinion polls and election campaigns (speeches) do benefit the player in his presidential campaign. However, the primary elections in are not implemented in all states in the same way. Some states may be processed automatically by [[computer]] (a fixed number of delegate count) while others in a more manual way. The [[Super Tuesday]] primaries are to be held on the same day in many states, ballot counting is done after the player has made simultaneous attempts in each campaign state into three regions. After that, the primary election is made (not counting district units held, subject to the provisions of the delegate count.)

The priorities of the policies that the player can make were introduced to the game as the situation was in 1988 because of the Soviet Union and the [[CoCom]]. In 1991, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] would eventually lead to CoCom being disbanded in 1994. South Africa had an apartheid regime at the time and abolished in it 1991. The Panama Canal Zone was returned in 1999 to the people of [[Panama]]. However, it differs from the political situation encountered in the game. The "AIDS patient isolation" issue was showing an event of [[discrimination|discriminatory policy]] of an era that had not shown wide public awareness about how the AIDS virus manages to spread from person to person.

If the player manages to win the game and become President of the United States, the official Presidential Oath is displayed in [[English language|English]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www25.atwiki.jp/famicomall/pages/57.html| title = Ending information | publisher = FC no Game Seiha Shimasho |language=ja| date = | accessdate = 2012-11-09}}</ref>
