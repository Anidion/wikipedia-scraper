'''''Kings of the Beach''''' is a [[beach volleyball]] [[computer game]] released by [[Electronic Arts]] in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[MS-DOS]].<ref>{{moby game|id=/kings-of-the-beach}}</ref> A version for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] was produced by [[Konami]] (under the [[Ultra Games]] label) in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]].

The player can play as [[Sinjin Smith]] and [[Randy Stoklos]]. The game features three modes of play: practice, match play and tournament.  In the latter, you progress through five beaches ([[San Diego]], [[Chicago]], [[Waikiki]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], and [[Australia]]) filled with increasingly challenging opponents.  While Smith and Stoklos are joined by Ron Von Hagen, [[Tim Hovland]] and [[Mike Dodd]] as the only 'real' volleyball players featured in the game, EA spiced up the competition with some notorious characters from other games, including [[Hard Hat Mack]] and Lester from ''[[Skate or Die!|Skate or Die]]'' and ''[[Ski or Die]]''.

The gameplay controls for the console version are fairly simple, with the [[directional pad]] and two buttons doing all the work. In the PC version, players control three actions: bump, set, and block/spike. Diving for the ball occurs automatically. The only 'advanced' moves in the game are the ability to dink or perform a one-handed Kong block (Stoklos's trademark).

Another feature of the game is the ability to 'argue' calls with the referee, which occasionally allows players to get a point overturned.  However, if players argue too much, the referee may penalize them with a red card and deduct a point.
