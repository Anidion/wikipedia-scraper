'''''Air Warrior''''' was a [[Multiplayer online game|multiplayer]] online [[combat flight simulation game]] launched by [[Kesmai]] in 1987. It was hosted on [[GEnie]] and used that service as a server for client software running on a variety of [[personal computer]]s. It underwent continual improvement through its decade-long lifetime with Kesmai, appearing on new platforms and host services. [[Electronic Arts]] purchased Air Warrior in 1999, and became provider of the game, but it was discontinued in 2001. Sequels ''[[Air Warrior II]]'' and ''[[Air Warrior III]]'' were both released in 1997 and published by [[Interactive Magic]].

''Air Warrior'' was one of the first massive online games, hosting hundreds of users during busy periods. It inspired ''[[WarBirds]]'', which in turn inspired ''[[Aces High (video game)|Aces High]]'', while other members of the ''Warbirds'' team went on to produce ''[[World War II Online]]''. Today there are a number of similar games, like ''[[WarThunder]]'', most of them based on a [[freemium]] model.

==History==
Introduced in 1988 by [[Kesmai]],<ref name=Brooks>[http://home.comcast.net/~evanbrooks/20tha1.htm Brooks, M. Evan (2001)]</ref> ''Air Warrior'' was played over modems and hosted on the [[GEnie]] [[online service provider]]. Players could choose one of a number of [[World War II]] aircraft to fly, along with ground vehicles, and play in a multiplayer "arena" with hundreds of other players. The game focused mostly on [[dogfight]]ing, with a secondary strategic role of capturing forward airbases near the center of the map. Several updated versions were released, and additional service providers were added over time.

The original version of ''Air Warrior'' ran on [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]] computers, had simple black and white wireframe graphics, and cost over $10 per hour to play. Over time, Kesmai produced improved versions of the game, starting with [[SVGA]] ''Air Warrior'' in 1993, and continuing with ''Air Warrior'' for Windows in 1996, ''[[Air Warrior II]]'' in early 1997, ''[[Air Warrior III]]'' later in 1997, and finally ''Air Warrior III Millennium Version'' in 2000. Development of ''Air Warrior II'' was directly overseen by [[Bill Stealey]], founder of the game's publisher, [[Interactive Magic]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Interactive Magic |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=September 1996|pages=109–110}}</ref>

Kesmai also did business deals to provide access to ''Air Warrior'' through additional on-line services, including Delphi, CRIS, [[CompuServe]], [[America Online]], [[Earthlink]], Gamestorm and [[Compupress|CompuLink]]. A version of ''Air Warrior'' for Windows was ported back to the Macintosh in 1997 in an Internet open beta, and then later moved to America Online. In 1999, [[Electronic Arts]] purchased ''Air Warrior'', and became provider of the latest version of the game, only to discontinue it in 2001.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1990 called ''Air Warrior'' "the most exciting [wargame] I've played", warning players to "be resigned to spending some money on it, though, because ''time'' flies while ''you'' do".<ref name="archibald199001">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=67 | title=Lost in the Ozone Again / "Air Warrior" on GEnie | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=January 1990 | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | author=Archibald, Dale | pages=14 | issue=67}}</ref> 1991 and 1993 surveys in the magazine of strategy and war games gave it three and a half stars out of five.<ref name="brooks199111">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=88 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: The 1900-1950 Epoch / Part I (A-L) of an Annotated Paiktography | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1991 | accessdate=November 18, 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

The magazine suggested that if Kesmai were to add some upgrades to the offline single-player mode it would "blow away any of the competition".<ref name="fick199305">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=106 | title=SVGA Air Warrior | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=May 1993 | accessdate=July 7, 2014 | author=Fick, Doug | pages=98}}</ref> In a 1994 survey of wargames the magazine gave the title four stars out of five, noting its high cost but reporting that it was "continually being revised and updated".<ref name="brooks199401">{{Cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M.

In 1997 ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' named ''Air Warrior'' as number six on their "Top 10 Online Game Picks". They noted that ''Air Warrior'' provided a multiplayer flight sim online with a persistent environment.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Next Generation's Top 10 Online Game Picks |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=27|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=March 1997|page=42}}</ref>
