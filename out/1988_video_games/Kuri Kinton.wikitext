==Reception==
''Kuri Kinton'' has received a mixed response from reviewers and critics. ''[[Retrogames]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> staff member writing in a 2010 feature described the levels as bland, criticised the game's bosses for being effectively the same character with different colored clothes. Despite this, the reviewer stated "..there's something quite fun about the game that makes it difficult to put down..". ''Kung-Fu Master'' was suggested as a more readily accessible game with similar gameplay.<ref name="retro"/> ''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Andy Smith was more critical when writing in 1988. He stated "''Kuri Kinton''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s a dull game, the graphics aren't anything special and the game style's very old hat by today's standards."<ref name="ace"/> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> 1989 review was more positive, the reviewer praised the game's "..large sprites and well drawn graphics" and stated "''Kuri Kinton'' packs a hell of a punch and is far more playable than ''[[The Last Apostle]]''."<ref name="cvg"/>

As part of the ''Taito Legends 2'' compilation the game was described as "..fairly standard side-scrolling brawler fodder.." by ''[[Eurogamer]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Kristan Reed.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_taitolegends2_ps2| title = Taito Legends 2 PlayStation 2 Review| author = Reed, Kristan| publisher = [[Eurogamer]]| date = 2006-03-31| access-date = 2010-09-30}}</ref>
