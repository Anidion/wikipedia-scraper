==Reception==
Dennis Lynch for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said: "Twice burned, I was a little wary when I loaded up ''Star Trek: First Contact'' [...] But I got a pleasant surprise, Trekkies. The game is really quite good. ''First Contact'' has an intriguing plot."<ref>Lynch, Dennis (1988-10-14). "A 'Star Trek' game worthy of the name" (pages [https://web.archive.org/web/20240206083712/https://www.newspapers.com/article/chicago-tribune/140368095/ 1] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20240206083909/https://www.newspapers.com/article/chicago-tribune/140368109/ 2]).

[[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Primarily for beginning to average players, since advanced players will get through this one in an afternoon."<ref name="CGW52">{{cite magazine |author=Scorpia |authorlink=Scorpia (journalist) |title=The Enterprise Establishes "First Contact": The Latest "Star Trek" Adventure |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1988 |volume=1 |issue=52 |pages=16–17}}</ref>

Jeff Donahue for ''Home Office Computing'' said that "Trekkies will enjoy ''First Contact'' even though it falls short of its predecessor, Rebel Universe. It offers features we've come to expect from the Star Trek series (graphic depictions of key game elements and the ability to control crew members) in addition to new features such as the Captain’s auto-log and access to the Enterprise’s databanks."<ref>{{cite news |last=Donahue |first=Jeff |date=January 1989 |title=Star Trek: First Contact |url=https://archive.org/details/home-office-computing-january-1989/page/94/ |magazine=Home Office Computing |publisher=[[Scholastic Incorporated]] |via=[[Internet Archive]] |volume=7 |number=1 |page=94 |accessdate=2024-02-06 }}</ref> 

''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'' said that "Expanded options, better music and a set of fairly nice illustrations makes it a fuller play experience than ''Kobayashi Alternative''."<ref>{{cite news |date=September 1990 |title=Aboard the Enterprise |url=https://archive.org/details/video-games-computer-entertainment-september-1990/page/133/ |magazine=[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]] |via=[[Internet Archive]] |page=133 |accessdate=2024-02-06 }}</ref> ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'' later said that "This tangled tale of an encounter with an alien race incorporates an upgraded version of the ''Kobayashi'' play system and adds to it a nice set of illustrations."<ref>{{cite news |date=April 1991 |title=Games Beyond Tomorrow |url=https://archive.org/details/VGCE27Apr1991/page/n83/ |magazine=[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]] |via=[[Internet Archive]] |page=84 |accessdate=2024-02-06 }}</ref>
