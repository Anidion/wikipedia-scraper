{{nihongo foot|'''''Rastan Saga II''''',|ラスタンサーガ2|Rasutan Sāga Tsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} known in [[Europe]] as '''''Nastar''''' and in [[North America]] as '''''Nastar Warrior''''' (except for the North American [[Sega Genesis]] version, which was released as ''Rastan Saga II''), is a [[hack and slash]] [[Platform game|platform]] [[arcade video game]] developed and released by [[Taito]] in 1988. It is the sequel to ''[[Rastan (video game)|Rastan]]'' (released as ''Rastan Saga'' in Japan). The story in this game tells how Rastan got his titular name (meaning his real name is unknown) and saved a vast region called 'Rastania' from evil monsters known as "The Wicked Group." Rastania, the kingdom which Rastan saves in this game, subsequently becomes his kingdom to rule.

==Gameplay==
''Rastan Saga II'' is a side scrolling hack-and-slash-em-up where the player takes the role of a barbarian who tries to defeat an evil wizard. The controls of Rastan consist of an eight-way joystick, a button for attacking, and a button for jumping. Like the first installment, the player is able to swing Rastan's sword in multiple directions. By using the joystick in combination with either button, the player can determine the height of Rastan's jumps.

There are a total six rounds, each consisting of two areas: an outdoor scene, and a castle hall where the player must confront the stage's boss. The backgrounds of the outdoor areas feature broad landscapes with changing sunlight effects with detail. The game's bosses include [[Medusa]], a [[Gladiator]] [[Centaur]], and the final boss, the evil wizard.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Rastan Saga II'' on their May 15, 1989 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=356|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 May 1989|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>

Retrospective opinions have been mixed to negative. Chris Rasa of [[Hardcore Gaming 101]] called the game "a huge step down from the original", with completely linear and "banal" level design, and poorly animated sprites.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rasa |first1=Chris |title=Rastan Saga II |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/rastan-saga-ii/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=15 January 2024}}</ref> Ken Horowitz of Sega-16 rated the Genesis version a 5 out of 10, calling it a "decent hack-'n-slash" that is "fun enough to spend an afternoon or two with." However he lamented the removal of 2-player mode and the poor audio quality when compared to the arcade.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=Genesis Reviews: Rastan Saga II |url=https://www.sega-16.com/2008/06/rastan-saga-ii/ |website=Sega-16 |access-date=15 January 2024}}</ref> Mark Bussler of [[Classic Game Room]] said the Genesis version has "painful, terrible music, and the visuals are just laughable", and criticized the level design as "mindless."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bussler |first1=Mark |title=Classic Game Room - Rastan Saga II review for Sega Genesis |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60QSHo69Yw0 |website=YouTube |access-date=15 January 2024}}</ref>
