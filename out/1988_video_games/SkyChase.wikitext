[[Julian Rignall]] of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' compared the game negatively to other flight simulators of the time: ''"Although Sky Chase has an impressive front end, the game itself is very simplistic, and plays similarly to [[Ocean Software|Ocean]]'s failed [[Top Gun (1986 video game)|Top Gun Licence]]; it pales in comparison with Cascade's [[Ace 2 (video game)|Ace II]]. There's little difference between the planes, and the gameplay is very repetitive."''<ref name="cvg"/>

[[Gary Whitta]] of ''[[Commodore User]]'' summarized: ''"[...] I would only advise you to consider buying Skychase if you have a chum to play it with. The computer mode is boring, too easy, and ultimately a drag to play."''<ref name="cuser"/>

''[[Zzap!64]]'' concluded that the game is ''"An exhilarating flying game - at its best with two players at the controls."''<ref name="zzap"/>
