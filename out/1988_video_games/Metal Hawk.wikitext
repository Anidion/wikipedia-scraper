{{nihongo foot|'''''Metal Hawk'''''|メタルホーク|Metaru Hōku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1988 [[multidirectional shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Namco]]. Assuming control of the titular attack helicopter, the player is tasked with using a machine gun and air-to-surface missiles to destroy enemies and earn a certain number of points before the timer runs out, all while avoiding collision with ether enemy projectiles and obstacles. The Metal Hawk can change its altitude to allow it to either rise higher in the air or lower towards the ground. It runs on the [[Namco System 2]] arcade board.

''Metal Hawk'' was one of the first games to be developed under Namco's then-new research and development (R&D) video game division in Japan. The development staff focused on creating a game that was both fun to play and exhilarating, and one with powerful, impressive hardware capabilities, specifically in its [[motion simulator]] [[arcade cabinet]]. [[Shinji Hosoe]] composed the game's soundtrack with assistance from Kazuo Noguchi; early versions had additional sound and instrument channels with a more upbeat vibe; these channels had to be removed later on due to a lack of hardware space. Japanese voice actress [[Maya Okamoto]] served as the voice of the operator, which provides commentary during levels.

''Metal Hawk'' was produced in limited quantities due to production costs regarding the cabinet; despite this, it proved to be a commercial success, and remained one of the most popular arcade games at the time. Critics commended the game for its fast-paced gameplay, impressive graphics and immersive arcade cabinet, with one critic labeling it was Namco's next "blockbuster" video game. Several have also compared the game heavily to Sega's ''[[Thunder Blade]]'', with many finding ''Metal Hawk'' to be superior. A home port of the game for the [[Sega CD]] was rumored to be in development but later cancelled.

''Metal Hawk'' is a multi-directional shooter video game, described as a cross between Namco's own ''[[Assault (1988 video game)|Assault]]'' and Sega's ''[[Thunder Blade]]''.<ref name="SUser"/> Assuming control of the titular attack helicopter, the player is tasked with scoring a certain number of points in each level before the countdown timer runs out. Gameplay involves shooting down enemies and avoiding collision with either their projectiles or the ground below. The Metal Hawk is equipped with a machine gun for destroying air-based enemies and air-to-surface missiles for destroying ground-based enemies. Enemies awards points when destroyed, and earning the required number of points will allow the player to progress to the next level. An arrow icon will point in the direction of the nearest enemy. The Metal Hawk can change its altitude via a throttle lever attached to the arcade cabinet, allowing it to either rise higher into the air or lower towards the ground, which is used for destroying air and ground-based enemies. The map rotates around the player, who remains in the center of the screen at all times, a concept previously used in ''Assault''.

By the mid-1980s, Japanese video game developer [[Namco]] quickly rose to become one of Japan's leading video game developers, creating hit titles such as ''[[The Tower of Druaga]]'' (1984), ''[[Pac-Land]]'' (1984), ''[[Metro-Cross]]'' (1985) and ''[[Rolling Thunder (video game)|Rolling Thunder]]'' (1986).<ref name="Edge">{{cite news |author1=Edge Staff |title=Namco: Leader of the Pac |url=https://archive.org/details/Edge_UK_008/page/n53/mode/2up/search/metal+hawk?q=metal+hawk |accessdate=9 February 2020 |agency=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge UK]] |issue=8 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=May 1994 |location=United Kingdom |pages=54–61}}</ref> The success of these titles generated a lot of income for the company, who began to set up a new research and development (R&D) division for future hardware endeavors, aiming to help create unique, interesting new coin-op games.<ref name="Edge"/> ''Metal Hawk'' was one of the first games produced under this new division, alongside ''[[Assault (1988 video game)|Assault]]'' (1988).<ref name="Edge"/> It was produced for the [[Namco System 2]] arcade system, which also powered titles such as ''[[Burning Force]]'', ''[[Valkyrie no Densetsu]]'', ''[[Finest Hour (video game)|Finest Hour]]'' and ''[[Cosmo Gang the Video]]''.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web |title=Metal Hawk - Videogame by Namco |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8673 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=9 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105063115/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8673 |archivedate=5 January 2020}}</ref>

When designing the game, Namco primarily focused on the game's technological capabilities; most notable of these is the arcade cabinet, a motion-based machine that rocked back and forth based on the player's actions in the game.<ref name="Ayumi">{{cite web |title=NAMCO ARCHIVES AYUMI - エレメカセンター |url=http://www.bandainamcogames.co.jp/gallery/ayumi/archive/elemecha/index.html |publisher=[[Namco]] |accessdate=9 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619113056/https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/gallery/ayumi/archive/elemecha/index.html |archivedate=19 June 2018 |date=June 2005}}</ref> Production documents also heavily focused on the game's controls, specifically its analogue joystick, which was to help make sure the controls themselves were smooth, responsive, and easy-to-use for players.<ref name="Ayumi"/> The development staff also made sure the gameplay itself was intense and fun to play, instead of being overshadowed by the hardware itself.<ref name="Ayumi"/>
