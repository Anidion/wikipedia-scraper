'''''Laser Squad''''' is a [[turn-based tactics]] video game, originally released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and later for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]], [[Amiga]], [[Sharp MZ|Sharp MZ-800]] and [[Atari ST]] and PC computers between 1988 and 1992. It was designed by [[Julian Gollop]] and his team at Target Games (later [[Mythos Games]] and [[Codo Technologies]]) and published by Blade Software,<ref name=Edge>{{cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/making-x-com-enemy-unknown |author=Edge Staff |date=2009-05-15 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |publisher=nex-gen.biz |title=The Making of: X-COM: Enemy Unknown |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026175106/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/making-x-com-enemy-unknown |archivedate=2011-10-26 }}</ref> expanding on the ideas applied in their earlier ''[[Rebelstar]]'' series. ''Laser Squad'' originally came with five mission scenarios, with an expansion pack released for the [[8-bit]] versions, containing a further two scenarios. 

Reaction from gaming magazines was positive, gaining it high review rating and several accolades. The legacy of the game can be seen in other titles like the ''[[X-COM]]'' series, especially the acclaimed ''[[X-COM: UFO Defense]]'' which was also created by Julian Gollop and was initially conceived as a sequel to ''Laser Squad''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:ZX Laser Squad.png|thumb|[[ZX Spectrum]] screenshot|left]]

''Laser Squad'' is a [[turn-based tactics]] war game where the player completes objectives such as rescue or retrieval operations, or simply eliminating all of the enemy by taking advantage of cover, squad level military tactics, and careful use of weaponry. The squad's team members are maneuvered around a map one at a time, taking actions such as move, turn, shoot, pick up and so on that use up the unit's [[action points]]. More heavily laden units may tire more easily, and may have to rest to avoid running out of action points more quickly in subsequent turns. Morale also plays a factor; a unit witnessing the deaths of his teammates can panic and run out of the player's control.

The original Target Games 8-bit release came with the first three missions with an expansion pack offered via mail order for the next two. The subsequent Blade Software 8-bit release included these as standard; the mail order expansion pack now offered was for missions six and seven instead. Both offers covered cassette and floppy disk versions. As well as featuring new scenarios, the expansion packs included additional weapons as part of the scenarios.

Including the expansion pack, there are seven scenarios in total, each one with its own difficulty settings and squad allocation: {{clear left}}

*"The Assassins" - The mission's objective is to assassinate weapons manufacturer Sterner Regnix. The player will lead a small squad of troops on an infiltration mission, dealing with droid patrols.
*"Moonbase Assault" - A small squad must penetrate the Omni Corporation moon base, via the airlocks, and destroy their computer systems.
*"Rescue from the Mines" - After a routine mission goes badly wrong, three members of a squad are held prisoner in the Metallix Corp mines. A squad of troops must negotiate the mine complex, free all three prisoners and escape.
*"The Cyber Hordes" - A small squad must defend a station from the attack of an advancing droid squad invasion. The base holds seven stabilizer cores vital to the planet's stability and the droids have focused their efforts on these targets.
*"Paradise Valley" - Following on from "The Cyber Hordes", the destruction of the stabilizer cores has left the colony in ruins and assault ships hover above waiting for the time of attack. To prevent capture of the blueprints for an advanced starfighter, the data has been transferred onto a portable security device and a squad is given the task of escaping from the colony with the device.
*"The Stardrive" - A group of mercenaries have captured a stardrive controller. A squad must go to their hidden base and retrieve the device.
*"Laser Platoon" - A free for all deathmatch as equal teams are pitted against each other. Large (10-man) squads, with reinforcements arriving frequently, hunt down the equally equipped opposition.

==Legacy==
''Rebelstar'' and ''Laser Squad'' are among the earliest examples of turn-based unit-level wargame video games. In 1990, Mythos Games released a fantasy game ''[[Lords of Chaos (video game)|Lords of Chaos]]'', which had many similarities to ''Laser Squad'' but was a follow-up to Gollop's earlier ZX Spectrum game ''[[Chaos: The Battle of Wizards]]''. The ''Laser Squad'' franchise has been revived by Gollop's [[Codo Technologies]] in 2002 with the play-by-email game ''[[Laser Squad Nemesis]]'', although this departs from the turn-based action point system and does not have customizable weaponry.

Many of the ''Laser Squad'' mechanics were re-used in the later ''[[X-COM]]'' series of games, created also by Gollop and Mythos Games but published by [[MicroProse]]. Notably, the first ''X-COM'' game, ''[[X-COM: UFO Defense]]'', began its development as ''Laser Squad II''. Some of the name choices for characters and organizations in the games of Mythos and Codo are a thread connecting all the ''Laser Squad'' and ''Rebelstar'' games.<ref>Examples include the recurring character Corporal Jonlan and the arms manufacturer Marsec (Mars Security), which was also featured in ''[[X-COM: Apocalypse]]''.</ref> The cover art for ''[[XCOM: Enemy Unknown]]'', [[Firaxis Games]]' and [[2K Games]]' [[Video game remake|remake]] of ''X-COM: UFO Defense'', pays homage to ''Laser Squad''.
