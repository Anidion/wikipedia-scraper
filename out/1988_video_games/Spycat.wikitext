'''''Spycat: An Interactive Expos√© of M.I.4{{frac|1|2}}''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] for the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]], written by Peter Scott (under the [[pseudonym]] Dylan) and published by [[Superior Software]] in 1988. The game is a parody of the scandal surrounding the ''[[Spycatcher]]'' book.

==Gameplay==

''Spycat'' is loosely based on the then current scandal surrounding the release of ''Spycatcher'', the memoirs of former [[MI5]] officer and Assistant Director [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]]. The player takes the role of the Spycat, Peter Correct, who has worked for M.I.4{{frac|1|2}} for fifty years but finds out he is to be forced to retire with a low [[pension]]. The player must collect classified research documents (among other items), then flee to Greenland to write his memoirs. Other characters found in the game include Sir Clive Amstrad (an amalgamation of [[Clive Sinclair]] and [[Alan Sugar]]) as technical expert "Q" and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] Margo Thatch ([[Margaret Thatcher]]).<ref>Original instructions, Superior Software</ref>

The game takes the form of an arcade adventure with the player moving through a series of locations and rooms, collecting and using items to progress. The player must avoid [[CCTV]] cameras and "Q"'s electronic devices that will drain Spycat's energy. The actions in the game (e.g. picking up and using items, opening doors) are controlled using an [[Computer icon|icon]] panel at the top of the screen.

==Development and release==
Author Peter Scott completed the game while still under exclusive contract to [[Audiogenic]]. Unhappy with their promotion of his games, he offered ''Spycat'' to Superior Software who wanted to publish it. Scott needed to give twelve months notice to get out of the deal with Audiogenic so ''Spycat'' (and other games he released in 1988) had to be credited only to the pseudonym Dylan.<ref name="scott">[http://www.beebgames.com/psinterv.php Interview with Peter Scott], Crispin Boylan, The BBC Games Archive</ref> It became the first of ten full price games Scott created for Superior between 1988 and 1990.

The game was released in 1988 by Superior Software on [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro as well as 5.25" [[floppy disk]] for the BBC Micro and 3.5" disk for the [[BBC Master#Master Compact|Master Compact]].

==Reception==
''[[Electron User]]'' gave the game an overall score of 7/10 with reviewer Chris Nixon finding the icon control panel "tiresome" and "unwieldy" but this is his "only complaint in an otherwise excellent game". He concludes: "''Spycat'' is an excellent arcade adventure with a strong vein of humour underlying all the action".<ref name="electron user">[http://8bs.com/elecgame/spycat.htm "Spy Spoof"], Electron User #5.9, June 1988</ref>

==Legacy==
''Spycat'' was included on the ''Play It Again Sam 9'' compilation in 1989 and was reissued as part of the Superior / [[Blue Ribbon (software house)|Blue Ribbon]] budget range in 1990.
