'''''Final Blow''''' is a [[boxing]] [[arcade video game]] released in 1988 by [[Taito]]. The name remained the same for all ported platforms, except for the [[Sega Genesis]] versions, which Sega released outside Japan as '''''James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing''''' featuring [[Buster Douglas]] himself in 1990 immediately after his upset victory over [[Mike Tyson]].

==Plot==
The game follows a single season boxing championship run. There are five fictional fighters competing: Dynamite Joe - The Miracle Fighter, Fernando Gomez - The South American Eagle, Kim Nang - The Korean Comet, King Jason - The Black King, and The Detroit Kid - The Invincible Black Panther.

==Gameplay==
The game is a side-scrolling boxing game where the player moves left and right to control a screen sized boxer. When the timing is right, the player can unleash a final blow punch which can sometimes [[Knockout|KO]] the opponent in a single strike.

The home versions contain a spectator mode where the player can watch their favorite boxers compete.

The Sega Genesis port adds two boxers: James Buster Douglas (who uses The Detroit Kid's graphics, slightly edited and [[palette swap]]ped) and Ironhead. It was one of the games used as part of the [[Genesis does what Nintendon't|Genesis Does Campaign]], particularly since Nintendo used Mike Tyson for its ''[[Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!]]'' video game, whom Douglas had challenged and defeated that year.
