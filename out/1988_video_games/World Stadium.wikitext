'''''World Stadium''''' (full title: {{nihongo foot|'''Pro Yakyū World Stadium'''|プロ野球ワールドスタジアム|Puro Yakyū Wārudo Sutajiamu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}), is a series of [[baseball]] [[arcade game]]s that were released by [[Namco]] in the late 1980s and 1990s; they were spin-offs of the ''[[Family Stadium]]'' franchise, inspired by the 1986 [[Famicom]] game ''[[Pro Yakyū Family Stadium]]'', and its sequel ''Pro Yakyū Family Stadium '87''. Except for ''Great Sluggers '94'', which was also released in America, all of the games were exclusive to Japan.

==Namco System 1 era (1988–90)==
The first three titles in the series, {{nihongo foot|'''''World Stadium'''''|ワールドスタジアム|Wārudo Sutajiamu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (1988), {{nihongo foot|'''''World Stadium '89 Kaimakuban'''''|ワールドスタジアム'89開幕版|Wārudo Sutajiamu '89 Kaimakuban|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (1989), and {{nihongo foot|'''''World Stadium '90'''''|ワールドスタジアム'90|Wārudo Sutajiamu '90|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (1990) all ran on [[Namco System 1]] hardware, and featured twelve teams from the "Urban League" (the Giants, Cars, Drasans, Sparrows, Wheels, and Titans), and "Country League" (the Lionels, Bravos, Hornets, Fires, Orients, and Buckaroos); they also featured three stadiums for matches to take place in ([[Korakuen Stadium|Kōrakuen]], [[Koshien Stadium|Kōshien]] and Mejā). The first two of these stadiums' scoreboards had clocks which started at 6:00 and advanced as the matches progressed (but broke at midnight), and the third stadium's scoreboard also featured the logo of Namco's [[United States]] distributor of that time period - [[Atari Games]].

''World Stadium'' was Japan's second highest-grossing [[1988 in video games|arcade game of 1988]].<ref>{{cite magazine|date=December 27, 1988|script-title=ja:第２回ゲーメスト大賞 〜 年間ヒットゲームベスト100|trans-title=2nd Gamest Awards – Best 100 Hit Games of the Year|url=https://archive.org/details/gamest0029/page/n44|magazine=[[Gamest]]|language=ja|volume=29 (February 1989)|pages=25–41 (41)|title=Gamest 0029 }} [http://www.netlaputa.ne.jp/~dummy/gamest/magazine/gamest/v029.html alternate url]</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '88 ''/ "Game of the Year '88" By Game Machine'' |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=348 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=15 January 1989 |pages=10–1, 26 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19890115p.pdf#page=6}}</ref> It went on to be Japan's seventh highest-grossing arcade [[1991 in video games|conversion kit of 1991]].<ref name="GM419">{{cite magazine |title="Final Fight II" and "Final Lap 2" Top Videos: Video Games of The Year '91 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=419 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=1 February 1992 |page=26 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19920201p.pdf#page=14}}</ref>

==Namco System 2 era (1991–93)==
The next four titles in the series, {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム|Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (1991), {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium '92'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム'92|Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu '92|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (1992), {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium '92 Gekitōban'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム'92激闘版|Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu '92 Gekitōban|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (1992), and {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium '93 Gekitōhen'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム'93激闘編|Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu '93 Gekitōhen|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} all ran on [[Namco System 2]] hardware; the first of these featured sixteen teams (the Lionels, Buckaroos, Fires, Orients, Giants, Cars, Wheels, Drasans, Sparrows, and Titans from the first three titles, as well as six new teams: the Blue Arrows, Homes, Orbies, Fifties, Nationals, and Americans), but the other three featured the twelve (real-life) teams from the Japanese Central and Pacific Baseball Leagues (the [[Seibu Lions]], [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]], [[Orix BlueWave]], [[Nippon-Ham Fighters]], [[Fukuoka Daiei Hawks]], and [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] of the Central League, and the [[Hiroshima Toyo Carp]], [[Chunichi Dragons]], [[Yakult Swallows]], [[Yomiuri Giants]], [[Yokohama Taiyo Whales]] (later the Yokohama DeNA Baystars), and [[Hanshin Tigers]] of the Pacific League).<ref>[http://www22.atpages.jp/nbgisub/sws.html スーパーワールドスタジアム'92激闘版 / '93激闘編]</ref> They also featured four stadiums for matches to take place in (Dome, Kōshien from the first three titles, Seaside and Manhattan) - again, the first three stadiums' scoreboards had clocks upon them (the third was digital), but they were broken (and the first two were stuck at 6:00, while the third just displayed the colon between the numbers). ''SWS '92 G'' also introduced a "FAVOR" setting in its options menu.

==Namco NB-1 era (1993–97)==
The next arcade baseball game Namco released was ''Great Sluggers: New World Stadium'' in 1993. It was the first to run on [[Namco NB-1]] hardware, and featured the 12 teams from Nippon Professional Baseball. A sequel was also released in 1994, titled ''Great Sluggers '94'' in Japan and ''Great Sluggers: Featuring 1994 Team Rosters'' in America. The Japanese version featured Nippon Professional Baseball teams, and the American version featured Major League Baseball teams. The next three titles in the series, {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium '95'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム'95|Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu '95|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium '96'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム'96|Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu '96|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, and {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium '97'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム'97||Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu '97|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} and featured the twelve real-life teams from the three previous games; they also featured six stadiums for their matches to take place in (Hillside, Trad, Urban, Kaihei Dome, Air Dome, and Seaside from the last four games). ''SWS '96'' also introduced five "optional ball clubs" - the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties, Nineties and USA, while the Urban Stadium was merely the Kōshien Stadium from the previous games renamed.

==Namco System 12 era (1998–2001)==
The last four titles in the series, {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium '98'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム'98|Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu '98|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium '99'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム'99|Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu '99|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium 2000'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム2000|Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu 2000|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, and {{nihongo foot|'''''Super World Stadium 2001'''''|スーパーワールドスタジアム2001|Sūpā Wārudo Sutajiamu 2001|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} all ran on [[Namco System 12]] hardware, and featured eighteen teams (the twelve real-life teams from the last six games and the USA team from the last two, along with five new teams: the Central League All-Stars, Pacific League All-Stars, Namco All-Stars, Nikotama Gals, and User Team). It also featured twelve stadiums for its matches to take place in (Seaside from the last seven games and Hillside, Air Dome, Urban, Trad, and Kaihei Dome from the last three games - along with the new Bay Area, Owari Dome, Naniwa Dome, Forest, Setōchi, and Kasenjiki). The Namco All-Stars and Nikotama Gals feature twenty-three of Namco's most famous characters; however, the pitchers of the former team are merely named after five others.
