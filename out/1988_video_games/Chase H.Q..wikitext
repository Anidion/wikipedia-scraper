{{nihongo foot|'''''Chase H.Q.'''''|チェイスH.Q.||"Chase Headquarters"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[Vehicular combat game|vehicular combat]] [[racing game]], originally released as an [[arcade video game]] by [[Taito]] in 1988. It is sometimes seen as a spiritual successor to Taito's earlier ''[[Full Throttle (arcade game)|Full Throttle]]''. The player assumes the role of a [[police officer]] named Tony Gibson, member of the "Chase Special Investigation Department". Along with his partner, Raymond Broady, he must stop fleeing criminals in high-speed pursuits in a black [[Porsche 928]].

''Chase H.Q.'' was [[Porting|ported]] to many [[home computer]]s by [[Ocean Software]] in 1989, including versions for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]], [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]]. Taito produced versions for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (1989), [[Game Boy]] (1990), [[Master System]] (1990), [[TurboGrafx-16]] (1990), [[Game Gear]] (1991), and [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] (1996). It was released for [[PlayStation 2]] in Japan in 2007 as part of ''[[Taito Memories|Taito Memories II Volume 2]]''.

The game was a commercial success, becoming Japan's highest-grossing dedicated [[1989 in video games|arcade game of 1989]] while also becoming a hit overseas for arcades and home systems. The game was also well received by critics. It was followed by three arcade-based sequels: ''[[Special Criminal Investigation]]'' (1989), ''[[Super Chase: Criminal Termination]]'' (1992) and ''[[Chase H.Q. 2]]'' (2007). Two spin-offs were also released: ''Crime City'' (1989) and ''Quiz H.Q.'' (1990).

==Gameplay==
At the start of each level the player is informed who they are pursuing, a great distance away: They must apprehend the criminal before their time limit expires.<ref name="SatMag12">{{cite magazine |title=Taito Chase H.Q. Plus S.C.I.: Traffic Cops Take it to the Bad Guys!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=12 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1996|pages=28–29}}</ref> The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape. At some points during the game the road splits, and the correct turn must be taken, otherwise it will take longer to catch the criminal. When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested.

The game includes five levels.<ref name="SatMag12"/> Both the initial time limit to reach the criminal and the time extension to ram the criminal are 60, 65, or 70 seconds.

When Nancy at Chase HQ (at the start of every level) calls on the radio, the frequency is often between 144 and 148&nbsp;MHz. This is actually the [[2-meter band]] of amateur or [[ham radio]] frequencies.

Although superficially similar in technology to [[Sega]]'s ''[[Out Run]]'', ''Chase HQ'' features significant technical advancements over that title in the presentation of perspective, hills and track splits.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}}

Villains (for arcade versions):
:1. Ralph, the Idaho Slasher (White [[Lotus Esprit]])
:2. Carlos, the New York armed robber (Yellow [[Lamborghini Countach]])
:3. Chicago pushers (Silver [[Porsche 911]])
:4. L.A. kidnapper (Blue [[Ferrari 288 GTO]])
:5. Eastern Bloc Spy (Red [[Porsche 928]])

The last villain's car is always listed as unidentified.

If the level is completed, bonus points are as follows: if completed without continuing, 100,000 times level in play, otherwise, 10,000; plus, 5,000 per second saved for completing level. A 5,000,000-point award is collected for beating the game.

==Ports and related releases==
[[Ocean Software|Ocean]] released versions of the game for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] in December 1989.<ref name="TGM25">''[[The Games Machine]]'', [http://amr.abime.net/issue_838_pages issue 25] (December 1989), pages 76-77</ref> The [[MSX]] version was released in February 1990 only in Spain, roughly one month later after the launch of the rest of Ocean's versions in that market.<ref name="MM12">''[[Micromanía]]'', issue 21, second period (February 1990), [https://archive.org/details/micromania-segunda-epocha-21/page/n53 page 55]</ref>

Taito produced ports (known as '''''Taito Chase H.Q.''''') for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (1989), [[Game Boy]] (1990/1991), [[Master System]] (1990), [[TurboGrafx-16]] (1990) and [[Game Gear]] (1991). It was released on the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] as '''''Chase H.Q. II''''' (known as '''Super H.Q.''' in Japan), with some minor changes, including alternative player vehicles.

In December 1990, the game was included on the '''''Wheels Of Fire''''' compilation, which also featured ''[[Hard Drivin]]'', ''[[Power Drift]]'' and ''[[Turbo OutRun]]'' on the commodore 64. In June 1991, the game was released on the '''''Power Up''''' compilation, which also featured also on the C64 ''[[Altered Beast]]'', ''[[Turrican]]'', ''[[Rainbow Islands]]'' and ''[[X-Out (video game)|X-Out]]''.

In 1991, the game was released for the [[FM Towns]].

In 1993, Taito released ''Super Chase H.Q.'' (known in Japan as ''Super H.Q. Criminal Chaser'') for the Super NES. Unlike other home versions, it is played in first person perspective and is based upon ''Super Chase: Criminal Termination'' rather than the original ''Chase H.Q.'' Gameplay is modeled on the original with some aspects of ''S.C.I.'' incorporated. A PAL version of ''Super Chase H.Q.'' was released exclusively in Australia in 1993 by [[Mattel]] (Nintendo's ANZ distributor until 1994) and re-released by Nintendo Australia thereafter. There is also a ''Super Chase H.Q.'' for the [[Game Boy]], which was released exclusively in North America, in 1994. The game is similar to the Game Boy's ''Taito Chase H.Q.'' (1991).

In 1996, Taito released an emulation of the arcade original for the [[Sega Saturn]] in Japan, bundled together with ''Special Criminal Investigation'' on one disc.<ref name="SatMag12"/>

In 2000, ''[[Chase H.Q. Secret Police]]'' was released for the [[Game Boy Color]].

In July 2008, the TurboGrafx-16 version of the game was re-released on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]].<ref>{{cite news|title=One WiiWare Game and Two Virtual Console Games Added to Wii Shop Channel|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/pR2zkTa_ZHOwG8vdUHzaWP46cL2QgQso|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=28 July 2008|access-date=4 August 2008}}</ref>

A spin-off was released in 1989 titled ''Crime City''. The game play deviates from the traditional third-person driving and is instead a side scrolling type shooter.

===Critical===
The arcade game was very well received by critics. ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave it a positive review, stating "at last" a "racing game with something more to do than just whizzing around a track to beat the course time".

The home computer conversions were also mostly well received by critics. The 16-bit Amiga and Atari ST versions received positive reviews, while the 8-bit ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC conversions received very high review scores and are generally recognised as the most accurate and most playable of the Ocean Software home computer releases. All three of the ZX Spectrum magazines awarded it 94% or above, praising the speed of the game and the originality. ''Crash'' gave the game 95%,<ref name="Crash"/> while ''[[Sinclair User]]'' awarded it 96%.<ref name="SUser-ZX"/> On the other hand, the 8-bit Commodore 64 conversion received a generally negative reception.<ref name="CVG100"/>

The Master System conversion was well received by critics. ''Computer and Video Games'' said the "gameplay is as exciting as it was in the arcades" and "the high-speed thrills of this conversion" makes this game worth to look at it.<ref name="CVG"/>

==Legacy==
''Chase H.Q.'' was successful enough to earn two arcade-based sequels - the widely released ''[[Special Criminal Investigation]]'' released in 1989 and the extremely rare ''Super Chase: Criminal Termination'' released in 1992. It also earned two spin-offs - the [[Shoot 'em up#Run and gun|run and gun]] ''Crime City'', and the [[quiz]] game ''Quiz H.Q.''.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

''[[Special Criminal Investigation]]'' expands on the original with the addition of guns - the passenger can rise out of the [[T-top]] of his [[Nissan 300ZX|Nissan 300ZX Z32]] and shoot at oncoming targets. To take advantage of this, enemies are placed throughout the level and will attempt to shoot at or ram the player as they attempt to pursue the main criminal. Deviating from the relatively realistic tracks on offer in the original, the sequel features pursuits through waterfalls and unfinished sections of elevated highway.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

''[[Super Chase: Criminal Termination]]'' was the third arcade release in the Chase H.Q. series, released in 1992.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The 1997 [[PlayStation]] game ''[[Ray Tracers]]'', developed and released by Taito, has been described as "more or less a follow up" to the game,<ref name="rtallgame">{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:7944~T1 |title=allgame (((Ray Tracers > Review))) |publisher=[[allgame]] |access-date=29 August 2008 |archive-date=1 December 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121201223057/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=7944 |url-status=dead}}</ref> with "only a few differences" such as a different speed-boost system and a greater variety of targets.<ref name="rtgamespot">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/driving/raytracers/review.html |title=Ray Tracers for PlayStation Review |website=[[GameSpot|GameSpot, Inc.]] |access-date=31 August 2008}}</ref>

[[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]] recorded a demo dance track called "Chase HQ" that was inspired by Chase H.Q. It includes samples of the "Oh man!" and "Punch the pedal!" exclamations from the game action. The track was released as a bonus track on the 2009 Deluxe reissue of the band's 1991 album, ''[[Foxbase Alpha]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

''Chase HQ''{{'}}s gameplay, which involved ramming the enemy car while avoiding oncoming traffic, has been cited as a precursor to the gameplay of later titles such as ''[[Driver (video game series)|Driver]]'' and ''[[Burnout (series)|Burnout]]''.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=The Video Games Guide: 1,000+ Arcade, Console and Computer Games, 1962-2012, 2d ed.|author=Fox, M.|date=2013|publisher=McFarland, Incorporated Publishers|isbn=9781476600673|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVc1QNGo_g0C&pg=PA49|page=49|access-date=4 October 2015}}</ref>
