'''''John Madden Football''''' is a football video game originally released for the [[Apple II]], in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]] following the success of ''[[Earl Weaver Baseball]]''. It was later ported to [[MS-DOS]] and the [[Commodore 64]]. It was followed by the 1990 [[Sega Genesis]] [[John Madden Football (1990 video game)|video game of same name]], and went on to become the yearly ''[[Madden NFL]]'' game series. It is sometimes called '''''Madden '88''''' or '''''Madden '89''''' to distinguish it from later games in the series.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Making of John Madden Football |url=https://pocketmags.com/eu/retro-gamer-magazine/issue-214/articles/882794/the-making-of-john-madden-football |website=pocketmags.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Carson |first=Dan |title=Ranking the Best Sports Toys from Your Childhood |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1787326-ranking-the-best-sports-toys-from-your-childhood |website=Bleacher Report}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=One Nation Under Madden How the Madden Video Game Franchise Became Bigger Than John Madden |url=https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2008/one-nation-under-madden-how-the-madden-video-game-franchise-became-bigger-than-john-madden |website=www.nielsen.com}}</ref>

This game features many customizable aspects including conditions, time of quarters, player fatigue, player injuries, and penalties. Unlike future ''Madden'' games, this version does not feature season play. It has only single games, and no actual NFL teams are included due to the lack of NFL or NFLPA licenses for authentic teams, player names, and stadiums. However, some teams are based on real teams. One could also create a team from scratch in this game. The cover was also used on All-Madden Edition of ''[[Madden NFL 23]]'' and was made by Chuck Styles.

==Development==
Inspired by [[Strat-O-Matic Football|Strat-O-Matic]] Sports simulator games, Trip Hawkins had long wanted to make a football game. [[Joe Montana]] and [[Joe Kapp]] were initially approached in 1982 to endorse it, but both refusedâ€”Montana was already working with Atari on a rival football game while Kapp proved to be outside of the company's budget. He eventually approached [[John Madden]] two years later and the company hatched out an agreement. Madden was interested in the prospect of the resulting project being used as a teaching tool.<ref name="SBNATION">{{Cite web |last=Brady |first=James |title=Exploring the (weird) story of the very first 'John Madden Football' game |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2018/8/7/17599240/john-madden-football-apple-ii-genesis-original-story-trip-hawkins |access-date=19 June 2020 |website=SB Nation|date=7 August 2018 }}</ref>

One sticking point for Madden was that 11 players had to be on each team, which was difficult due to technical limitations. EA had initially proposed that the game be played between two teams of six or seven, however Madden refused to endorse such a game. Due in part to this, as well as a legal issue involving [[Bethesda Softworks]]-whom EA hired to work on parts of the game, the development eventually took three years. At the time among the company the title became known as "Trip's Folly", with both employees of EA as well as Madden assuming that the game would be cancelled.<ref name="SBNATION" />

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' favorably reviewed ''John Madden Football'' for providing both a simple "Quick Mode" of arcade-like play, and a deeper "Standard Game" with detailed player statistics and user-created plays.<ref name="lee198904">{{Cite magazine |last=Lee |first=Wyatt |date=April 1989 |title=Computer Cavalcade of Sports |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1989&pub=2&id=58 |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |pages=45 |access-date=24 April 2016}}</ref>
