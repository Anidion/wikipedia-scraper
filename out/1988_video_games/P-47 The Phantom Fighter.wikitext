'''''P-47: The Phantom Fighter'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''P-47: The Freedom Fighter'''''|P-47: ザ・フリーダム・ファイター|''P-47: Za Furīdamu Faitā''||lead=yes}} in Japan and '''''P47 Thunderbolt''''' in Europe.}} is a [[1988 in video gaming|1988]] [[Shoot 'em up#Types|horizontally scrolling shooter]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] originally developed by [[NMK (company)|NMK]] and published by [[Jaleco]]. Set during [[World War II]], players control a [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] fighter aircraft to face against the Nazis, who are occupying multiple countries around the world. Its gameplay involves destroying waves of enemies, picking up power-ups and new weapons, and destroying bosses. It ran on the [[Mega System 1]] hardware.

''P-47: The Phantom Fighter'' was created by NMK as a game that celebrated the fight for freedom instead of war, with [[Video game composer|composer]] Sizlla Okamura not wanting the music being about horrors of war and leaned towards the concept of freedom being fun instead. First launched in arcades, the game was later ported to other platforms and has since been re-released through download services for modern platforms. A [[Video game conversion|conversion]] for the [[Sega Mega Drive]] was in development, however it did not receive an official release to the public. The title was met with mostly positive reception from critics and players alike, earning an award from ''[[Gamest]]'' magazine, however the home ports garnered mixed response from magazines, many of which also drew comparison with ''[[Silkworm (video game)|Silkworm]]''. A sequel, ''[[P-47 Aces]]'', was released in 1995.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC P-47 - The Phantom Fighter (P-47 - The Freedom Fighter).png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]

''P-47: The Phantom Fighter'' is a horizonal-scrolling shooter game reminiscent of ''[[Silkworm (video game)|Silkworm]]'', ''[[USAAF Mustang]]'', and ''Hacha Mecha Fighter''. Players control a Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft through eight stages that take place across multiple countries around the world, each with a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be defeated in order to progress further and face against the Nazis.

Some enemies carry icon-based power-up [[Item (gaming)|item]]s that can be picked to increase the aircraft's firepower such as bombs and missiles as well as a speed booster to increase mobility. Getting hit by enemy fire or colliding against solid stage obstacles will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the aircraft's firepower and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to [[Glossary of video game terms#Continue|continue]] playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty. In addition to the single-player mode, the game also features a two-player [[Cooperative video game|cooperative multiplayer]] mode.
