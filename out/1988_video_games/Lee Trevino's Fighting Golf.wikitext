{{nihongo|'''''Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf'''''|ファイティング ゴルフ|Faitingu Gorufu}} is a one to four-player [[arcade video game]] released by [[SNK]] in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], and later ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] that same year.

==Summary==
[[image:Fighting Golf Arcade.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]] 
The player can choose between four different golfers with varying advantages and disadvantages. [[Lee Trevino]] (who lent his endorsement to this North American NES version of the game) is playable (only in the North American version) as a character named Super Mex (an actual nickname of his; the Japanese version uses a character named Birdie Tommy in place of Trevino himself); other characters include Pretty Amy/Eri, Miracle Chosuke and Big Jumbo. Pretty Amy has limited range, but the easiest control ("control" refers to the length of the aiming guide). Miracle Chosuke and Super Mex have average attributes. Big Jumbo has the best range, but the worst control. Despite the title, no fighting is involved in the game. The player has to avoid [[bunker (golf)|sand trap]]s, [[water hazard]]s, rough ground and trees.

The courses range from relatively straightforward [[Golf course#Fairway and rough|fairways]] to elaborate arrangements of sand traps. The two courses available for play are the United States, which consists of mostly bunkers and super rough, and the Japan course, consisting of water and tight boundaries.  The United States course is modeled after PGA West Stadium Course.

At the end of the game, the player is greeted with a [[Unbiased rendering|photorealistic]] shot of the country club lodge against the setting sun and surrounded by trees.
