{{nihongo|'''''Psychic World'''''|サイキック・ワールド}} is an [[action game|action]] [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]]. Originally released in Japan for the [[MSX2]] as {{nihongo|'''''Psycho World'''''|サイコ・ワールド}} in 1988, it was later released as ''Psychic World'' on the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] worldwide in 1991.

==Gameplay==
''Psychic World'' is a platform game wherein the player's character Lucía runs from one stage to the other using her "ESP Booster" to blast monstrous enemies while obtaining item power-ups through them or by jumping on various ledges and platforms. The Booster has a gauge of how often certain items and abilities can be used, but that, as with her health, can be replenished by power-ups. All her weapons are upgradeable by merely picking up the same item for that particular weapon and new weapons are obtained through mini-[[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] and end-level bosses. The player has to use Lucia's psionic weapons strategically in levels using different elements to their advantage (in the ice stage, rocks being doused by falling water can be frozen and used as a stable platform for Lucía to jump on by blasting the rock with the ice shot, while the sonic wave weapon can destroy certain foreground objects blocking her path).

==Plot==
Taking place at a remote laboratory in the year 19XX, a three-staff research team consisting of Dr. Knavik and his assistants the TWIN sisters Cecile and Lucia is studying the exploration and usage of [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]]. One day while Lucia was getting ready for work, an explosion burst from the lab. By the time Lucia got there, Dr. Knavik was all right, but Cecile had disappeared. Dr. Knavik explains that part of his experiments involved running tests on a variety of monsters, but eventually the subjects rebelled and took Cecile with them. As Lucia follows the monster's track, Dr. Knavik gives her the ESP Booster, a device he created that will enable the user to wield psychic powers.
