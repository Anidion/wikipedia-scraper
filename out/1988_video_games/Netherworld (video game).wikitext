'''''Netherworld''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]] published by Hewson in 1988. It was originally developed by [[Jukka Tapanimäki]] for the [[Commodore 64]], and original music was composed by Jori Olkkonen.

==Summary==
The object is to fly a small spacecraft and collect the required number of diamonds in each level. Once enough diamonds are collected, the craft must reach a teleporter to go to the next level before the time runs out. Aside from the time limit, there are various obstacles, ranging from monsters to items which can damage the craft or block the path. The ship can destroy some obstacles by shooting, sometimes turning them to diamonds as well.
