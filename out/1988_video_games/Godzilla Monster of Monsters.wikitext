{{nihongo|'''''Godzilla: Monster of Monsters!'''''|ゴジラ}} is a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[video game]] released in Japan in 1988 and in 1989 in the US by [[Toho]] Co., Ltd. The North American version removes all references to [[Toho Cenfile-Soft Library]] and [[Compile (company)|Compile]], crediting the game to [[Toho Eizo]] on the title screen instead.

==Storyline==
In the year 2XXX, the mysterious Planet X appears when [[Pluto]] and [[Neptune]] switch positions in the [[Solar System|solar system]], and its inhabitants begin an attempt to conquer the [[Earth]], using a legion of space monsters (though some of these creatures were in fact from Earth) as their primary attack force. The King of Monsters, [[Godzilla]], joins forces with the guardian monster [[Mothra]] and the forces of Earth to repel the invasion forces.

==Gameplay==
[[File:GodzillaMonsterofMonstersOnMars.png|thumb|Mothra trying to defeat Manda, a monster that emerges from the Martian volcanoes.]]

The game features two playable monsters, [[Godzilla]] and [[Mothra]] (who originally appeared in her own [[Mothra (film)|movie]] and then later became a regular monster to fight alongside Godzilla). The player uses both monsters in turn by selecting the desired character on a virtual gameboard, representative of the planet it is on, and moving it like a [[chess piece]]. Each space is a [[hexagon]] that represents playable, side-scrolling [[level (computer and video games)|level]]s. There are rocky zones, jungle zones, city zones, and hyperspace zones. The hyperspace zones feature fights with the [[Matango]], [[Dogora]], and the ''[[The War in Space|Goten]]''. The alien space ships resemble the design of ''[[Atragon]]'' and ''[[The War in Space]]''.

Each board contains several monsters from the Godzilla series and some from other Toho movies and the objective is to clear each board of enemy monsters before advancing to the next board. Battles are fought when the player moves Godzilla or Mothra adjacent to an enemy monster, and are reminiscent of a match from a [[fighting game]]. The player plays a small side-scrolling level for each space advanced, and if one has moved adjacent to the monster, a battle follows the side-scrolling stages. More monsters appear on each stage until nearly every monster in the game is featured. When the player reaches Planet X, every previous monster is present along with King Ghidorah himself. The monster battles have a time limit of forty seconds but lack a countdown timer.

The monsters from the game (in order of confrontation and with their corresponding planets):

*[[Earth]]: ''Gezora'' - A giant squid or [[cuttlefish]]-like creature (originally from the 1970 movie ''[[Space Amoeba]]'')
*[[Earth]]: ''Moguera'' - A giant robot (originally from the 1957 movie ''[[The Mysterians]]'')
*[[Mars]]: ''[[Varan]]'' - A giant gliding lizard (originally from the 1958 movie ''[[Varan the Unbelievable]]'')
*[[Jupiter]]: ''[[Hedorah]]'' - A giant alien creature that feeds off of pollution (from the 1971 ''Godzilla'' movie ''[[Godzilla vs. Hedorah]]'')
*[[Saturn]]: ''[[Baragon]]'' - A fire-breathing dinosaur (originally from the 1965 movie ''[[Frankenstein Conquers the World]]'')
*[[Uranus]]: ''[[Gigan]]'' - A cyborg monster with blade arms (from the 1972 ''Godzilla'' movie ''[[Godzilla vs. Gigan]]'')
*[[Pluto]]: ''[[Mechagodzilla]]'' - A robotic replica of Godzilla (from the 1974 ''Godzilla'' movie ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'')
*Planet X: ''[[King Ghidorah]]'' - A giant three-headed dragon (from the 1964 ''Godzilla'' movie ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'')

The titular mushroom kaiju from the 1963 film ''[[Matango]]'' appear as mid-bosses throughout the early stages of the game. In later stages, that role goes to ''Gohten'', the space battleship from the 1977 sci-fi film ''[[The War in Space]]''.

In addition, ''[[Dogora]]'' from the 1964 film of the same name and the creature [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]] from the 1963 film ''[[Atragon]]'' appear as common enemies throughout the game.

==Sequels==
Later, a sequel was made called ''[[Godzilla 2: War of the Monsters]]''. The player controls the Army, trying to protect Japan from the ''Godzilla'' characters.

==In popular culture==
This game was the focus on a popular [[creepypasta]] titled "NES Godzilla Creepypasta", where a fan of the game ends up playing a twisted version of the game possessed by a vicious demonic entity called Red, a skeletal red monster who heavily distorts the game to hellish and unrealistic depths and has a history with the narrator's late girlfriend. The story is notable for also featuring a heavy amount of "screenshots" from the fictional version of the game. A [[fangame]] has been in development with a [[Game demo|demo]] being released in 2017,<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 June 2015 |title=NES Horror Legend is Turning into a Real Game |url=https://kotaku.com/nes-horror-legend-is-turning-into-a-real-game-1709410435}}</ref> however it has closed down production in 2023.<!-- It's shown on the official Discord for the game that a announcement was made from the developer showing this, but I don't know if I can source it. -->
