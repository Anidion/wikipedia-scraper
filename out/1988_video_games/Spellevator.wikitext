'''''Spellevator''''' is an [[educational video game]] for the [[Apple II]] published by [[MECC]] in 1988.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a [[dust bunny]], which is chased by several [[vacuum cleaner]]s with different movement patterns. The objective of the level is to grab all the letters and exit through the upper left corner. The player can pass through an unoccupied elevator (some vacuum cleaners use elevators also) by correctly answering a spelling or vocabulary question. Once one completes a level, the player can receive a bonus by correctly unscrambling the letters one grabbed into a word).

''Spellevator'' has a utility on the disk's flipside that let a user create a word list and save it to any [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]] formatted floppy disk. This way, teachers could customize the game to fit their own particular vocabulary lists.

==Legacy==
''Spellevator'' was followed by ''Spellevator Plus'' for additional platforms.
