==Gameplay==
The [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] wants to take a vacation on an island, but he lacks the funds to do so. To raise the necessary money he takes a job as a butler so he can rob the wealthy homeowners of their belongings while they sleep. The game takes place across several mansions, played one at a time. Playing as the Pink Panther, the player must purchase the items necessary to qualify for each butler job. Such requirements include a top hat for the first mansion, and a car for one of the later mansions. In each mansion, the homeowner turns out to be a sleepwalker. The player must rob belongings around the house while simultaneously preventing the homeowner from bumping into obstacles, which will wake up the owner and foil the Pink Panther's theft.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YS/><ref name=TGM2/> In each mansion, the player has a side view of the home with several floors visible on the screen.<ref name=ACAR/>

The player must also avoid [[Inspector Clouseau]], who looks for the Pink Panther in each mansion. The player has various items that can be used to avoid Clouseau and also prevent the sleepwalking homeowner from waking up. Items such as catapults and springboards can be used to help the homeowner get across obstacles, and a bell can also be used to redirect the owner in different directions. Another item is an inflatable Pink Panther, which can be used to distract Clouseau.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YS/><ref name=TGM2/>

Some critics considered the game to be a disappointment,<ref name=CCI/><ref name=SU/> and others believed that only ''Pink Panther'' fans would enjoy it.<ref name=CVG/><ref name=YS/><ref name=STA/> Reviewers were critical of the game's control and difficulty.<ref name=CU/><ref name=YA/><ref name=CVG/><ref name=STA/><ref name=SU/><ref name=TGM2/><ref name=CCI/><ref name=Crash/> Mark Patterson of ''[[Commodore User]]'' stated that ''Pink Panther'' "was a potentially good idea but it's over-shadowed by its extreme and sometimes tedious level of difficulty."<ref name=CU/> Gordon Hamlett of ''Your Amiga'' called the gameplay "disastrous," stating that it was too complicated to use items in the game. Hamlett wrote, "The objects are frequently unidentifiable and by the time you have worked out what you think you might like to try, your master has hit a wall and you have to start all over again."<ref name=YA/>

''[[The Games Machine]]'' also criticized the "awkward" system used to manipulate the homeowner's movements, stating that it "requires rapid and accurate reactions, and if a single mistake is made, you have to go right back to the beginning."<ref name=TGM2/> Tony Horgan of ''[[Commodore Computing International]]'' considered the "extremely awkward controls" to be one of the worst aspects of the game, writing that "the combinations of joystick position and fire button needed to select and place the right object can be infuriatingly difficult to carry out."<ref name=CCI/> Eugene Lacey of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' was also critical of the number of joystick and key-pressing maneuvers required to select and activate items, and stated that the game would have benefited from a higher degree of playability.<ref name=CVG>{{cite magazine |last=Lacey |first=Eugene |date=May 1988 |title=Reviews: Pink Panther |magazine=Computer and Video Games |location=United Kingdom |pages=42â€“43}}</ref> Steve Merrett of ''[[ST Action]]'' wrote, "Having to redirect the sleepwalker is tedious and having finally managed it on one occasion, the wretched Inspector caught me straight away."<ref name=STA/>

The magazine considered the [[Commodore 64]] (C64) version the best-looking of the 8-bit versions, while stating that the [[Amstrad CPC]] version had "cramped [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s".<ref name=TGM2/> Critics stated that the [[ZX Spectrum]] version suffered from [[attribute clash]].<ref name=Crash/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YS/> Horgan, reviewing the C64 version, stated that the Pink Panther's limited frames of animation "are not enough to give fluid movement."<ref name=CCI/>

Thomas Brandt of ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' praised all aspects of the Amiga version, including the graphics and sound.<ref name=ASM>{{cite magazine |last=Brandt |first=Thomas |date=April 1988 |title=Der elegante Dieb |magazine=Aktueller Software Markt |location=Germany |language=German |page=13}}</ref> Hamlett praised the sound as well,<ref name=YA/> and ''The Games Machine'' praised the music.<ref name=TGM1/> Reviewers for ''[[Zzap!64]]'' criticized the music,<ref name=Zap/> which was described by Horgan as depressing.<ref name=CCI/> Reviewers for ''ST Action'' criticized the lack of the [[The Pink Panther Theme|Pink Panther theme music]],<ref name=STA/> and Lawton considered the music to be a poor imitation of the theme.<ref name=ACE/> Reviewers for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' criticized the lack of music in the 48k and 128k versions of the ZX Spectrum game.<ref name=Crash/>
