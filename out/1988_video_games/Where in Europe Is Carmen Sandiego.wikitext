'''''Where in Europe Is Carmen Sandiego?''''' is a 1988 European geography-based educational computer game in the ''[[Carmen Sandiego (video game series)|Carmen Sandiego]]'' detective mystery franchise. It was originally published by [[Broderbund]] in [[1988]] for [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[DOS]], and ported to the [[Amiga]] and [[Macintosh]] in [[1989]]. It is the third ''Carmen Sandiego'' title, after [[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985 video game)|''Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?'' (1985)]] and [[Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego? (1986 video game)|''Where in the USA Is Carmen Sandiego?'' (1986)]]. Under the guidance of The Acme Agency's chief, the player completes cases to catch Carmen's henchmen; they accomplish this by traveling to [[Europe]]an [[City|cities]] to find clues relating to the crook's last known whereabouts, and by gaining enough character data to issue a warrant of arrest. Once the player has captured all 15 thieves, they can pursue Carmen herself.

Critics noted that the game followed the design of its ''Carmen Sandiego'' predecessors, and gave it generally favourable reviews.

== Plot ==
Similar to the previous games in the series, ''Europe'' focuses on notorious master thief and leader of V.I.L.E crime syndicate Carmen Sandiego, whose band of crooks successfully stole a series of items after Sandiego broke out of a maximum security prison.<ref name="holzberg198808" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Play_1988-09_Computer_Play_Magazine_US#page/n6/mode/1up/search/carmen+sandiego|title=Computer Play (1988-09)(Computer Play Magazine)(US)|website=archive.org|date=September 1988 |access-date=2017-02-06}}</ref> While ''World'' and ''Time'' saw the crooks take worldwide and historical items, respectively, this game sees them take famous European items.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> As with other entries in the series, stolen items are not always physical and feasible; for instance one thief steals the [[geyser]]s of [[Iceland]]. Some are even fictitious, such as [[James Bond]]'s [[Aston Martin]] being stolen from the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=":0" /> The player's detective agency, The Acme Agency, has joined forces with [[Interpol]], and has been tasked by the Chief to track down Carmen's crooks and stop Carmen.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> The player achieves this by traveling to locations, collecting clues, creating arrest warrants, and finally tracking down and arresting the criminals, thereby retrieving the stolen items. The Chief will introduce the stolen object at the beginning of each case, and sends the player off to the thief's last known whereabouts.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> 16 cases are included, and 34 countries ranging from east ([[Soviet Union|USSR]]) to west (Iceland) Europe are featured.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> Starting as a gumshoe, players advance in rank within the Bureau as they succeed in cases and get promoted, until the final case when they have a shot at catching Carmen herself, when the player will achieve the level of Super Sleuth and have completed the game.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/32-commodore-magazine/Commodore_Magazine_Vol-10-N08_1989_Aug#page/n19/mode/1up/search/carmen+sandiego|title=Commodore Magazine Issue 32|website=archive.org|date=August 1989 |access-date=2017-02-06}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
The player has an in-game week to solve each mystery; the time ticks down when players do activities such as investigating, travelling, going to the Crime Lab, or even being inactive for too long (referred to as "sleeping").<ref name=":4" /> If the player takes too long, they are automatically sent back to the Chief, who will brief them on a new case.<ref name=":4" /> When following the thief's trail, the player investigates by receiving information on the current location and the next known whereabouts of the crook.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> According to Broderbund, the game contained 1000 clues in total.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> When the player has gone to the correct location, they will receive an audio and visual feedback loop, including the text "A VILE (Villans International League of Evil) henchman. You must be on the right track"; conversely, a player will be given negative responses when trying to investigate in an incorrect location.<ref name=":4" /> Throughout each case, the Chief will send the player information about the suspect via Telegrams and Notes, such as their eye colour, hair colour, gender, and favourite movie. As opposed to earlier Carmen Sandiego releases, extra cultural learning opportunities are subliminally contained within the I.D. and geographic clues, through their references to cultural terminology such as "[[Epic poetry|epic poem]]".<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":2"/> Players will have to jot this down into their Crimestopper's Notebook, which automatically updates the character profiling software Crime Lab, which will issue a warrant from a list of suspects once there is only one suspect remaining.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> Even if the player locates the crook, if they don't have sufficient warrant papers the judge will let the suspect go free.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> If the player is successful, they receive a congratulatory message from the Chief before being briefed on the next case.<ref name=":3" /> In solving clues, hints are available in the Detective Guide, an on-line database  with information on flags, currencies, and languages, as well as the physical atlas provided with the game.<ref name="holzberg198808" />

The game opens at the entrance to the ACME European agency, where a robot says "Humanoid at console, Please log on"; the player can either use the same name of an in-progress game to continue, or type in a new name to start a fresh game.<ref name=":4" /> The left-hand of the screen had a colourful and cartoonish depiction of a landmark within the country the player was currently located in. At the top of the right-hand side of the screen there is either a clue about which location Carmen's crook has escaped to or information to add to their warrant, or a geographical, economic, or cultural fact about the location. An interface of options was below; players used this section of the screen to investigate, ask the locals for information, go to the airport to travel to a new location, or update their warrant. Almost all actions could be done by using the arrow keys or a joystick so there was little need to type with a keyboard.<ref name=":0" /> Apple II users were unable to use the mouse.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> The title contained a Save Game option to allow the player to return to an unfinished upon their return; each user name had only one save slot.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> The sound could be toggled on and off by pressing a keyboard key.<ref name="holzberg198808" />

As in all Carmen Sandiego games, there is an educational element to the gameplay. Facts about European history and geography are included in each location. [[Rand McNally|Rand McNally's]] ''Concise Atlas of Europe'' was included, and the game also contained a database of information on flag colors, currencies and languages, the first game in the series to do so.<ref name=":0" /> In addition to the atlas, players also received a User's Manual, and a physical poster with suspects on one side and facts about Europe on the other.<ref name="holzberg198808" /> The game was made secure against [[video game piracy]] by requiring the player to answer questions based on the hard-copy atlas before allowing further progress. This was an early method of protection.

Carol S. Holsberg of ''[[Compute!]]'' praised the "winner" for its graphics, animation, ease of use, and for being just as exciting as its predecessors ''World'' and ''Time'', commenting that it would appeal to educators, parents, and children. Holsberg thought the title demonstrated the ability of computers to be effective teaching tools that engages kids in a narrative while surreptitiously teaching them a wealth of worldly knowledge. ''[[Compute!]]'' suggested that Broderbund should provide a {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch option for the Apple II to reduce disk swapping, particularly with the 3.5 drive becoming far more commonplace with all the [[Apple IIGS]] machines available in homes and schools, and hoped the game would inspire other regional versions of ''Carmen Sandiego''.<ref name="holzberg198808">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-08-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_099_1988_Aug#page/n73/mode/2up | title=Where in Europe is Carmen Sandiego? | work=Compute! | date=August 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Holzberg, Carol S. | pages=73}}</ref> In Issue #75 of ''Computist'', three Carmen Sandiego games were reviewed by Jeff Hurlburt (''World'', ''Europe'', and ''Time''), and ''Europe'' was the lowest scored due to being less realistic; nevertheless the magazine praised the game for its colourful high resolution scenes and effective use of game windows, while noting that it used essentially the same format of the previous entries in the series. Hurlburt disliked how Telegrams and Notes were sent directly to the player from the Chief thereby eliminating the thrill of investigating and sleuthing, though concluded that it was an enjoyable way for players to learn more about Europe.<ref name=":2" />

John Pustai of ''Commodore'' magazine thought the CIA-inspired Detective Guide, a new addition in this game, was a powerful educational tool that reinforced database information within a "computer-sided instruction environment", thereby adding to the title's educational value. He highly praised the user manual for not only providing operational information, but also strategies on how to advance through the game. Pustai thought the program could be used by children to reinforce content learnt in the school system, while also appealing to adults who would be motivated at the challenge of apprehending criminals; he noted that it was worthy of multiple excellence awards and concluded that the title demonstrated that the ''Carmen Sandiego'' franchise had limitless potential.<ref name=":4" /> ''Computer Play''<nowiki/>'s Rusel Demaria noted that the game had a similar format to ''World'' and ''USA'', while praising its ability to be both "high enjoyable" and "incidentally educational" in an industry where learning is often equated with unpleasantness. He wrote that the game was a rarity in organically getting the player actively enthused about conducting research and looking up facts, while offering a simplistic yet fun simulation of detective work that was "excellent" as a family activity and even appealed to real police officers. Demaria complimented the game's well-integrated graphics and sound, the ease of its menu-driven system, and its replayability, ultimately deeming it a worthy sequel in a series that constituted the best of educational gaming.<ref name=":3" />

L. R. Shannon of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the game for cleverly disguising educational content inside of a video game.<ref name=":0" /> ''InCider'' noted that the game was "less global in scope" than the premiere entry in the franchise, ''Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnlVAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Where%20in%20Europe%20Is%20Carmen%20Sandiego|title=InCider|date=1 January 1989|publisher=1001001 Incorporated|via=Google Books}}</ref> A reviewer in Issue #61 of ''Computist'' thought the game continued the tradition of Carmen Sandiego games simultaneously offering fun and learning, and enjoyed playing it so much they decided to put a deprotected version onto a {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch disk, via a method they printed in the magazine.<ref name=":1" /> Similarly, a reviewer in Issue #76 of the magazine lamented that the game was so "excellent" that it was a shame Broderbund placed copy protection on it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/computist-scan-76/issue76#page/n7/mode/2up/search/%22where+in+europe+is+carmen+sandiego%22|title=Computist Issue #76|website=archive.org|year=1990 |access-date=2017-02-06}}</ref>

In 1989, the game won a [[Software Publishers Association]] Excellence in Software Award for Best Social Studies/Science Program and Best Home Learning Program.<ref name="scisco198908">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-08-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_111_1989_Aug#page/n7/mode/2up | title=the Envelope, Please | work=Compute! | date=August 1989 | accessdate=11 November 2013 | author=Scisco, Peter | pages=6}}</ref>
