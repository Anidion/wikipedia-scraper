{{nihongo|'''''Heavy Unit'''''|ヘビーユニット|Hebii Yunitto}} is a [[Scrolling shooter|horizontally scrolling shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed by [[Kaneko]] and published by [[Taito]] in 1988. It was ported to the [[PC Engine]] by Taito and was released on December 22, 1989. There was also a [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] port by [[Toho]] entitled "Heavy Unit: Mega Drive Special" released on December 26, 1990. The player takes control of a star ship that can transform into a [[mecha]] by obtaining a specific type of power up.

==Plot==
Set in 2013, humankind's first artificial star and planet, "Le Tau", is under attack from genetically modified alien monsters. The player must navigate a "Heavy Unit", a heavily armed, transforming [[mecha]], in order to defeat the onslaught and protect the human colony.

==Gameplay==
The player's ship had two forms: a space-ship and a giant robot. Players started controlling the Heavy Unit in its space-ship form as default. As they progressed, they could change the ship into its robot form, thus changing its firing mode and mobility. A checkpoint was active however and the Heavy Unit only had one hit. [[Power ups]] are dropped by a specific enemy ship which appears in fixed points during the levels. Every level of the game contains a mid-boss and a final boss.
Both the ship and the robot modes use two fire buttons, one for the primary (frontal) fire and one for auxiliary fire. The ship mode uses a frontal laser gun which becomes a spread gun with the power ups, plus missiles which drop like bombs as auxiliary fire. The robot mode has a frontal laser gun which increases in power with the power ups plus homing missiles as auxiliary fire. Hidden bonuses (usually [[Life (video games)#Extra lives|1UPs]]) can be revealed by shooting certain parts of the scenario or by continuously hitting certain indestructible enemies. There is at least one hidden bonus in every level of the game.

===Items===
S - Speed Up: This increased player speed with no limit to how many they could collect.

P - Power Booster: This would increase the player's firepower and could be collected three times before being fully powered up.

B - Shield Unit: This granted the player a shield that could take three hits before dissipating.

T - Transformer: This allowed the ship to transform into its robot form. Collecting it again would change the robot back to a ship.

E - Extend Player: This granted the player an extra life.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Heavy Unit'' on their January 1, 1989 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=347|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 January 1989|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>
