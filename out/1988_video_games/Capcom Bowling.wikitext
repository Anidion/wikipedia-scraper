'''''Capcom Bowling''''' is a top down [[bowling]] [[sports simulation]] game developed by [[Incredible Technologies]]<ref name="FTW">{{Cite web|title=How Golden Tee became the best bar game in America|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/06/golden-tee-the-history-of-a-beer-soaked-american-pastime|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett|date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2017|author=Siegel, Alan|quote=Then, in 1988, Capcom Bowling — a game Incredible Technologies produced — hit arcades.

The controls feature a [[trackball]] which is used to control both direction and power, and two buttons which control left and right spin or hook. Comedic animations play for making certain shots.

The game was released in both an upright cabinet and a cocktail version. Most of the upright cabinets are conversion kits for existing cabinets although a limited number of dedicated cabinets were produced. These cabinets featured a birch plywood finish to mimic a bowling lane, a larger marbled trackball and painted side art.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7267|title=Capcom Bowling|work=Killer List of Videogames|publisher=International Arcade Museum|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref> The Japanese version featured a different cabinet.

An alternate version, ''Coors Light Bowling'', was released the following year.<ref name="KLOV" /> This version features endorsement from the [[beer]] [[Coors Light]]. The title screen is completely different on this version and some of the animations were changed to add Coors Light references.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Capcom Bowling'' on their October 1, 1988 issue as being the most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=341|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 October 1988|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref> In North America, it was a commercial success, selling about 12,000 arcade units by early 1991.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Craven Exits Capcom to Form Leprechaun, Inc.; Walker Now Tops Capcom Sales, Sets Dealer Meet |magazine=RePlay |date=February 1991 |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=36, 38 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-16-issue-no.-5-february-1991-600dpi/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2016%2C%20Issue%20No.%205%20-%20February%201991/page/36}}</ref>

==''Bowlingo''==
In 1990, [[Capcom]] entered the [[bowling]] industry with ''Bowlingo''. It was a [[coin-operated]], [[Electro-mechanical games|electro-mechanical]], fully automated mini [[ten-pin bowling]] installation. It was smaller than a standard [[bowling alley]], designed to be smaller and cheaper for [[amusement arcades]]. ''Bowlingo'' drew significant earnings in North America upon release in 1990.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=A Bowling Alley No Arcade Should Be Without / Capcom Bows "Next ''Final Fight''" With ''Magic Sword'' |magazine=RePlay |date=September 1990 |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=19–20, 68 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-15-issue-no.-12-september-1990-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2015%2C%20Issue%20No.%2012%20-%20September%201990/page/19}}</ref>
