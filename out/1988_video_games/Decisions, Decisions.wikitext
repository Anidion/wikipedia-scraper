'''Decisions, Decisions''' is a 15-part educational [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[video game]] series by [[Tom Snyder Productions]], released from the [[1980s]] to the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/ddockterman/profile|title=David Dockterman Profile|work=Harvard Graduate School|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Decisions, Decisions Trademark - Registration Number 2021985 - Serial Number 75020891: Justia Trademarks |url=http://trademarks.justia.com/750/20/decisions-75020891.html |access-date=2022-03-28 |website=trademarks.justia.com}}</ref> It has also been described as a "media-assisted [[Simulation Game|simulation game]]" series.<ref name="auto">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLY6B5fsUv8C&pg=PA65|title=Teaching TV Production in a Digital World: Integrating Media Literacy|last=Kenny|first=Robert|year=2004|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591581994}}</ref>

==Development==
While [[Tom Snyder (animator)|Tom Snyder]] originally created games that would suit the "one-computer classroom" model, this series was part of a new gaming focus of "choice-driven discussion generators".<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1993/03/24/26soft.h12.html|title=Reaction to Software on Slavery Raises Issues Surrounding New Types of Media|last=West|first=Peter|date=March 24, 1993|website=Education Week|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref> The software was designed specifically to foster academic discussions within the classroom.<ref>[http://www.schoolnet.org.za/conference/sessions/nh/WB_Research.pdf Harness the Power of Projectors and Interactive Whiteboards] {{webarchive|date=July 13, 2017

I thought it would be valuable for my students to discuss what was happening in the world."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2008-08-12 |title=An Interview with David "Dock" Dockterman: The Changing Nature of Educational Software |url=http://ednews.org/articles/27971/1/An-Interview-with-David-quotDockquot-Dockterman--The-Changing-Nature-of-Educational-Software/Page1.html |access-date=2022-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812093602/http://ednews.org/articles/27971/1/An-Interview-with-David-quotDockquot-Dockterman--The-Changing-Nature-of-Educational-Software/Page1.html |archive-date=2008-08-12 }}</ref>

In 1999, a free service Decisions Decisions Online was released, which allowed students to discuss events taken from current headlines, with a new topic featured every month.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://thejournal.com/articles/1999/11/01/fyi--tom-snyder-productions.aspx | title=F.Y.I. - Tom Snyder Productions - }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2001-07-21 |title=Welcome To Decisions, Decisions Online |url=http://ddonline.tomsnyder.com/ |access-date=2022-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010721131455/http://ddonline.tomsnyder.com/ |archive-date=2001-07-21 }}</ref>  Hedrick Ellis, executive producer of Decisions, Decisions Online, was reluctant to introduce advertising, and instead noted that Tom Snyder Productions would eventually charge for the products.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=wikipedia&id=GALE|last58062567=2.1&it=r&sid=ebsco | title=Gale - Product Login }}</ref>

In 2002, Tom Snyder Productions was bought by Scholastic, and this series fell under Scholastic’s Interactive Educational Software division.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2002-02-01 |title=Scholastic purchases software maker Tom Snyder Productions |url=https://www.eschoolnews.com/2002/02/01/scholastic-purchases-software-maker-tom-snyder-productions/ |access-date=2022-03-28 |website=eSchool News}}</ref>

Realwordedtech suggested the series died out because it "was expensive to create and even more difficult for teachers to integrate an increasingly prescribed data-driven curriculum".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Why Ed Tech had it right at the very start but lost its way |url=http://www.realworldedtech.com/2015/10/why-ed-tech-had-it-right-at-very-start.html |access-date=2022-03-28}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Each game puts the players (recommended to be a classroom) into a scenario based on actual facts and encourages them to come up with solutions.

An example is in the title ''Decisions, Decisions: Prejudice'', in which the players take the role of the mayor of a tourist town, in which a newspaper has editorialised against a business trading racial memorabilia.<ref name=":0" /> Students discuss the problem in teams, then enter their strategies into the computer, which advances the story, leading to 300 alternate paths.<ref name=":0" /> Members of the team receive booklets from the perspective of an adviser to the decision maker, for instance in ''Decisions,''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kenebrew|first=Keith Tyson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfMJf6biX2QC&pg=PA8|title=Decisions, Decisions, Decisions: Seeking God's Will|date=March 2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-34223-5}}</ref> ''Decisions: The Environment'', they could be a [[campaign manager]], and [[environmentalist]], a [[scientist]], and an [[economist]]; players then debate this conflicting information to reach a justifiable compromise.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wb3IHdIjzIC&pg=PA52|title=Easy Ways to Make Technology Work for You: From Grade Books to Graphic Organizers|last=Dockterman|first=David A.|date=2002|publisher=Scholastic Inc.|isbn=9780439437615}}</ref>
