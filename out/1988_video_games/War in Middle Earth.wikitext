'''''War in Middle Earth''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] game released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[MSX]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Amiga]], [[Apple IIGS]], and [[Atari ST]] in 1988 by [[Virgin Mastertronic]] on the [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]] label.<ref>{{cite web |title=Back Cover Scan |url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/zxdb/sinclair/entries/0005629/WarInMiddleEarth_Back.jpg |website=Spectrum Computing |access-date=25 November 2021}}</ref>

The game combines both large scale army unit level and small scale character level. All the action happens simultaneously in game world and places could be seen from the map or at the ground level. Individual characters can also be seen in larger battles (in which they either survive or die). If the battle is less than 100 units, approximately, it can be watched on ground level. Otherwise it will be only displayed numerically. On ground level characters can  acquire objects and talk with [[non-player character]]s (such as [[Radagast (Middle-earth)|Radagast]] or [[Tom Bombadil]]).

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1989 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon147">{{cite journal
