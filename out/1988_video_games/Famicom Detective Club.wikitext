{{nihongo foot|'''''Famicom Detective Club'''''|ファミコン探偵倶楽部|Famicom Tantei Club|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[adventure game]] duology developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Famicom Disk System|Family Computer Disk System]]. The first entry, {{nihongo foot|'''''The Missing Heir''''',|消えた後継者|Kieta Kōkeisha|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released in 1988, followed by a prequel released the next year titled {{nihongo foot|'''''The Girl Who Stands Behind'''''.|うしろに立つ少女|Ushiro ni Tatsu Shōjo|also known as ''Famicom Tantei Club Part II''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} In both games, the player takes on the role of a young man solving murder mysteries in the Japanese countryside.

The duology was the first writing project for [[Yoshio Sakamoto]], before he found greater success and recognition with ''[[Metroid]]''. The games were inspired by [[Enix]]'s 1983 adventure game ''[[The Portopia Serial Murder Case]]'', horror films by Italian director [[Dario Argento]], and detective novels by Japanese writer [[Seishi Yokomizo]]. Both games were only released in Japan and received positive reception from critics.

Nintendo revisited the series on the [[Super Famicom]] with a remake of ''The Girl Who Stands Behind'' and an episodic [[Satellaview]] broadcast featuring a new story, ''BS Tantei Club: Yuki ni Kieta Kako''. In 2021, Nintendo released new remakes of ''The Missing Heir'' and ''The Girl Who Stands Behind'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]], developed by [[Mages (company)|Mages]]. The remakes were [[Video game localization|localized]] and released outside Japan.

== Plot ==
===''The Missing Heir''===
The story begins with a man, Amachi, discovering the fallen protagonist on the ground near a cliff. The protagonist discovers that he has lost his memory, and after recuperating, he revisits the cliff and meets a young girl named Ayumi Tachibana. He learns from Ayumi that he is an assistant detective investigating the death of Kiku Ayashiro, and heads over to the nearby Ayashiro estate located in Myoujin village. The Ayashiro family owns a huge plot of land passed down from generation to generation, but there is a strange saying in the village that the dead will return to life to kill anyone who attempts to steal the treasure of the Ayashiro family. As the protagonist investigates the mysterious death of Kiku Ayashiro, he discovers the terrifying connection between this saying and the [[serial killing]]s which take place.

===''The Girl Who Stands Behind''===
Three years before the events of ''The Missing Heir'',<ref name=":3">{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Carlos|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/07/05/famicom-detective-club-part-ii-the-girl-who-stands-behind/|title=Famicom Detective Club Part II: The Girl who Stands Behind|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|date=July 5, 2011|access-date=2021-02-19|archive-date=2021-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514221215/https://venturebeat.com/2011/07/05/famicom-detective-club-part-ii-the-girl-who-stands-behind/|url-status=live}}</ref> The protagonist, a 15-year-old boy, escapes his orphanage to look for his parents. Two police officers chase after the protagonist until Shunsuke Utsugi, a private detective respected by the police, takes him in as an assistant.

A few months later, Utsugi and the protagonist are called to investigate the murder of freshman schoolgirl Yoko Kojima. The protagonist begins gathering information from Ushimitsu High School to solve the Yoko case and connect it with the Genjiro Kaneda case along with the help of Yoko's two high school friends; a girl named Ayumi Tachibana and a boy named Hitomi Kawaii. It soon emerges that Yoko was deep into an investigation of "The Tale of the Girl Who Stands Behind," a rumor involving a ghost of a blood-soaked girl that stands behind a student, and the trio set out to discover the truth behind this rumor.

Writer Toru Osawa intended the packaging artwork for ''The Missing Heir'' to be similar to the posters of [[Toho]]'s Seishi Yokomizo films. However, Osawa and Sakamoto were dissatisfied with the final art, which was commissioned from a company outside Nintendo. As a result, for ''The Girl Who Stands Behind'', Osawa personally created a sketch and layout based on shōjo manga for the packaging artwork, which was completed by a professional artist.<ref name="NinDori"/>

Composer [[Kenji Yamamoto (composer born 1964)|Kenji Yamamoto]] recalled that he had aimed to use the Famicom's sound system to its fullest extent in ''The Girl Who Stands Behind'', and that Sakamoto had instructed him to make the final scene as scary as possible. To accomplish this, Yamamoto set the volume of the regular music to be about half of what normal games used, and then increased the volume to its maximum level for the final scene, so as to startle players.<ref name="NinDori"/>

The ''Famicom Detective Club'' remakes received "mixed or average" reviews on Switch, according to [[review aggregator]] site [[Metacritic]].<ref name="MCFDC:TMH"/><ref name="MCFDC:TGWSB"/> As of June 2021, both games have sold a combined 20,949 physical copies in Japan.<ref>{{cite news|last=Romano|first=Sal|url=https://www.gematsu.com/2021/06/famitsu-sales-6-14-21-6-20-21|title=Famitsu Sales: 6/14/21 – 6/20/21 [Update]|date=June 24, 2021|work=Gematsu|access-date=2021-07-09}}</ref>

The presentation and updated visuals were highly praised by critics. CJ Andriessen of ''[[Destructoid]]'' called the games' artwork "outstanding" and "rich with details," while Graham Russell of ''[[Siliconera]]'' and Chris Scullion of ''[[Video Games Chronicle]]'' similarly described it as feeling like interactive anime.<ref name="DestructFDC"/><ref name="SiliconeraFDC:TMH"/><ref name="VGCFDC"/> Hope Bellingham of ''[[GamesRadar]]'' compared the games' background art and character designs to the 2016 anime film ''[[Your Name]]'', and Kate Gray of ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' wrote that "its modern animation style achieves a lot with a little."<ref name="GRadarFDC"/><ref name="NLifeFDC:TGWSB"/> TJ Denzer of ''[[Shacknews]]'' wrote that the games' presentation was "quite faithful and also thoroughly evolutionary" compared to the 1988 originals.<ref name="SNFDC"/> The music was also well-received, with critics praising the new soundtrack and the option to listen to the original Famicom and Super Famicom music.<ref name="GRadarFDC"/><ref name="NLifeFDC:TGWSB"/><ref name="SNFDC"/><ref name="VGCFDC"/>

The writing and characters were positively received. Denzer praised the games as "telling good, smart mystery narratives," and Bellingham wrote that they were "compelling" and "kept you guessing from start to finish."<ref name="SNFDC"/><ref name="GRadarFDC"/> Andrew King of ''[[GameSpot]]'' called the games' cast of characters "memorable" and "striking," and Andriessen specifically called Ayumi Tachibana "an absolute delight of a character."<ref name="GSpotFDC"/><ref name="DestructFDC"/> Jenni Lada of ''[[Siliconera]]'' wrote that the story of ''The Girl Who Stands Behind'' was "genuinely dramatic and thrilling," and found its suggestion of supernatural elements to be intriguing.<ref name="SiliconeraFDC:TGWSB"/>

The gameplay was largely criticized, with numerous reviewers opining that its 1980s-era design had not aged well, and that its trial-and-error nature was frustrating and repetitive.<ref name="GSpotFDC"/><ref name="SNFDC"/><ref name="NLifeFDC:TGWSB"/><ref name="DestructFDC"/> Lada regarded the gameplay as being "an acquired taste," and felt that players would need a great deal of patience to enjoy it.<ref name="SiliconeraFDC:TGWSB"/> However, critics appreciated the additions of a text log and a notebook to organize case information, which were seen as improvements over the original versions.<ref name="NLifeFDC:TGWSB"/><ref name="DestructFDC"/> The gameplay was frequently compared to that of other adventure games, such as the ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' and ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' series, and critics including Scullion, Gray, and King felt that fans of those titles would also likely enjoy the ''Famicom Detective Club'' games.<ref name="VGCFDC"/><ref name="NLifeFDC:TGWSB"/><ref name="GSpotFDC"/>

Reviewers recommended playing the games together, but were divided on which title they preferred. Some considered ''The Girl Who Stands Behind'' to be superior to ''The Missing Heir'', with Denzer citing gameplay enhancements and higher-quality visuals, while Andriessen described it as being a more "streamlined" and "action-oriented" experience.<ref name="SNFDC"/><ref name="DestructFDC"/> Conversely, King felt ''The Missing Heir'' had more interactive gameplay elements, and Gray wrote that its artwork "has a lot more beautiful moments" in comparison to ''The Girl Who Stands Behind''.<ref name="GSpotFDC"/><ref name="NLifeFDC:TGWSB"/>
