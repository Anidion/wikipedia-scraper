The game world is shown from a side view and scrolls horizontally. The objective is to traverse 20 levels with one or two ducks (namely Herbert and his friend Oscar) to liberate his girlfriend. Herbert can walk, run, swim, and flap. He can lay an egg in a nest turning up once in a while and receives an extra life, and three times a level it is possible to trigger invulnerability for some seconds. Enemies are among others a witch, a sword fighter, thorns on bushes or carnivorous plants. To complete a level, Herbert has to collect gems and to reach the exit on the right within a time limit. There are storable best times for each level and a highscore list.

A level is a half screen high and about six screens wide.
