'''''The Guardian Legend'''''{{#tag:ref|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|''Guardic Gaiden''|ガーディック{{ruby|外伝|がいでん}}|Gādikku Gaiden|lead=yes}}|group="note"}} is a 1988 hybrid [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]]/[[shoot 'em up]] video game developed by [[Compile (publisher)|Compile]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)]]. It is the sequel to the 1986 [[MSX]] game ''Guardic'', and was published and released in [[Japan]] by [[Irem (company)|Irem]] in 1988, in [[North America]] by [[Broderbund]] in 1989, and in [[Europe]] by [[Nintendo]] in 1990.

It incorporates gameplay elements from other games such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', and ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]''. In the game, the player controls a lone protagonist, the Guardian, who is on a quest to destroy a large alien-infested world named Naju before it reaches the planet Earth. The player must deactivate ten safety devices scattered throughout Naju, thus activating the alien world's self-destruct sequence. The player explores Naju in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]] fashion and can acquire different weapons during the course of the game.

''The Guardian Legend'' received mixed reviews from magazines such as ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' and ''[[Nintendo Power]]''. While it has been praised for its impressive graphics, memorable sound, and responsive controls, it has been criticized for its repetitive gameplay and complicated password system. It has since been considered a classic example of a multiple-genre game that set a standard for others such as ''[[Sigma Star Saga]]''.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay varies depending on the player's location within Naju. The player controls the Guardian in humanoid form when exploring the surface of Naju (the Labyrinth) and in spaceship form when investigating Naju's interior (the Dungeon).<ref name="Guardian Legend manual">{{cite book | title=The Guardian Legend | type=Instruction manual booklet | publisher=Broderbund | date=1988 | location=USA | id=NES-GD-USA | isbn=978-1-55790-312-9}}</ref>{{rp|10}} The Guardian has a [[health (game mechanic)|life meter]] that decreases after sustaining damage from enemies; it can be replenished by collecting various items. If the life meter runs out, the Guardian explodes, and the game ends.<ref name="Guardian Legend manual"/>{{rp|7}} The player can use a primary rapid-fire weapon with unlimited ammunition as well as various powerful secondary weapons that consume "power chips" with each use.<ref name="Guardian Legend manual"/>{{rp|6}} Power chips are also used as currency to purchase upgrades for the Guardian in a handful of shops throughout Naju.  Found within the Labyrinth or obtained after defeating a [[Boss (video games)|boss]], these upgrades include primary weapon improvements, new or upgraded secondary weapons, and round, brightly colored creatures called Landers.

Blue and Red Landers, recurring characters in many Compile games, increase the player's maximum life and power chip capacities, respectively.<ref name="Guardian Legend manual"/>{{rp|6,10–13}}{{#tag:ref|The original Japanese name for the Lander creatures is {{nihongo3|ランダー|Randā}}.<ref name="Guardic manual">{{cite book | publisher=[[Irem]] | date=1988-01-29 | title=Gādikku Gaiden toriatsukai setsumei sho | script-title=ja:ガーディック外伝 取扱説明書 | trans-title=Guardic Gaiden instruction manual | language=ja | location=[[Hakusan, Ishikawa]], Japan | id=IF 08<!-- a number shown on the manual's front cover and the back of the game's box. -->}}</ref>{{rp|11}} The names of similar items in ''Guardic'' and the NES version of ''[[Zanac]]'' are [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized]] as "Randar"<ref name="MSXGuardic-randar">{{cite video game | title = Guardic | developer = Compile | date = 1986 | platform = MSX | quote = '''Dialog screen:''' I'M RANDAR!

Some of them are not items but [[non-player character]]s that dispense advice to the player or exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide a [[password (video games)|password]] that allows the player to resume the game at a later time with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as [[Checkpoint (video gaming)#Checkpoints|checkpoint]]s; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off.<ref name="Guardian Legend manual"/>{{rp|7}}

In the [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] portion of the game known as the "Labyrinth", the player explores the surface of Naju in humanoid form in a [[top-down perspective]].<ref name="Guardian Legend manual"/>{{rp|10}} The player must navigate the Labyrinth and find and infiltrate the corridors and ultimately activate Naju's ten safety devices.

Some warp panels lead to rooms containing various clues and story elements while others are gateways to shops, [[password (video games)|password]] rooms, and corridors. Keys allow players to access different portions of the Labyrinth, which they can then explore in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]] fashion.<ref name="Guardian Legend manual"/>{{rp|7}}

In the [[shoot 'em up]] portion of the game known as the "Dungeon", the player battles through Naju's interior in spaceship form. The Dungeon consists of a series of enemy-filled corridors which are found during exploration of the Labyrinth.<ref name="Guardian Legend manual"/>{{rp|7,10}} The player's objective in the Dungeon is to progress through each corridor and defeat the boss at the end. Upon completion, the player destroys the corridor and is returned to the Labyrinth, where a [[power-up]] (and sometimes a warp panel key) is collected as a reward.<ref name="Guardian Legend manual"/>{{rp|7}} While some corridors can be accessed freely, others can only be entered by performing a particular action in the corridor room.

==Plot==
In ''The Guardian Legend'', the player controls the gynoid guardian of Earth, a "highly sophisticated [[aerobot]] [[Transforming robot|transformer]]".{{#tag:ref|Although her name is never stated in ''The Guardian Legend'', she is given the nickname {{nihongo3||ミリア|Miria}} and described as a "System D.P." cyborg in ''Guardic Gaiden''.<ref name="japanmanual1">(in Japanese) ''Guardic Gaiden'' Instruction Manual, p. 9.

The game has received both praise and criticism for its multiple-genre format. It was reviewed by four people in a 1989 issue of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' shortly after the release of the game in 1989. Steve Harris said that the game does more than most shoot 'em ups and that it's a "good follow-up for ''Zanac'' fans". He added that the multiple-genre format "helps elevate the whole title to a much higher level".<ref name="EGM" /> Ed Semrad called the game a ''[[Blaster Master]]'' clone and "only average at best", and he echoed Harris' opinion that those who enjoyed ''Zanac'' would enjoy ''The Guardian Legend''. Donn Nauert said that the game is repetitive and offers little challenge and that it would have been better as a pure shoot 'em up; he pointed to a special password ("TGL") in which players can enter to bypass all of the Labyrinth portions.<ref name="EGM" /><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Top Secret – Tricks of the Trade |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |volume=3 |date=September–October 1989 |page=34}}</ref> Jim Allee also compared the game to ''Zanac'' and repeated what Nauert said about the lack of difficulty except in the boss battles; he overall praised the game for successfully bringing together two distinct themes.<ref name="EGM" />

''The Guardian Legend'' received accolades from the editors of ''Nintendo Power''. The game appeared in the magazine's September 1989 issue, where it debuted at #9 on its "Top 30" NES Chart. The editors praised the game, and described the protagonist as "the ultimate transforming hero".<ref name="NP TOP 30A">{{cite magazine|date=September–October 1989|title=Nintendo Power Top 30|magazine=Nintendo Power|volume=8|pages=82–84}}</ref> The game would remain on the chart for nearly a year.<ref name="NP TOP 30B">{{cite magazine|date=September–October 1990|title=Nintendo Power Top 30|magazine=Nintendo Power|volume=16|pages=22–24}}</ref> In recognition of its achievements, the magazine's editors and staff nominated the game for several awards in its first-ever ''Nintendo Power Awards'' for 1989—among them, "Best Graphics & Sound", "Best Play Control", and "Best Overall"<ref name="NP AWARD1">{{cite magazine|date=March–April 1990|title=Nintendo Power Awards '89|magazine=Nintendo Power|volume=11|pages=96–99}}</ref>—but the game did not win the top award in any of these categories.<ref name="NP AWARD2">{{cite magazine|date=May–June 1990|title=Nintendo Power Awards '89|magazine=Nintendo Power|volume=12|pages=26–29}}</ref> ''Nintendo Power'' published a partial [[Strategy guide|walkthrough]] for the game in the following November 1989 issue.<ref name="NP WALK">{{cite magazine|date=November–December 1989|title=The Guardian Legend|magazine=Nintendo Power|volume=9|pages=69–71}}</ref>

The game received moderate praise in some German gaming magazines after its European release. In ''Video Games'' magazine the reviewer praised the game as being a good action-adventure game in the same style of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''; he notes that the need to find hidden items and areas and the top-down perspective closely resemble the Nintendo classic. He appreciated the variety and extras in the game, the various strategies needed to fight bosses, its difficulty, and the well-done graphics.<ref name="VideoGames">{{cite journal |last=Hengst |first=Michael |title=Konfusion in Raumstation – ''The Guardian Legend'' |journal=Video Games |language=de |volume=1 |date=March 1991 |page=37 |url=http://www.kultpower.de/external_frameset.php3?site=%2Fvideogames_1_komplett%2Fshowpage.php3%3Fim%3D037.jpg&from_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobygames.com%2Fgame%2Fnes%2Fguardian-legend%2Fmobyrank |access-date=2010-03-30 |issue=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724003602/http://www.kultpower.de/external_frameset.php3?site=%2Fvideogames_1_komplett%2Fshowpage.php3%3Fim=037.jpg&from_referer=http:%2F%2Fwww.mobygames.com%2Fgame%2Fnes%2Fguardian-legend%2Fmobyrank |archive-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=live}}</ref> The reviewers from ''Power Play'' compared ''The Guardian Legend'' to ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''[[Salamander (video game)|Life Force]]''. They praised the diverse gameplay and weapons, difficulty, and the mixture of action-adventure and shoot 'em up elements.

The game continued to receive praise from major game reviewers more than a decade since its release. In 2005, Lucas Thomas of the ''[[Evansville Courier & Press]]'' favorably compared ''The Guardian Legend'' with the NES title ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' and the [[Game Boy Advance]] title ''[[Sigma Star Saga]]''; he emphasized Compile's successful fusion of the action-adventure, shoot 'em up and [[action role-playing game]] genres.<ref name="Thomas">{{cite news |last = Thomas |first = Lucas M. |title = {{'}}''Sigma Star''{{'}} Combines RPG, Shoot-Em'-Up Action |newspaper = [[Evansville Courier & Press]] |page = D11 |date = 2005-08-18 |access-date = 2008-06-25 |url = http://www.courierpress.com/news/2005/aug/18/game-time-sigma-star-saga/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606161806/http://www.courierpress.com/news/2005/aug/18/game-time-sigma-star-saga/ |archive-date = 2011-06-06 |url-status = dead}}</ref> Later, in a 2008 [[IGN]] article, Thomas listed the game at #2 on his "Top 10 Unreleased NES Hits" list and contended that ''The Guardian Legend'' took the concept of the multiple-genre game to a farther extent than ''Blaster Master''.<ref name="ThomasIGN">{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Lucas M. |title=Retro Remix: Top 10 Unreleased NES Hits |website=IGN |date=2008-10-10 |access-date=2009-07-15 |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/918/918501p5.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014071950/http://wii.ign.com/articles/918/918501p5.html |archive-date=2008-10-14 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In October 2009, IGN ranked ''The Guardian Legend'' as #87 on its "Top 100 NES Games of All Time" list and deemed it "one of the most influential games in the history of the gaming industry".<ref>{{cite web |last=Ng |first=Stephen |title=Top 100 NES Games of All Time |website=IGN |access-date=2009-10-13 |url=http://www.ign.com/top-100-nes-games/87.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017080142/http://www.ign.com/top-100-nes-games/87.html |archive-date=2009-10-17 |url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2008, ''[[Game Informer]]'' editors referred to the game as "the ultimate genre bender" and likened it to a combination of the NES games ''The Legend of Zelda'', ''[[Metroid]]'', and ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]''. While they acclaimed the game for its "exciting and challenging" shooter stages, they criticized it for its complex world map and "outrageous" password system.<ref name="Informer" /> In a [[Gamasutra]] interview, ''[[Retro Game Challenge]]'' designer Mike Engler said that "''The Guardian Legend'' is one of the best games ever released".<ref>{{cite web |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |title=Interview: On Localizing ''Retro Game Challenge'' |website=[[Gamasutra]] |date=2009-02-12 |access-date=2009-03-20 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22179 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014131709/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22179 |archive-date=2012-10-14 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The graphics and sound of ''The Guardian Legend'' have been influential. Robert Dewar and Matthew Smosna of the [[Open system (computing)|open computing]] magazine ''Open Systems Today'' cited the game as an example of how [[Picture Processing Unit|graphics co-processors]] such as those in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] can compensate for inadequate [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed in graphics-intensive computer applications.<ref name="Dewar">{{cite journal | last = Dewar | first = Robert B.
