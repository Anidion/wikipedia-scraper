'''''Ninja Spirit''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Saigo no Nindō'''''|最後の忍道||"The Final Path of a Ninja"}}, is a 1988 [[side-scrolling]] [[hack and slash]] game developed and released in arcades by [[Irem]]. Although praised by gamers for detailed graphics, serious themes, solid controls and gameplay, the game also was criticized for its harsh difficulty.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Ninja Spirit (Saigo no Nindō).png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]

Tsukikage's journey takes him through seven stages, varying from [[woodland]]s, wastelands, swamps, temples, and cliffs. Each stage begins with the player slashing their way to the end until they confront a level boss.

The ninja is always armed with the [[katana]] named Muramasa (meaning Righteous Cloud), which can be fluidly used to attack in all directions. Extra weapons include the Uzha (meaning Swirling Leaf) ([[shuriken]]s), the Raitake (meaning Bamboo Thunder) bombs, and the Shoryusai (meaning Rising Dragon) [[kusarigama]]. There are also several [[power-up]] items, such as one unleashing multiple ninja ghosts to assist the player.

== Plot ==
The game's hero, {{nihongo|Tsukikage|月影}}, is a young [[ninja]] who lost his father to a mysterious half-man half-beast creature. The plot of ''Ninja Spirit'' is based on the quest of his way to avenge his father in an alternative [[feudal Japan]].

== Ports ==
The game was successfully ported onto multiple platforms. The most popular port is the [[TurboGrafx-16]] format which includes two modes: the PC Engine mode which players lose one life only if all 5 energy points are used up (certain enemies can kill Tsukikage with one hit), and the Arcade mode, which is a more challenging mode where any attack are grounds for players to lose one ninja instantly.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ninja Spirit for Wii |url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rWat9tfcXQAD2sJdUXR045uwWj4pAqwf |website=Nintendo |access-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926062015if_/https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rWat9tfcXQAD2sJdUXR045uwWj4pAqwf |archive-date=26 September 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> That version was ported to the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] on 14 May 2007, was delisted on 30 March 2012 and was available again in September 2013.

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Ninja Spirit'' on their September 1, 1988 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles like ''[[The Main Event (video game)|The Main Event]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=339|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 September 1988|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>

In issue 15 of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', both ''Ninja Spirit'' and ''[[Ys Book I & II]]'' were the first games to receive a perfect 10 in the magazine's history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly Issue 15 |url=https://www.retromags.com/magazines/usa/electronic-gaming-monthly/electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-15 |website=Retromags |publisher=Sendai Publishing |access-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813231846/https://www.retromags.com/magazines/usa/electronic-gaming-monthly/electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-15 |archive-date=13 August 2021 |date=October 1990 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2010, [[CraveOnline]] featured this version in the article Top 10 Ninja Games Of All Time, comparing it with ''[[Legend of Kage]]'' for the NES, but considered both "challenging" and "relaxing" at the same time.<ref>[http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/articles/150214-top-10-ninja-games-of-all-time Top 10 Ninja Games Of All Time] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711192244/http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/articles/150214-top-10-ninja-games-of-all-time |date=2015-07-11}}, CraveOnline, September 18, 2008</ref>
