''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' reviewed the Amstrad CPC version and said that "[w]hile the display is colourful, the screen updating is tediously slow, as the screen is re-drawn rather than scrolled." The review was concluded: "A simple wargame then that provides a nice design feature and a vicious computer opponent but not much else."<ref name="ACE1"/> ''[[Amstrad Action]]'' said the sound and graphics are simple, the play area is too small, and each scenario is over too quickly.<ref name="AA"/> In a review of the Amiga version, ''ACE'' noted that the "scrolling and sound effects are much better than the [[8-bit]] versions [...]"<ref name="ACE3"/> ''[[.info (magazine)|.info]]'' said: "Wargames come and wargames go, and Firezone will be no memorable than most of the rest, but it's a pleasant enough
diversion to burn up a few afternoons."<ref name="info"/> ''[[Amiga User International]]'' concluded: "The game is simple to play, but is nevertheless addictive in its qualities".<ref name="AUI"/> ''The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review'' noted the game as very user friendly and the overall presentation as excellent. The game was said to be "[a] good introductory game for newcomers, which still provides experienced veterans with a serious challenge."<ref name="ACAR"/> ''{{ill|Datormagazin|sv}}'' didn't recommended to buy the game since there are much better strategy games on the Amiga.<ref name="DM"/>
