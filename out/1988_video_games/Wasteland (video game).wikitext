'''''Wasteland''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay Productions]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1988.<ref name="Nutt1">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/266770/Wasteland_Developing_an_openworld_RPG_in_1988.php |title=Wasteland : Developing an open-world RPG in 1988 |first=Christian |last=Nutt |date=February 26, 2016 |access-date=February 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207062757/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/266770/Wasteland_Developing_an_openworld_RPG_in_1988.php |archive-date=February 7, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first installment of the ''[[Wasteland (series)|Wasteland]]'' series, it is set in a futuristic, [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] America destroyed by a [[nuclear holocaust]] generations before. Developers originally made the game for the [[Apple II]] and it was [[porting|ported]] to the [[Commodore 64]] and [[MS-DOS]]. It was re-released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] in 2013 via [[Steam (service)|Steam]] and [[GOG.com]], and in 2014 via [[Desura]]. A remastered version titled ''Wasteland Remastered'' was released on February 25, 2020, in honor of the original game's 30th anniversary.

Critically acclaimed and commercially successful, ''Wasteland'' was intended to be followed by two separate sequels in the 1990s, but Electronic Arts dropped claims of ''[[Fountain of Dreams]]'' being a sequel and Interplay's ''[[Meantime (video game)|Meantime]]'' was canceled. The game's general setting and concept inspired Interplay's 1997 role-playing video game ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' and the [[Fallout (franchise)|''Fallout'' series]]. Decades later, [[inXile Entertainment]], founded by the game's director [[Brian Fargo]], released two proper sequels: ''[[Wasteland 2]]'' (2014) and ''[[Wasteland 3]]'' (2020).

''Wasteland''{{'}}s game mechanics are based on those used in tabletop role-playing games, such as ''[[Tunnels & Trolls]]'' and ''[[Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes]]'' created by ''Wasteland'' designers [[Ken St. Andre]] and [[Michael Stackpole]].<ref name=Tringham>{{cite book |last=Tringham |first=Neal Roger |date=September 4, 2014 |title=Science Fiction Video Games |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QH3SBQAAQBAJ |publisher=CRC Press |page=203 |isbn=9781482203899 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309075246/https://books.google.com/books?id=QH3SBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |archive-date=March 9, 2017}}</ref> Characters in ''Wasteland'' have seven attributes{{endash}}strength, intelligence, luck, speed, agility, dexterity, and charisma{{endash}}that allow the characters to use different skills and weapons.

''Wasteland'' was one of the first games featuring a [[persistent world]], where changes to the game's [[open world]] were stored and kept.<ref name=ign/> Returning to an area later in the game, the player would find it in the state the player left it, rather than being reset, as was common for games of the time. Since hard drives were still rare in home computers in 1988, this meant the original game disk had to be copied first.<ref name="refcard">{{cite web |url=http://mocagh.org/ea/wasteland-refcard.pdf |title=Commodore 64/128 Wasteland Reference Card |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926104344/http://www.mocagh.org/ea/wasteland-refcard.pdf |archive-date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>

Another feature of the game was the inclusion of a printed collection of paragraphs that the player would read at the appropriate times.<ref name=retro>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-03-25-retrospective-wasteland |title=Retrospective: Wasteland |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=March 25, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328125115/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-03-25-retrospective-wasteland |archive-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> These paragraphs described encounters, conversations and contained clues. Because [[Disk storage|disk space]] was at a premium, it saved on resources to have most of the game's story printed out in a separate manual rather than stored within the game's code itself. The paragraph books also served as a rudimentary form of [[copy protection]]; someone playing a copied version of the game would miss out on story elements and clues necessary to progress. The paragraphs included an unrelated story line about a mission to [[Mars]] intended to mislead those who read the paragraphs when not instructed to, and a false set of passwords that would trip up cheaters.<ref name=ign/>

==Plot==
In 2087, generations after the devastation of a global [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] in 1998, a remnant force of the [[United States Army]] called the Desert Rangers operates in the [[Southwestern United States]], acting as peacekeepers to protect fellow survivors and their descendants. A team of Desert Rangers is assigned to investigate a series of disturbances in nearby areas. Throughout the game, the rangers explore the remaining enclaves of human civilization, including a post-apocalyptic [[Las Vegas]].<ref name=ign_top25_2000/>

As the group's investigation deepens, the rangers discover evidence of a larger menace threatening to exterminate what is left of humankind. A pre-war [[artificial intelligence]] operating from a surviving military facility, Base Cochise, is constructing armies of killer machines and cybernetically modified humans to attack human settlements with the help of Irwin Finster, the deranged former commander of the base. Finster has gone so far as to transform himself into a [[cyborg]] under the AI's control. The AI's ultimate goal is to complete Finster's "Project Darwin" and replace the world's "flawed" population with genetically pure specimens. With help from a pre-war [[Android (robot)|android]] named Max, the player recovers the necessary technology and weapons in order to confront the AI at Base Cochise and destroy it by making the base's [[nuclear reactor]] melt down.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Wasteland |developer=[[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=January 2, 1988 |platform=Apple II}}</ref>

In an interview with Hartley and Patricia Lesse for MicroTimes in 1987, game director [[Brian Fargo]] said that [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay Productions]] started work on the game in 1986. He also said the game was created on the [[Apple II]], as it was equally important to him as the [[Commodore 64]]. Fargo described the game as a hybrid of the ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima series]]'' and ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]'', with a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] setting similar to the ''[[Mad Max]]'' film series. As to the combat, Fargo stated that it resembled that of ''The Bard's Tale'' and contained additional strategy elements, including the ability to split or disband the party and change the player's character [[point of view (literature)|point-of-view]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Lesse |first1=Hartley |last2=Lesse |first2=Patricia |title=The Programmer's Tale |magazine=MicroTimes |publisher=BAM Publications Inc. |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=March 1987 |page=200}}</ref>

In later interviews, Fargo said ''Wasteland'' came about after the success of ''The Bard's Tale'' and Interplay's desire to make another role-playing game for [[Electronic Arts]] separate from a sequel to the game. He added that the setting was inspired by his love for ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' and post-apocalyptic fiction.<ref name=Retrogamer>{{cite magazine |author=Ian Dransfield |title=Making of Wasteland |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |location=United Kingdom |issue=134 |pages=32â€“35 |publisher=Imagine Publishing Ltd}}</ref> While searching for a gameplay system for their new game, they came across the system of ''[[Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes]]''.<ref name="FargoHickey">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K5hUDwAAQBAJ&q=wasteland+interplay+road+warrior&pg=PA200 |title=The Minds Behind the Games: Interviews with Cult and Classic Video Game Developers |first=Patrick |last=Hickey Jr. |publisher=McFarland |date=April 9, 2018 |isbn=9781476671109 |access-date=November 4, 2020 |archive-date=April 12, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240412044459/https://books.google.com/books?id=K5hUDwAAQBAJ&q=wasteland+interplay+road+warrior&pg=PA200#v=snippet&q=wasteland%20interplay%20road%20warrior&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|200â€“201}} Its author [[Michael Stackpole]] was announced as the writer for ''Wasteland'' in 1987.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Taking a Peek |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=34 |date=Januaryâ€“February 1987 |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_34.pdf |page=10 |access-date=June 12, 2020 |archive-date=November 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114182231/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_34.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="cgw45">{{cite magazine |title=Sneak Preview: Wasteland |magazine=Computer Gaming World |issue=45 |date=March 1988 |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_45.pdf |page=26 |access-date=June 12, 2020 |archive-date=October 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002213939/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_45.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Alan Pavlish was the lead developer of the game, writing it in Apple II machine language and programming the game to react to player choices. Ken St. Andre said Fargo's pitch to him was for a post-nuclear holocaust game that allowed for weapons capable of inflicting area effect damage to be used and the map be modified "on the fly".{{r|"FargoHickey"|p=203-204}} Fargo said the game was in development for five years.<ref name="chat90">{{cite AV media |people=Barton, Matt |date=January 23, 2011 |title=Matt Chat 90: Wasteland and Fallout with Brian Fargo |type=YouTube video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp2FsFgd9Uo |access-date=January 25, 2023 |archive-date=January 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125211120/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp2FsFgd9Uo |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="FargoHickey"/>{{rp|200â€“201}}

=== Writing ===
[[File:Ken St Andre (cropped).jpeg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ken St Andre]] in 2014; he served as a writer and designer.]]

St. Andre said that Interplay wanted to make a best-seller that would elevate the team's reputation. He said that the story-writing process took more than a year, mostly due to feeding various scenarios into the game to see how it would react. According to St. Andre, he and Stackpole wanted to create something new with the story.{{r|"FargoHickey"|p=202-203}}

The original plot was supposed to be similar to ''[[Red Dawn]]'', with Russians occupying the United States and fighting against Americans engaged in liberating their nation. St. Andre eventually decided to change this and pitched a new story involving killer robots wanting to wipe out and replace humanity, calling it a sort of cross between ''[[The Terminator]]'' and [[Daffy Duck]], with Fargo accepting this new storyline. The game's location was chosen due to St. Andre's familiarity with the area and ability to ensure the locations of real-world places were accurate in the game.{{r|"FargoHickey"|p=202-203}}<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fU-fDwAAQBAJ&q=vintage+games+2.0+wasteland&pg=PA194 |title=Vintage Games 2.0: An Insider Look at the Most Influential Games of All Time |first=Matt |last=Barton |publisher=CRC Press |date=April 9, 2018 |isbn=9781000000924 |access-date=November 4, 2020 |archive-date=April 12, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240412044342/https://books.google.com/books?id=fU-fDwAAQBAJ&q=vintage+games+2.0+wasteland&pg=PA194 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|193â€“196}}

Julia Martin's review for ''[[Challenge (game magazine)|Challenge]]'' favorably recommended the game for those into RPGs and adventure games, comparing it to ''[[Twilight: 2000]]'', praising its combat system, choices and for differing from the usual sword-and-spells fantasy genre.

According to a retrospective review by Richard Cobbett of [[Eurogamer]] in 2012, "even now, it offers a unique RPG world and experience ... a whole fallen civilisation full of puzzles and characters and things to twiddle with, all magically crammed into less than a [[megabyte]] of space."<ref name=retro/> In another retrospective article that same year, IGN's Kristan Reed wrote that "time has not been kind to ''Wasteland'', but its core concepts stand firm."<ref name=ign/>

==Legacy==
===Sequels and spiritual successor===

''Wasteland'' was followed in 1990 by a less-successful intended sequel, ''[[Fountain of Dreams]]'', set in post-war [[Florida]]. The game neither contained any of the code from ''Wasteland'' nor involved any of the staff that worked on it. Electronic Arts eventually decided to downplay its connection to ''Wasteland'', and said it was not a sequel in 2003. Interplay worked on ''[[Meantime (video game)|Meantime]]'', which was advertised as a [[spiritual successor]] to ''Wasteland'' and did not take place in the same universe. Coding of ''Meantime'' was nearly finished and a beta version was produced, but the game was canceled as the [[Apple II]] market declined.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/21/ign-presents-the-history-of-fallout |title=IGN Presents the History of Fallout |last1=McLaughlin |first1=Rus |last2=Kaiser |first2=Rowan |work=IGN |date=July 21, 2010 |access-date=October 5, 2021 |archive-date=July 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719000608/https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/21/ign-presents-the-history-of-fallout |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k1OWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA215 |title=Dungeons and Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games: Second Edition |last1=Barton |first1=Matt |last2=Stacks |first2=Shane |publisher=CRC Press |date=April 18, 2019 |page=215 |isbn=9781351273398 |access-date=November 7, 2021 |archive-date=April 12, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240412044253/https://books.google.com/books?id=k1OWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA215#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

Interplay has described the first ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' game as the spiritual successor to ''Wasteland''. According to ''IGN'', "Interplay's inability to prise the ''Wasteland'' brand name from EA's gnarled fingers actually led to it creating ''Fallout'' in the first place."<ref name=ign/> There are ''Wasteland'' homage elements in ''Fallout'' and ''[[Fallout 2]]'' as well.<ref name=kotaku/><ref name=ign>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/16/why-wasteland-2-is-worth-getting-excited-about |title=Why Wasteland 2 is Worth Getting Excited About |last1=Reed |first=Kristan |work=IGN |date=March 16, 2012 |access-date=October 5, 2021 |archive-date=January 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210128050540/https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/16/why-wasteland-2-is-worth-getting-excited-about |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Re-release===

In an August 2013 Kickstarter update for ''Wasteland 2'', project lead Chris Keenan announced that they had reached an agreement with Electronic Arts to release the original ''Wasteland'' for modern operating systems. He added that it will be given for free to backers of ''Wasteland 2'' on Kickstarter, in addition to being made available for purchase on [[GOG.com|GOG]] and [[Steam (service)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/wasteland-1-to-get-steam-and-gog-releases/ |title=Wasteland 1 to get Steam and GOG releases |work=PC Gamer |first=Tom |last=Sykes |date=August 10, 2013 |access-date=June 12, 2020 |archive-date=June 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612204907/https://www.pcgamer.com/wasteland-1-to-get-steam-and-gog-releases/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The re-release was designed to run on higher resolutions and added a song by [[Mark Morgan (composer)|Mark Morgan]], higher resolution portraits, the ability to use the original game's manual in-game and the paragraph book's text, and expanded the save-game functionality.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.gamezone.com/news/wasteland-1-the-original-classic-goes-gold-for-gog-and-steam/ |title=Wasteland 1 â€“ The Original Classic goes gold for GOG and Steam |work=Gamezone |first=Stephanie |last=Carmichael |date=November 7, 2013 |access-date=June 12, 2020 |archive-date=June 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612214741/https://www.gamezone.com/news/wasteland-1-the-original-classic-goes-gold-for-gog-and-steam/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In November, Keenan announced that the re-release titled ''Wasteland 1: The Original Classic'' had gone gold, and had been submitted to GOG and Steam for approval. In response to the player feedback, inXile included the ability to turn off smoothing, including the manual in tooltips, swapping and tweaking portraits while making it work on [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]]. Those who backed ''[[Torment: Tides of Numenera]]'' and received ''Wasteland 2'', also received the re-release for free.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.vg247.com/2013/11/07/wasteland-1-has-been-submitted-to-good-old-games-and-steam/ |title=Wasteland 1 has been submitted to Good Old Games and Steam |work=[[VG247]] |first=Ewan |last=Miller |date=November 7, 2013 |access-date=June 12, 2020 |archive-date=June 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612210735/https://www.vg247.com/2013/11/07/wasteland-1-has-been-submitted-to-good-old-games-and-steam/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
