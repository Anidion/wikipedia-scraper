'''''Superman''''' is a 1989 [[arcade game|arcade]] [[action game]] released by [[Taito]] and featuring the [[DC Comics]] character [[Superman]]. While not directly based on the original [[Superman (film series)|film series]], throughout much of the game the "[[Superman music|Superman Main Theme]]" and "Can You Read My Mind" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|Superman films]] are used as background music.

In the game, the player assumes the role of Superman, who must fight through five levels to make the world safe from the evil Emperor Zaas, a character exclusive to this game. The game can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with the second player taking control of another Superman with a different colored costume.

== Gameplay ==

The player takes control of Superman, who must fight through five levels to make the world safe from the evil Emperor Zaas, a villain similar to [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The first player takes control of the traditional blue Superman, while the second player takes control of a [[Superman Red/Superman Blue|red Superman]] with a grey cape.<ref name="klov">{{cite web|title=The Killer List of Videogames: Superman|url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9977|accessdate=July 19, 2006}}</ref>  The title starts out in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] before going to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]  Superman is able to punch, kick and fly. He can also use a [[projectile]] "Sonic Blast" attack when the player holds down then releases the punch button. There are also objects in the levels he can throw and/or break. Some of these objects release blue [[crystal]]s that can restore Superman's energy, yellow crystals that allow the player to throw one projectile attack without charging or red crystals in flying stages that defeat all the enemies on the screen.<ref name="flyer">{{cite web|title=Arcade Flyers: Superman|url=http://www.arcadeflyers.net/?page=flyerdb&subpage=thumbs&id=1154|accessdate=July 19, 2006}}</ref> The first four levels have three-parts - a side-scrolling part, followed by a vertically scrolling flying part and a final side-scrolling shooter part where Superman uses heat vision instead of kicking and can destroy or dodge obstacles such as rocks. Each part has a [[boss (video games)|boss]] at the end. The final level, the main boss' spaceship, adds a side-scrolling shooting section to the beginning and an extra final boss fight at the end.

===Second player===
The second player's Superman is identical to the first player's blue Superman, except for the color scheme. Whereas the first player controls Superman in his traditional color scheme (blue tights with a red cape, trunks and boots), the second Superman wears red tights with grey cape, trunks and boots. The presence of this alternate Superman is never explained in the game and is only intended as a co-operative gameplay mechanic.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Superman'' on their March 15, 1989 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=352|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 March 1989|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref> Superman for the arcade was met with mixed reception from reviewers since its release.<ref name="CrashARCs">{{cite magazine|last=Caswell|first=Mark|url=https://archive.org/stream/crash-magazine-63#page/n27/mode/1up|title=Arcades - Superman (Taito)|magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|issue=63|publisher=[[Newsfield Publications]]|date=April 1989|page=28}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the game a positive outlook.<ref name="CVGARCs">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-video-games-magazine-085#page/n140/mode/1up|title=Arcade Action - Superman|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=85|publisher=[[EMAP]]|date=November 1988|page=140}}</ref> ''[[Your Sinclair]]''{{'}}s Ciarán Brennan gave the title an overall negative outlook.<ref name="YSARCs">{{cite magazine|last=Brennan|first=Ciarán|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-36#page/n94/mode/1up|title=Slots Of Fun - Superman (Taito)|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|issue=36|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|date=December 1988|page=103}}</ref> ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' gave it a mixed outlook.<ref name="ACEARCs">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/ACE_Issue_18_1989-03_Future_Publishing_GB#page/n28/mode/1up|title=Arcade Ace: Is it a bird?
