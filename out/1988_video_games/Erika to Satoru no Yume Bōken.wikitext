{{nihongo foot|'''''Erika to Satoru no Yume Bōken'''''|えりかとさとるの夢冒険||lit. "Erika and Satoru's Dream Adventure"|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is a 1988 Japan-exclusive [[Adventure game|adventure]] video game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]]. The setting of this game is 20th century [[Japan]].

Two-player adventure games were seen as very rare at the time of the game's release; even in Japan. However, only one person could partake in the animal quiz portion. Failing the quiz will force the player(s) to start from the beginning.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic game overview |language=Japanese|url=http://www23.atwiki.jp/ggmatome/pages/1450.html|publisher=Wiki summary Ryosaku-masterpiece|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref>

It is one of the few games for the Family Computer to use the Namco 163 wavetable sound chip, and is also one of the games that enables all eight sound channels provided by the chip, the other being ''[[King of Kings (1988 video game)|King of Kings]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Namco_163_audio#Channel_Update |title = Namco 163 audio - Nesdev wiki}}</ref>

The end of the game contains an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in the form of a developer's lengthy profane complaint about his coworkers' behaviour, which can be triggered at the game's ending after a series of button presses.<ref>[http://en.rocketnews24.com/2012/12/19/obscene-messages-from-developer-discovered-in-1980s-nes-game/ "Obscene Messages from Developer Discovered in 1980s NES Game", by Philip Kendall, RocketNews24.com]</ref><ref name=Cracked>{{cite web|title=The 5 Ballsiest Easter Eggs Hidden in Video Games|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_19745_the-5-ballsiest-easter-eggs-hidden-in-video-games_p2.html|date=July 23, 2012|last1=Cantrell|first1=M.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ErikatoSatorunoYumeBoukenHugeBuilding.png|200px|left|thumb|Erika is examining a large building; hoping to find something useful for her quest.]]

Erika and her brother Satoru are siblings who live together in a normal Japanese house. One night, a cat-like being gave them a mission to search for a powerful crown that will alter time and space for the person who possesses it. Players are forced to control both Erika and Satoru simultaneously, causing them to interact with their surroundings at the same time.<ref name="mobygames"/> In-game activities that require two players include [[shoplifting]] and eliminating [[locust]]s.

Interacting with characters and doing their quests will bring players one step closer to retrieving the ''Time Crown'', the item needed to win the game. Manipulating items will allow players to solve the quests. Teamwork becomes important as one character cannot solve certain tasks without the other being present. A player using the second controller can also control one of the characters, freeing up responsibilities from the player using the main controller. When a player visits a landmark on the map, the view switches from a bird's eye view to a first-person perspective.<ref name="mobygames"/> A map where the buildings and surroundings are is always shown, except during storyline sequences and when players need to interact with their surroundings.

There are five different chapters in the game. Once the player completes the third chapter, the [[difficulty level]] becomes drastically harder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Advanced game information |language=Japanese|url=http://www25.atwiki.jp/famicomall/pages/73.html|publisher=FC no Game Seiha Shimasho|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref> Satoru has the weakness of being able to drown, unlike his sister Erika, who can swim in the water levels of the game. Players may use Erika and prevent Satoru from drowning.
