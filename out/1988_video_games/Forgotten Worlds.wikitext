'''''Forgotten Worlds''''', titled {{Nihongo foot|'''''Lost Worlds'''''|ロストワールド|Rosuto Wārudo|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan, is a [[side-scrolling shooter]] video game by [[Capcom]], originally released as a coin-operated [[arcade game]] in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]]. It is notable for being the first title released by Capcom for their [[CP System]] arcade game hardware.<ref name="cpsbrochure"/>

==Plot==
Set in the 29th century, an evil god known as Bios has destroyed most of the Earth, turning it into a desolate wasteland known as the Dust World. Two nameless supersoldiers are created by the people to defeat Bios and the eight evil gods who serve him.<ref name="acmanual"/>

==Gameplay==
''Forgotten Worlds'' can be played by up to two players simultaneously. The player controls a flying muscle-bound soldier armed with a rifle with unlimited ammo. The Player 1 character is equipped with a long-range automatic rifle, while Player 2 has a short-range wide shot. The controls in the original coin-op version consist of an eight-way joystick for moving the character in the air while flying and a unique rotatable button known as the "roll switch".<ref name="acmanual"/> Rotating the switch left or right allows the player to adjust their character's aim in one of sixteen directions, while pressing it causes the player character to shoot his gun. This allows for the player to move their character anywhere while keeping their aim in one direction. Pressing the switch rapidly will cause the character to perform a "megacrush" attack which will destroy all on-screen enemies, but at the expense of a portion of their vitality gauge.

The player character is accompanied by a satellite module orbiting near him that will provide backup firepower every time the player fires their gun. Like the main character, the satellite can also be rotated with the roll switch. Rotating the character while firing will only rotate the aim of the satellite, while rotating the character without firing will not only rotate the satellite's aim, it will also move its relative position around the player.

The player can obtain blue-colored coins known as Zenny from defeating enemies throughout the game. Zenny is used as currency to obtain new power-up items from shops located at certain points in each stage. When the player enters an item shop, they are given a choice of the items available and a limited time to make any purchase they wish. These items consist primarily of new weapons for the satellite module, but also include a health kit to restore lost vitality, armor that allows the player to sustain additional damage, and even tips on how to defeat the boss awaiting at the end of the current stage.

''Forgotten Worlds'' consists of nine stages each with its own boss. The player will lose if their vitality gauge runs out, but will be given a chance to continue.

==Development==
The game took two years to develop, with a production budget between {{USD|5,000,000|1988|round=-6|long=no}} and {{£|5.5 million}} or {{US$|{{To USD|5.5|GBR|year=1988|round=yes}},000,000|1988|round=-6|long=no}}.<ref name="FW-Budget"/><ref name="TGM">{{cite magazine |title=Capcom: A Captive Audience |magazine=[[The Games Machine]] |date=18 May 1989 |issue=19 (June 1989) |publisher=[[Newsfield]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=24–5 |url=https://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-19/page/n23/mode/2up}}</ref> The game used four [[Mebibyte|megabytes]] of [[Sprite (graphics)|sprite]] data.<ref name="FW-Budget"/> The game started off as a regular side-scrolling shooter, but Yoshiki Okamoto wanted a more imaginative game.<ref name="AkiraYasuda"/> During development, Capcom tried to make the game easier to play, having received criticism about how hard it was to dodge enemy projectiles in previous games. As this was the first game to use the [[CPS-1]], Capcom tried to fully maximize its software capabilities.<ref name="FW-CPS1"/> The game did not generate enough income upon its release due to large numbers of shooter games in the market and there were increased expenses due to a shortage of chips needed for the CPS-1 boards.<ref name="AkiraYasuda"/>

==Home versions==
''Forgotten Worlds'' was first ported to various home computers in [[Europe]] by [[U.S. Gold]] in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]]. Versions were produced for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[IBM-compatible PC]]. These versions of the game were developed by [[Arc Developments]].<ref name="FWorlds-Ports"/> The development team had four months to make the conversions. Every graphical frame was digitised directly from the arcade version's screen using a [[NewTek|DigiView Gold]] device and stored the data on an Amiga 500 computer. The God of War was hand sketched, redrawn on the computer and colored with [[Deluxe Paint]], although the mirroring function saved time. Even the shop scene was hand sketched from scratch.<ref name="FW-Sketching"/>

All the home computer version required a joystick controller in order to be played and could not be played with the keyboard only (with the exception of the IBM PC, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC versions). The player rotated the character in these versions by holding the fire button while pushing the joystick left or right.<ref name="pcmanual"/> In the Spectrum sales charts, it was number two, behind ''[[RoboCop (1988 video game)|Robocop]]'', which was number one every month for most of the year.<ref name="ysrnry2"/>

The [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] version, produced by [[Sega]], was released in Japan on November 18, 1989, with subsequent releases in [[North America]] and the [[PAL region]] the following year. The Mega Drive version simulated the controls of the arcade version by using A and C buttons to rotate the character in either direction and the B button for shooting. Unlike in the arcade version, both players are equipped with long-ranged automatic rifles. This version has only seven of the arcade's nine stages and provides an auto-fire feature that can be toggled on or off on the game's settings. In [[2008 in video gaming|2008]], the Mega Drive version was released on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in North America on November 17 and in Europe on November 28.<ref name="FW-VirtualConsole"/>

The [[Master System]] version was also released by Sega in [[Europe]] and [[Brazil]]. This version is 1-player only and due to the presence of only two buttons on the Master System's standard controller, the buttons are used solely to rotate the character, who shoots automatically. The megacrush attack is performed in this version by pressing both buttons simultaneously.
 
The [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] version (published by [[NEC Avenue]]) was released in Japan on March 27, [[1992 in video gaming|1992]] as a Super CD-ROM² title which supported a specialized 3-button controller that NEC released only in Japan. The North American version for the TurboGrafx-16 CD was released by Turbo Technologies Inc. With the 3-button controller, the player can control their character as they would in the Mega Drive version, with two buttons to rotate the character and one to shoot. With the standard TurboGrafx-16 controller, the Run button is used in the place of the third button to rotate the character to the left. The TG16 CD port is one-player only, but allows the player to select between either of the two unknown soldiers at the start of the game (with their respective abilities from the arcade version retained).

A version for the [[Capcom Power System Changer]] was planned and previewed but never released.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/club-capcom-spring-1994_202202#page/n89/mode/2up|title=カプコン アーケードオリジナルボード CPSシリーズ+CPSチェンジャー 限定販売決定!!|magazine=Club Capcom|volume=2|publisher=[[Capcom]]|date=Spring 1994|pages=90–91|lang=ja}}</ref>

An emulation of the original arcade version is included in the [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] compilation ''[[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection Vol.1]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[2006 in video gaming|2006]]'s ''[[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection: Remixed]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]], and also for the [[Nintendo Switch]] as part of ''[[Capcom Arcade Stadium]]'', as well as the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (service)|Steam]]. The PS2 and Xbox versions allow the player to use their respective controllers' right analog sticks to control the player character's aim. In [[2008 in video gaming|2008]] the Mega Drive version was ported to the [[Wii]] as part of the [[Virtual Console]].<ref name="FW-Wii"/>

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Forgotten Worlds'' on their September 1, 1988 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles like ''[[Sky Soldiers]]'' and ''[[Ninja Spirit]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=339|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 September 1988|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, [[U.S. Gold]] predicted the home computer port could outsell their previous best-selling Capcom release ''[[Bionic Commando (1987 video game)|Bionic Commando]]'', which had sold 70,000 copies in the UK as of early 1989.<ref name="TGM"/>

The game was met with highly positive reviews from critics. Upon release, the arcade game received positive reviews from ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', ''[[The Games Machine]]'', ''[[Your Sinclair]]'',<ref name="Arcade"/> and ''[[Commodore User]]''.<ref name="CU59"/> Critics compared the arcade game favorably to earlier shooters including Capcom's ''[[Side Arms]]'' (1986), [[Konami]]'s [[Gradius (video game)|''Nemesis'' (''Gradius'')]] and [[Sega]]'s ''[[Space Harrier]]''.<ref name="Arcade"/>

''The Games Machine'' gave the Amiga version a score of 94%, praising the title's graphics and faithfulness to the arcade version.

===Accolades===
