'''''Ghouls 'n Ghosts''''', known as {{Nihongo|'''''Dai Makaimura'''''|大魔界村||lit. Great Demon World Village|lead=yes}} in Japan, is a [[side-scrolling platform game]] developed by [[Capcom]], released as an [[arcade video game]] in 1988 and [[porting|ported]] to  home platforms. It is the sequel to ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)|Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' and the second game in the ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' series.

It was a commercial success, becoming the eighth highest-grossing [[1989 in video games|arcade game of 1989]] in Japan. It was also critically acclaimed, with the Sega Genesis version winning four awards from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' in 1989, including [[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Game of the Year]].

==Plot==
Three years after the events of ''Ghosts 'n Goblins'', the Ghosts have returned with Ghouls for revenge, initiating a mortal holocaust on the Princess' kingdom as beams of light struck through countless villagers. When Sir Arthur returns to the village, his rescue attempt was too soon as his beloved Princess Prin-Prin also has her soul taken away from her body in front of his very eyes. Now it's up to the heroic knight once again to slay his way to the hellish castle to defeat the evil Lucifer and his legion of demons and restore the souls of Prin-Prin and every mortal.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC Ghouls 'n Ghosts (Daimakaimura).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]

The gameplay for ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' is similar to that of ''Ghosts 'n Goblins''. The player controls the knight [[Arthur (Ghosts 'n Goblins)|Arthur]] who must advance through a series of eerie levels and defeat a number of [[undead]] and demonic creatures in his quest to restore all the people killed by [[Lucifer]] ([[Loki]] in the English-language [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Master System]] versions), including his beloved Princess Prin-Prin, back to life. Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly upward and directly downward while in mid-air.

By jumping in certain spots, players can cause a treasure chest to erupt from the ground. By firing his weapon at the chest, players may uncover new weapons, gold armor or an evil [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] that changes Arthur into an elderly man or a helpless [[duck]]. The gold armor allows players to charge up the weapon to release a powerful magical attack. Each weapon has its own special attack, with the exception of the special weapon (see below).
 
There are six levels. To defeat the game, Arthur must complete levels 1 through 5 twice. Upon completing them the first time, Arthur is taken back to level 1, but this time, a special weapon appears during the game. To enter Lucifer's chamber, the player must have this special weapon equipped, and must have defeated Beelzebub. After entering the final large door, the player goes directly to Lucifer's chamber.

==Music==
The original soundtrack for the arcade version was composed by [[Tamayo Kawamoto]]. Many computer [[porting|ports]] of the game include the soundtrack by [[Tim Follin]] which consists of arrangements and some new songs. Follin's soundtrack – especially [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]] (which both implement each machines' '[[chiptune]]' synthesizers, although the selection of pieces and some scoring differs slightly between computers) and [[Amiga]] versions (of which the playlist is again slightly different) – is respected among computer game music listeners and also gained appreciation from reviewers when the game was published.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tim Follin |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=51}}</ref>

==Versions==
Versions of ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' were released in Europe in 1989 for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. These versions were all handled by [[Software Creations]] and all omit a great deal of detail from the arcade version.

A [[Sega Genesis]] conversion of ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' (programmed by [[Yuji Naka]]) was released by [[Sega]] in 1989 in Japan and North America, and in 1990 in Europe. This version was re-released as a [[handheld TV game]] with ''[[Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition]]'' in 2005 and as a downloadable [[Virtual Console]] game for the [[Wii]] in 2007. This version was also included on the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] in 2019, and on the [[Nintendo Switch Online|Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack]] in 2023. Sega also released a [[Master System]] conversion in 1990. This version introduced a power-up system that allows the player to enter secret shops and upgrade parts of their armor. This includes helmets, which give the player access to new weapons and magic spells; chest armor, which allows the player to sustain more damage; and boots, which increase the player's speed.

A [[SuperGrafx]] conversion of ''Dai Makaimura'' was released by [[NEC Avenue]] in 1990. This version was included on the [[TurboGrafx-16 Mini]] in 2020. A version of ''Dai Makaimura'' was released by Capcom in 1994 for the Sharp [[X68000]].

A version for the [[Capcom Power System Changer]] was planned and previewed but never released.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/club-capcom-spring-1994_202202#page/n89/mode/2up|title=カプコン アーケードオリジナルボード CPSシリーズ+CPSチェンジャー 限定販売決定!!|magazine=Club Capcom|volume=2|publisher=[[Capcom]]|date=Spring 1994|pages=90–91|lang=ja}}</ref>

In 1998, Capcom released ''[[Capcom Generations|Capcom Generation 2]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] in Japan, a compilation which included ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' along with ''Ghosts 'n Goblins'' and ''Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts''. The PlayStation version of this compilation was released as a bundle in Europe with three other volumes titled ''Capcom Generations'' (in plural) under the title of ''Capcom Generations: Chronicles of Arthur''. Capcom later released in North America ''[[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in 2005 and ''Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2006, which includes all the ''Capcom Generations'' titles. The arcade version of ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' was re-released as one of the included games on the Capcom Home Arcade console in 2019.
