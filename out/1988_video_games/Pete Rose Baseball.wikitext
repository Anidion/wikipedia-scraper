==Gameplay==
The game features a "behind the pitcher" viewpoint for pitching and batting, a viewpoint which was introduced by the classic computer game ''[[Hardball (computer game)|Hardball]]''. In addition, the game features different "bird's eye" views of the field depending on where the ball is hit; there are two infield views (one for each half of the infield) and three outfield views (left field, center field, and right field).

==Legacy==
When the game was re-released by [[Activision]] (who bought Absolute's video game properties after Absolute folded in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]) for inclusion in ''[[Activision Anthology]]'', the game was renamed ''Baseball'', due to the license deal with [[Pete Rose]] having expired.
