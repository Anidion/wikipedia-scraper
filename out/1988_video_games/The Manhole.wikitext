==Reception==
Describing ''The Manhole'' as "the first children's software to require a hard disk", ''[[Macworld]]'' in March 1989 stated that its "realistic sounds, the fantasy-filled graphics, and the stack construction are truly impressive". The magazine "highly recommended [the game] for young children[, and] it's hard to imagine a playful soul of any age who wouldn't enjoy exploring the mind-tickling world inside The Manhole".<ref name="beekman198903">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/MacWorld_8903_March_1989#page/n201/mode/2up | title=HyperCard Entertainment Stacks | magazine=[[Macworld]] | date=March 1989 | access-date=20 August 2016 | last=Beekman | first=George | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=190–192}}</ref>
