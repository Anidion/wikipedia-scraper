'''''Bionic Commando''''', originally released as {{nihongo|'''''Hitler's Resurrection: Top Secret'''''|ヒットラーの復活 {{ruby|TOP SECRET|トップシークレット}}|Hittorā no Fukkatsu: Toppu Shīkuretto|}} in Japan, is a [[platform game]] released by [[Capcom]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1988.<ref name="Famitsu" /> It is based on the 1987 [[arcade game]] ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade game)|Bionic Commando]]''.

As such, the series is one of few instances of a [[platform game]] in which the player cannot jump. To cross gaps or climb ledges, Ladd must use his bionic arm.

In the game's instruction manual, the character is only known as "Player". In the game's ending, his name is revealed as "Ladd". The Game Boy version, a retelling of this game, calls the character "Rad". In the Game Boy Color remake, the main character is unnamed. His full name of Nathan "Rad" Spencer was revealed in 2009's ''Bionic Commando'' for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Bionic Commando.png|thumb|Ladd cannot jump, so he uses his bionic arm to swing across gaps and obstacles.]]
''Bionic Commando'' is a [[platform game]] in which the player controls Ladd, whose mission is to rescue Super Joe and to stop the Albatros project.<ref name="NP2">{{cite magazine |title=''Bionic Commando'' |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |location=[[Redmond, WA]] |issue=2 |date=September–October 1988 |pages=6–17 |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582}}</ref> The game begins on an overworld map, where, Starting at Area 0, players can move Ladd's helicopter to any connected Area on the map in a [[nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear fashion]]. Each time Ladd's helicopter moves, the enemy ground vehicles will also move. Once the helicopter reaches its destination without crossing over the path of an enemy vehicle, the player can choose to "descend" and play that area or to "transfer" to a different Area.<ref name="NES manual">{{cite book|title=Bionic Commando Instruction Manual |publisher=[[Capcom]] |year=1988 |location=[[Sunnyvale, CA]] |id=NES-CM-USA}}</ref>{{rp|7–9}} If the helicopter is intercepted by an enemy vehicle, then Ladd must engage the enemy in an overhead shooter level similar to Capcom's ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]''. Ladd, armed with a weapon and his grappling hook that he can swing around in a circle to deflect bullets and enemies, must defeat the enemy soldiers and reach the end of the stage. These are the only stages where the player can earn a [[continue (video games)|continue]].<ref name="NP2" />

When Ladd descends into an Area, the player must choose which equipment to take along,<ref name="NES manual"/>{{rp|10–12}} and is then dropped into a sidescrolling platforming level. There, the player must first find one or multiple Communications Rooms - where the player can communicate with allies or wiretap enemy conversations - and then proceed each Area's Computer Room, where a boss will be guarding the computer core the player must destroy to clear the Area. Ladd cannot jump, so the player must use Ladd's weapons and his bionic arm to defeat enemies and navigate platforms and obstacles. Players can extend his bionic arm overhead, directly in front, and above at a 45-degree angle, and can grapple to higher platforms, swing across chasms, and pick up items. Additional equipment such as weapons, protective gear, and communications devices can be found by clearing Areas or finding them in levels, some of which are vital to progressing further in the game. In addition to the regular "combat areas", there are also safe "neutral areas"; non-hostile zones where Ladd can gain additional information from allied and enemy soldiers and find items. If Ladd fires his weapon in any neutral area, an alarm sounds, and all soldiers will become hostile to Ladd.<ref name="NP2" />

==Plot==
<!-- PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING. This plot section is strictly about the NES version and not the later games. Do not replace the names and spellings use in the NES version with those used in the later sequels. In order words, do not replace "Ladd" with "Rad" or "Nathan Spencer" and "Super Joe" with "Joseph Gibson".-->
''Bionic Commando'' takes place sometime in the late 1980s and centers on two warring states: the Federation and the Empire. Federation Forces discover top secret documents about "Albatros", an unfinished project developed by the Empire's predecessor, the "Badds" (also known as the "Nazz"<ref name="NES manual"/>{{rp|4}} or Nazis in the Japanese version). Imperial leader [[Generalissimo]] Killt decides to complete the project himself. Upon learning the Empire's plot, the Federation sends in its national hero, Super Joe (the main character from the 1985 Capcom game ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=''Commando'' (arcade flyer) |publisher=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=219&image=2 |quote=A crack soldier called "Super Joe" who has undergone special training has received a highly secret mission and is about to enter this fierce war.}}</ref>) to infiltrate the Empire, but he is captured. The Federation then sends in a second operative named Ladd to rescue him and to uncover the secret behind the Albatros project.<ref name="NES manual"/>{{rp|4}}<ref name="NP2"/> Ladd is a member of the FF (Double Force) Battalion, a team of commandos specially trained to use wired guns to infiltrate enemy bases.<ref name="Top Secret manual"/>{{rp|4}}

Gameplay begins as Ladd starts in Area 1, in which he is told that the first several areas, already infiltrated by Federation troops, have communication devices and rooms that can be used to stay in contact with the Federation and for [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]] to gain [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] from the Empire. Upon reaching Area 3, Ladd finds through enemy intelligence that Super Joe has been transported to the Imperial "disposal area", which a Federation spy later confirms. However, upon reaching the disposal area, an Imperial commander tells Ladd that Super Joe has been transported elsewhere. Eventually, Ladd locates and rescues Super Joe from a [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]], who informs Ladd that the Albatros project is a powerful laser cannon the Badds were unable to complete. However, the one person vital to the project's completion, Master-D (Hitler), is dead, and Generalissimo Killt has been unsuccessfully trying to resurrect him. Super Joe tells Ladd that they must stop Killt before he succeeds, and he asks Ladd to accompany him to the Imperial base located in Area&nbsp;12.

When Ladd reaches the Imperial base, Super Joe tells him to break the power system in order to release two power barriers that are guarding the incomplete project. After doing so, Super Joe tells Ladd to defeat Killt and escape while he goes to destroy the base's power source. When Ladd reaches Killt's chamber, Killt boasts that the Albatros project has been completed without Master-D's help, turning off the device that would have resurrected him. As Killt is about to kill Ladd, electric shocks begin to occur around the holding tank containing Master-D's body, reviving Master-D and instantly killing Killt. Master-D then exits the tank and approaches Ladd, saying that he will use the Federation's forces to take over the world. Ladd vows to fight against Master-D, who calls Ladd a "damn fool" and unveils the Albatros. After destroying the Albatros, Ladd encounters a dying comrade named Hal, who gives Ladd a [[bazooka]] and tells him that Master-D is escaping and that he needs to shoot the bazooka into the cockpit of Master-D's escape chopper. Ladd uses his bionic arm to swing himself towards Master-D's escape chopper and fires the bazooka into the cockpit; upon doing so, Ladd screams: "Your number's up! Monster!" Then, in a series of slow-motion frames, the game shows Master-D's head explode.

The 60-second alarm inside the Imperial base sounds off. Ladd escapes, realizes that Super Joe is still inside, and runs back in to rescue him. The Federation's commander orders the full evacuation of the base. At the Federation base, troops surround Ladd and Super Joe to celebrate their victory. On August&nbsp;2, 2010, an old Super Joe recalls the entire story and hopes that it will live on.

===Localization===
[[File:Bionic-killt-comparison.PNG|thumb|right|The use of the Nazi Swastika in the Japanese Famicom version was replaced with a new avian symbol for the English NES version.]]
For the release of the international version of the game, several changes were made. All references to [[Nazism]] in text and imagery were removed for the English localization. The Empire in the Japanese version was actually a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] nation and the Imperial Army's insignia was a Nazi Swastika with a thunderbolt behind it. In the English version, the Nazis are referred as the "Badds", though the backstory in its manual refers to them as the "Nazz".<ref name="NES manual"/>{{rp|4}}<ref name="IGN Rearmed preview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/17/bionic-commando-rearmed-preview|title=Bionic Commando Rearmed Preview|last=Robinson|first=Martin|date=January 17, 2008|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=July 22, 2018}}</ref> The Imperial Army's Swastika insignia was changed into a new one resembling [[Reichsadler|an eagle]]; and the leader of the villains, originally called Weizmann in the Japanese version,<ref name="Top Secret manual"/>{{rp|4}} was renamed Killt, although the soldiers and characters keep their same Nazi-like appearance. The difficulty of the game was rebalanced and some of the areas were made less difficult.<ref>{{cite web|author=Elite Coder|date=|url=http://www.elitecoder.com/bionic/famiver.html|title=Bionic Commando Famicom Version|accessdate=}}</ref>

One of the most prominent differences is the identity of the ultimate antagonist of the game, who is meant to be a revived [[Adolf Hitler in popular culture|Adolf Hitler]] in the Japanese version. For the English version, the character was renamed "Master-D", however his appearance remained the same.<ref name="IGN Rearmed preview" /> There is a gory ending sequence in which Hitler's face explodes, which was also kept intact in the English version.<ref>Sandvik, Per Arne (November 15, 2002) [http://encyclopedia-obscura.com/gameshorror.html The Horror!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703075819/http://www.encyclopedia-obscura.com/gameshorror.html |date=July 3, 2013 }} Encyclopedia Obscura. Retrieved on July 9, 2008</ref>

===Music===
The music for the game was created by video game music composer Junko Tamiya, who was credited under the pseudonym "Gondamin".<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Bionic Commando "The Soundtrack" |date=2009 |publisher=[[Sumthing Else Music Works]]}}</ref> Two songs from the Arcade versions are used in some areas. The music for the original arcade game was developed by [[Harumi Fujita]]. Tamiya adapted two of the original arcade tracks (The "Bionic Commando Theme" and "The Powerplant") and expanded the soundtrack by adding several more new songs in the console versions for the Japanese Famicom and the NES versions.<ref name="Tamiya"/>

==Legacy==
===Remakes and re-releases===
A [[Bionic Commando (Game Boy)|portable adaptation]] of ''Bionic Commando'' was released for the [[Game Boy]] in [[1992 in video gaming|1992]]. The Game Boy version is based on the NES game, featuring the same gameplay and stages, and a similar plot, but changes the present day setting into a futuristic one. A second remake, ''[[Bionic Commando Rearmed]]'', was developed by [[GRIN (company)|GRIN]] and released in [[2008 in video gaming|2008]] as a downloadable game for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

The NES version was re-released as one of three NES games in the [[Game Boy Advance]] compilation ''Capcom Classics Mini-Mix'', along with ''[[Strider (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Strider]]'' and ''[[Mighty Final Fight]]''.

===Novelization===
The game was [[novelized]] as ''Bionic Commando'' by J. B. Stamper as part of the ''[[Worlds of Power]]'' series of novels based on the NES version. The main character is identified as Jack Markson, who loses an arm when ninjas attack his hotel room and kidnap Super Joe. The Federation replaces his missing limb with a bionic arm that has a grappling hook and a number of other gadgets that are not featured in the game, like a flame thrower and a device that forces prisoners to tell the truth. Like most books in the series, violence was toned down to non-lethality in most cases (he usually shoots enemy soldiers with tranquilizers), although certain events, like the deaths of Hal and Killt, are kept. Much of the game's middle is skimmed over in order to fit it all into the book.
