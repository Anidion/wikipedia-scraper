'''''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom''''' is an [[action game]] released in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is based on the [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985 video game)|arcade game]] and [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|film]] of the same name. The resulting product differed from the arcade version in several aspects, but kept the same underlying premise and style.

The game was originally released by [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]] in December 1988. The publishing rights reverted to [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] the following year and it announced plans to re-release the game that October.<ref name="tgrl">{{cite magazine|title=Tengen Announces New Games for NES|magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]]|volume=8|issue=7|publisher=Computer Entertainer|date=October 1989|page=10}}</ref> ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' gives the player control of Indiana Jones as he makes his way through the temple in a series of 12 levels or "waves". In the final wave, the player must defeat the villain of the film, Mola Ram, on a rope bridge that recreates the final scene in the movie. Reception of the game was generally negative.

==Version history==
The [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|film version]] of ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' was released in 1984 and starred [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]. A year later, in 1985, [[Atari Games]] capitalized on the franchise by releasing the initial version of the game on [[video game arcade cabinet|arcade machine]]. This version was a [[platform game|platform]] and [[fighting game]] and featured [[theme music]] and sound clips from the actual film. The game takes place over three zones that are based on the movie's plot, where the objective is to free the slave children and recover the Sankara stones.<ref name="Raider2">{{cite web | last = MF | title = Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom | publisher = The Raider.net | url = http://www.theraider.net/information/videogames/templeofdoom_atari.php | access-date = 2009-02-06}}</ref> This version was also the first translated from any of the movies in the Indiana Jones series into an arcade game, although ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (video game)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]] and ''[[Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom]]'' for the [[Commodore 64]] had come out in [[1982 in video gaming|1982]] and [[1985 in video gaming|1985]] respectively.<ref name="Raider3">{{cite web | last = MF | title = Indiana Jones Video Games | publisher = The Raider.net | url = http://www.theraider.net/information/videogames/index.php | access-date = 2009-02-06}}</ref><ref name="Raider">{{cite web | last = MF | title = Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom | publisher = The Raider.net | url = http://www.theraider.net/information/videogames/templeofdoom_tengen.php | access-date = 2009-02-06}}</ref> ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' satisfied both of these categories.

Aside from the original arcade version, in 1987 ports were released for the Atari ST, Commodore 64 (completely independent ports for NTSC and PAL regions), [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and MSX. The Nintendo Entertainment System had two separate editions of the ''Temple of Doom'' game. The first version was released by Mindscape in December 1988 in the form of a standard Nintendo cartridge. The second version, released by Tengen after the rights reverted from Mindscape,<ref name="tgrl"/> came in a black cartridge that was different from Nintendo's traditional grey color format. By this point, Tengen had split from Nintendo and was releasing unlicensed games that attempted to circumvent the need for a [[10NES]] lockout chip.<ref name="Raider"/> Nintendo filed suit and Tengen lost, forcing it to remove its NES games from the market.<ref name="Player">{{cite web|last = Kent|first = Steven|title = Lawsuit: ATARI GAMES CORP. and TENGEN, INC.

There are several differences between the arcade game and its console adaptation. In the original arcade version, the Sankara Stones were not all found in one location at the end of a wave. Instead, Jones had to travel through a [[temple]] every two rounds. In addition, the entire style of play is different and bestows upon the player more weapons and items for Jones to collect from the slave children he frees. Jones was also unable to jump in previous incarnations of the game.<ref name="Raider"/>

==Plot and gameplay==
[[Image:ITJDWave8.png|200px|thumb|left|The Sankara Stones in Wave 9.]] 
The plot of the NES version follows the storyline of the original film. At the onset of the game, Jones has just reached the Pankot Palace featured in the movie and is preparing to free the slave children, recover the missing Sankara Stones and defeat [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Mola Ram|Mola Ram]] and his [[Thuggee]] entourage.<ref name="Vimm">{{cite web | title = NES Manuals: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom | publisher = Vimm's Lair | date = August 2, 2000 | url = http://vimm.net/manual/manual.php?system=NES&title=IndianaJonesTempleDoom&destDPI=95 | access-date = 2007-10-07}}</ref> The game differs from the original arcade version in many respects, including the layout and the manner in which one progresses through the game, but the plot remains unchanged in both versions.<ref name="Raider"/>

The player advances through 12 levels (called "waves"), the first nine of which require Jones to travel through the palace and recover the Sankara Stones. In these stages, the player may restart the game with all items intact in the last area reached. Afterwards, if the player dies, they must return to the Chamber of [[Kali]] (Wave 9) and finish the game from that point. Each level also has a [[timer]] that goes from 99 to zero. If time runs out, the player is confronted by Mola Ram and loses one life and all of their items. All levels also contain mine cart rooms, where Jones can ride the rails through the levels across hazards and past enemies.<ref name="Vimm"/>

Wave 9 requires the player to cross a river of [[lava]] by stunning the monsters that live there. Once across, Jones must grab the Sankara Stones to progress to the Map Room where he can use the map pieces he has collected to figure out where the secret door exit is in Wave 10. Alternatively, there is a secret [[cult image|idol]] in Wave 8 that will reveal the hidden exit. To pass requires the use of both TNT and the Sankara Stones. Wave 11 leads to the exit and Wave 12 recreates the scene with the [[rope bridge]] and the final battle with Mola Ram.<ref name="Vimm"/>

The game contains a variety of elements that both aid and hinder the player's progress through the waves. At his disposal, Jones has TNT, guns, swords, [[Fedora|hats]] for extra lives, jewels for extra time and his classic [[whip]]. Opposing him are bats, rats, snakes, spiders and an endless supply of Thugee servants. In addition, if Jones lands in any of the lava pits, crashes a mine cart or hits a boulder or spike trap, he loses one life.<ref name="Vimm"/>

==Reception==
Although hyped up in ''[[Nintendo Power]]''<nowiki/>'s "Video Shorts" section as an upcoming release,<ref name="Power">{{cite magazine|magazine = [[Nintendo Power]]|title = Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom from MINDSCAPE|author = Nintendo Power Staff|issue = 2|date=Septemberâ€“October 1988|pages = 79|publisher = [[Nintendo]]}}</ref> ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' met with generally negative reception. Aside from the difficulty level of the game, the official reviewer for the Indiana Jones fan community ''TheRaider.net'' noted that Jones' new jumping ability is glitchy, causing him to leap downwards no matter which direction he is facing, unless the player is holding down the button for the particular direction in which they want to jump. Also cited as flaws are poor controls, unappealing graphics, the number of enemies, and the text-only ending screen. The reviewer admitted, however, that the game's "respectable attempt to preserve [[John Williams]]' musical [[Film score|score]]" was one of its only highlights.<ref name="Raider"/> The original arcade version was the first Atari System 1 game to talk to the players using speech capability, a feature lacking in the console version due to the limitations of the hardware. The arcade game, like the console adaptation, obtained its theme music (as well as sound effects that were absent on the NES version) from the film itself.<ref name="Raider2"/>

Skyler Miller, a reviewer at [[Allgame]] who compared the console adaptation to the original game, admitted that the graphics are "recognizable", but claims that the version was "missing much of the original's detail and character."<ref name="Allgame"/> Miller's final judgment was to call it "a passable effort" and to compare unfavourably to the arcade version.<ref name="Allgame"/> Edward J. Semrad, a contemporary technical writer and computer specialist with the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' included the game in his list of games that were "watered-down versions of what we see in the arcades" and praised the PC version for its superiority.<ref name="Semrad">{{Cite news | last = Semrad | first = Edward J. | title = Games are getting better, tougher | newspaper = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | pages = 4G | date = 1988-12-17}}</ref>
