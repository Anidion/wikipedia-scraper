''Savage'' is a three-part game; the first part is side-scrolling level with a muscular hero warrior fighting his way in a castle dungeon; the second is a 3D into-the-screen action sequence where the player has to shoot targets while avoiding monstrous stone heads; the third level a bird has to find its way in a 2d scrolling maze, collect four keys and reach the exit.

The story is a [[swords and sorcery]] fantasy, with the muscular hero in the end rescuing his 'maiden love' from the clutches of the "Dark Guardian".

==Reception==

Nick Bruty spoke on the reception of the game stating "The reviews definitely seemed positive, but sales-wise I don't think it did that well. I hated the marketing campaign - the print ads, They had this weedy little school kid becoming Savage, and I think they really just focused on the game itself. So there was this big thing 'Savage' - a colour, full-on, [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]-on-steroids game, and then we got this weedy, black and white advert. Everything about it sucked the life out of me."<ref>https://www.pressreader.com/uk/retro-gamer/20180614/281526521747853</ref>

''[[Your Sinclair]]'' awarded the game 9 out of 10,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/savage.htm|magazine=Your Sinclair|title=Savage review|issue=36|date=December 1988}}</ref> praising the detailed and colourful graphics achieved with the Spectrum.

The Commodore 64/128 version of the game was reviewed in 1990 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #155 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. The reviewers complimented the game, stating, "''Savage'' is one of the best C64/128 arcade games we’ve played lately. Especially of note is the game's music, which is of extraordinarily high quality. The graphic sprites are well designed, and play is fast." They concluded the review by saying, "Yes, ''Savage'' is savage—on both your joystick palm and fire-button finger. If you aren’t quick, you’re dead. [...] ''Savage'' is a very good arcade/fantasy game and is well named!"<ref name="Dragon155">{{cite journal
