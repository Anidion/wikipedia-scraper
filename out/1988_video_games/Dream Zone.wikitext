'''''Dream Zone''''' is an [[adventure game]] developed by [[Naughty Dog|JAM Software]] and published by Baudville. It was released in 1988 for the [[Apple II]] and [[Apple IIGS]], followed by versions for [[MS-DOS]], the [[Amiga]], and the [[Atari ST]].

==Plot==
''Dream Zone'' is a game in which an elixir from a scientist traps the player in his own imaginary dream world of terrifying creatures, magic, airships, a floating castle, and an infuriating bureaucracy, that he must escape to return to reality.<ref name="Dragon134"/>

==Reception==
''[[Compute!]]'' stated that the game "truly conveys a dream-like feeling". The magazine praised its satire and the IIGS version's graphics, and stated that "it's hard to believe that the program was written by two high school juniors".<ref name="trunzo198805">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_096_1988_May#page/n65/mode/2up | title=Dream Zone | work=Compute! | date=May 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Trunzo, James V. | pages=65}}</ref> A later ''Compute!'' review praised the graphics, story, and interface.<ref name="addams198910">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-10-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_113_1989_Oct#page/n111/mode/2up | title=Nightmare on Game Street | work=Compute! | date=October 1989 | accessdate=11 November 2013 | author=Addams, Shay | pages=110}}</ref> The game was reviewed in 1988 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #134 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column.
