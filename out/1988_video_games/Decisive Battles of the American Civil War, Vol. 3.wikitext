==Reception==
Joe Sherfy reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "DBACW Volume III is successful because it stresses realism without sacrificing playability. DBACW has brought it all together with a highly playable game which allows the player to determine which variables are most important. While I would recommend that the uninitiated start with Volume I or II of DBACW, the third volume is a must for anyone with a genuine interest in the war or who simply likes a tough challenge."<ref name="CGW57">{{cite magazine |last=Sherfy |first=Joe |title=The End of the War |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |date=March 1989 |volume=1 |issue=57 |pages=4|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_57/page/n3/mode/2up|issn=0744-6667}}</ref>
