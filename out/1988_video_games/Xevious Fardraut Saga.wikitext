{{nihongo foot|'''''Xevious: Fardraut Saga'''''|ゼビウス ファードラウト{{ruby|伝説|サーガ}}|Zebiusu Fādorauto Sāga|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1988 vertically [[scrolling shooter]] video game published by [[Namco]] for the [[MSX2]] in Japan. An updated [[PC Engine]] version was released two years later. The fifth entry in the ''[[List of Xevious media|Xevious]]'' franchise, the player controls a spaceship in its mission to vanquish the Xevious forces before its supercomputer leader GAMP wipes out the entirety of mankind. The player uses two weapons, an air zapper to destroy air-based enemies, and a blaster bomb to destroy ground-based enemies.

''Fardraut Saga'' was part of Namco's attempt to bring the ''Xevious'' series back into popularity, after games such as ''[[Gradius]]'' began winning over players in arcades. Their previous attempt, ''[[Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo]]'', was widely-disliked by fans and a commercial flop. Instead of being produced in-house, Namco enlisted the help of Japanese studio [[Compile (company)|Compile]], known for creating the ''[[Puyo Puyo]]'', ''[[Zanac]]'', and ''[[Aleste]]'' series, to develop it. Production was led by Compile founder Masamitsu "Moo" Mitani. The MSX2 was chosen as the platform to produce the game on due to Compile having previously developed many games for it.

''Fardraut Saga'' received mixed reviews. Critics focused primarily on the game's high difficulty and average graphics, along with it lacking replay value and having poor music and sound effects. The inclusion of the original ''[[Xevious]]'' and its new gameplay mechanics had received praise. It was followed by the 3D spin-off ''[[Solvalou]]'' in arcades in 1991.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Xevious Fardraut Saga screenshot.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of the PC Engine version.]]
In the MSX2 version, players can select between two modes at the title screen: "Recon", a port of the original ''Xevious''; and "Scramble", which is a new 16-area game with new enemies, new boss battles as well as the Andor Genesis, and four ships (Solvalou, Solgrado, Zeodalley, and Gampmission). The two modes are renamed to "Arcade" and "Fardraut" in the PC Engine version. However, Fardraut is a bit different from the original Scramble: it is a 4-stage game with new enemies and a different ship on each level. At the end of each level, a boss battle which is similar to the Andor Genesis will be at the end of each level. Before each level players will be given a dialogue of the story that is given in the game.

==Development and release==
The arcade game ''[[Xevious]]'', developed by [[Namco]] and released in 1983, received widespread acclaim from players and critics for its genre-defining gameplay mechanics and mysterious, cohesive world.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Savorelli |first1=Carlo |title=Xevious |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/xevious/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=31 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920143717/http://eb.archive.org |archive-date=20 September 2019 |date=6 May 2015}}</ref> It became a platinum seller on the Nintendo [[Family Computer]], selling over one million copies and jumping console sales by a near two-million units.<ref>{{cite web |title=Japan Platinum Game Chart |url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-JPPlatinum.shtml |website=The Magic Box |access-date=23 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801030711/http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-JPPlatinum.shtml |archive-date=1 August 2019}}</ref><ref name="usedgame07">{{Cite magazine |author = 遠藤昭宏 |title = ユーゲーが贈るファミコン名作ソフト100選 アクション部門 |date = June 2003 |publisher = キルタイムコミュニケーション |magazine = ユーゲー |issue = 7 |pages = 6–12 }}</ref> By the mid-1980s the game's popularity had significantly died down, as titles like ''[[Gradius]]'' began to win over players with their larger scope and longetivity.<ref name="usedgame07"/> Despite opposition of [[Masanobu Endo]], the creator of the original, Namco decided to create a sequel to ''Xevious'' for the Famicom as a way to bring the game back into popularity.<ref name="HG101 GAMP">{{cite web |last1=Savorelli |first1=Carlo |title=Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/super-xevious-gamp-no-nazo/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=10 December 2013}}</ref> It received mixed reviews, was widely-disliked by fans for its radical departure from the original, and was commercially unsuccessful.<ref name="HG101 GAMP"/>

For their next attempt at reviving the series, Namco decided to produce a sequel that closely followed the original while still building on its core mechanics. Rather than producing the game entirely in-house, Namco enlisted the help of [[Compile (company)|Compile]], a Japanese studio known for series such as ''[[Puyo Puyo]]'', ''[[Aleste]]'', and ''[[Zanac]]'', but they are not specifically credited in the game itself.<ref name="HG101"/> Compile previously worked with Namco on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version of Nihon Falcom's ''[[Legacy of the Wizard]]'', which Namco published in Japan and Compile assisted in production of it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Legacy of the Wizard |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/legacy-of-the-wizard/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=31 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906094913/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/legacy-of-the-wizard/ |archive-date=6 September 2019 |date=25 July 2017}}</ref> Production was led by Masamitsu "Moo" Niitani, the founder of Compile and a designer for ''Zanac''.<ref name="HG101"/> ''Fardraut Saga'' was designed for the [[MSX2]] computer, as Compile had previously developed many games for it and as such had a clear grasp on its hardware. Some of the game's enemies were named by Moo after Compile's own employees and previous titles, including one named after himself.<ref name="HG101"/> The game's box art, featuring 3D computer-generated models of the Solvalou and Andor Genesis, were taken from a CGI short film that Namco produced in 1988. Namco published ''Fardraut Saga'' on December 23, 1988 in Japan.

===Fardraut Densetsu===
On June 29, 1990, a [[PC Engine]] version of ''Fardraut Saga'' was published, sometimes referred to as ''Xevious: Fardraut Densetsu'' to distinguish itself from the MSX2 version.<ref name="Famitsu"/> Compile previously teased the game in the ending for the MSX release, originally subtitled ''Episode 2: Final Weapon''.<ref name="HG101"/> Rather than simply being a remake of the MSX2 game, the PC Engine version boasts several new additions, such as a new four-level campaign and different power-up items. It is believed that the game is heavily-based on ''Fardraut'', a novel written by Masanobu Endo himself that documents the world of ''Xevious'' and the story behind it.

In a retrospective review, ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' applauded the game's visuals for being superior to the original, while also saying its music was much more "dramatic" compared to the first game.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Savorelli |first1=Carlo |title=Xevious: Fardraut Saga |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/xevious-fardraut-saga/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=22 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413192351/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/xevious-fardraut-saga/ |archive-date=13 April 2019 |date=10 December 2013}}</ref>
