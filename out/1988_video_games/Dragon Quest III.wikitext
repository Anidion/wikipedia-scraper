'''''Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation''''',{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Dragon Quest III: Soshite Densetsu e...'''''|ドラゴンクエストIII そして伝説へ...|lead=yes}}.}} titled '''''Dragon Warrior III''''' when initially localized to North America, is a 1988 [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Chunsoft]] and published by [[Enix]]. It is the third installment in the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series and was first released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (Famicom) in Japan and later for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in North America.

The first three ''Dragon Quest'' games are part of the same story, and ''Dragon Warrior III'' is the first game chronologically, as well as the third game that features the hero [[Dragon Quest#Erdrick|Erdrick]] (Loto in the Japanese releases and Game Boy Color localization). The story follows "the Hero" who is tasked with saving the world from the archfiend Baramos. Gathering a group of companions into a party, the Hero must travel the world, stopping at various towns and locations, and make their way to the Demon Lord Baramos' lair.

== Gameplay ==
''Dragon Quest III'' is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the original ''[[Dragon Quest (video game)|Dragon Quest]]'' and ''[[Dragon Quest II]]''. The game uses basic [[role-playing video game]] conventions such as leveling up by gaining [[experience point]]s and equipping items.<ref name="DWIIINES" /><ref name="DWIIIGBC" /> The battle system is [[turn-based strategy|turn-based]] like the other games in the series, though the remakes incorporate various interface changes from later titles. These include simpler door opening, a bag to store items instead of keeping them at a bank, quick item sorting with "Tidy Item" and "Tidy Bag" command, and a "Full HP" command to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. And while earlier ''Dragon Quest'' games were [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]] in structure, ''Dragon Quest III'' featured an even more [[Open world|open-world]] experience. It also allowed the player to freely swap characters in and out of their party and introduced the day/night cycle in which certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at specific times of the day.<ref name="DQ_III" /><ref name="gspot_consolehist_d" />

=== Classes ===
[[File:Dragonwarrior3class.png|240px|left|thumb|In the picture, the player is reselecting one class for a character in Dhama Temple. The class system became a staple feature of many future ''Dragon Quest'' games.]]
''Dragon Quest III'' features a [[Character class|class]] system, in which each character has a certain class. At the start of the game, the player begins as a single male or female hero but is able to recruit members at the local tavern.<ref name="kurt" /> While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose to be any of the following of either gender: Soldier (Warrior in the [[Game Boy Color|GBC]] version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn.<ref name="DWIIINES" /><ref name="DWIIIGBC" /><ref name="pgclasses" /> Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game.<ref name="explorer" /> A character who changes classes has their stats halved and restarts at experience Level 1, retaining their spells and, in the remakes, their personality. This allows a player to create a character that knows Wizard spells but has the defense of a Soldier.<ref name="kurt" /> Unlike most ''Dragon Quest'' parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits.<ref name="manual" /> Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles in order to win more gold.<ref name="pgminigames" />

In the remakes, after selecting a character, the player can change the character's starting abilities with five magical seeds, given at the tavern.<ref name="guide" /> Also, each character has a personality trait which affects the growth rate of their abilities. The Hero's personality is determined by the player's choices and actions during a dream sequence at the start of the game, while other characters' personalities are determined by their status at the end of the character generation process. Most personalities are available to both male and female characters, while a few are exclusive to male or female characters. A character's personality can be temporarily changed by equipping certain accessories, or permanently changed by using certain consumable books.

== Story ==
=== Setting ===
The game starts in the castle town of Aliahan. Like the rest of the ''Dragon Quest'' worlds, this castle is set in a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] time period, complete with [[knight]]s and [[magician (fantasy)|magicians]]. The party explores several caves, ruins, and castles during the adventure. The geography of ''Dragon Quest III'' largely corresponds to the actual geography of Earth,<ref name="kurt" /> and many towns correspond to their real-world cultures, including "Romaly" for [[Rome]], "Portoga" for [[Portugal]], "Assaram" near present-day [[Iraq]] (derived from "[[as-salamu alaykum]]"), "Jipang" for [[Japan]] (where the hero fights [[Yamata no Orochi]]) and even a "New Town" in eastern [[North America]] that experiences a revolution against an overbearing ruler (derived from the [[American Revolution]] against the [[United Kingdom]] in 1776).

=== Plot ===
''Dragon Quest III'' is set many years before the original ''Dragon Warrior'' in a world separate from the first two games.<ref name="brad" /> A wicked fiend named Baramos threatens to destroy the world.<ref name="king" /> The story revolves around the Hero,<ref name="DWIIINES" /> son or daughter (the player can choose to be either male or female, with few gameplay changes) of the legendary warrior Ortega.<ref name="king2" /> On their sixteenth birthday, the Hero is summoned to the castle and is given by the King of Aliahan the challenge to rid the world of the evil archfiend Baramos, which Ortega attempted in the past but seemingly perished in a volcano.<ref name="handbook" /> The Hero then is able to recruit up to three traveling companions to help fight Baramos.

The Hero leaves their home country of Aliahan to travel the world and complete their father's quest to defeat Baramos. A major portion of the adventure is the quest to acquire the last two of the three keys needed to open doors throughout the game. After saving two people of the town of Baharata from the rogue Kandar and stealing back the King of Romaly's crown, the Hero receives Black Pepper, which they then trade for a sailing ship at Portoga.<ref name="handbook2" /><ref name="story" /> With the ship, the Hero acquires the Final Key and the six mystical orbs which are used to revive the legendary bird Ramia.<ref name="handbook4" /> Ramia allows the Hero and their party to travel to Baramos' castle, which is surrounded by mountains.<ref name="handbook5" />

After defeating Baramos in a ferocious battle and returning to Aliahan, the Hero's celebration is cut off as Zoma, Baramos's master and the game's true villain, reveals his existence. He attacks and opens a pit to the Dark World, which the Hero jumps into.<ref name="handbook6" /> The Dark World is, in fact, Alefgard (of the previous installments of the series), where the Hero must acquire several of the artifacts that were collected in the original ''[[Dragon Quest (video game)|Dragon Quest]]'', including the Sun Stone and the Rain Staff.<ref name="story" /> Rubiss, a legendary sage, has been turned to stone and is rescued by the Hero, and the Hero receives the Sacred Amulet in return.<ref name="handbook7" /> These items, as in the original game, create the Rainbow Bridge which leads the Hero to Zoma's castle for the final confrontation. Along the way, the Hero briefly reunites with Ortega as he is slain by Zoma's monsters, then continues on to defeat the revived Baramos, now turned into the powerful Baramos Bomus and later into the skeletal Baramos Gonus. With the Ball of Light given by the Dragon Queen, the Hero defeats Zoma and frees Alefgard, but Zoma boasts that evil will eventually return to the land and the Hero will not live long enough to stop it.<ref name="handbook8" /> For their bravery, the Hero receives the title of "Erdrick" ("Loto" in the Japanese version). The Hero later vanishes from Alefgard, leaving their sword and armor to be passed down throughout the ages so that their descendants can continue to protect the world from evil.

== Development ==
As with the other main games in the ''Dragon Quest'' series, ''Dragon Quest III''{{'}}s scenario was designed by [[Yuji Horii]],<ref name="imdb2" /> whereas the artwork was done by [[Akira Toriyama]], of ''[[Dragon Ball (franchise)|Dragon Ball]]'' fame.<ref name="imdb3" /> [[Koichi Sugiyama]] composed all the music for ''Dragon Quest III''.<ref name="imdb" /> Chunsoft president [[Koichi Nakamura]], co-creator of ''Dragon Quest'', stated he contributed about "10%" of the games programming.<ref name="cocreator" /> The game was released a year after the original, a longer period of development than its predecessor, and reflected the ever-lengthening game development process of the series.<ref name="originate2" /> Yuji Horii, in a 1989 interview, said that developers had perfected the series' game structure in ''Dragon Quest III'', and this was reflected by the transition from one character's quest to a party of heroes.<ref name="originate" /> The password system used on the first two ''Dragon Quest'' titles was dropped in favor of a save slot due in part to Horii's dislike of the long codes that players needed to memorize or record .<ref name="originate" /> Horii had a policy of removing any features from his games that had been used elsewhere, which turned out to be unworkable during ''Dragon Quest III''s development when the game's world map concept was used first by another game maker in ''Mirai Shinwa Jarvas'', but Horii's team was too far into development to change anything.<ref name="delete"/> Horii also preferred a silent protagonist to make the player feel like they have become the main character, but at one point in the story, Horii was forced to make the hero shout, "Leave him to us! Run! Quick!"<ref name="delete"/>

=== 1991 North American localization ===
The game was localized in North America as ''Dragon Warrior III'' in 1991 (though not officially released until 1992). Several changes were made in this version. Among them were the addition of a new title sequence (in the original, it was on a simple black screen with the title of the game in the center), and a new prologue which depicted Ortega, who also was given a brand new sprite in this version, fighting a Dragon, and being dragged into the volcano (in the original, the player was unaware of Ortega's fate, until talking to the King for the first time). There were also brand new music cues, including one for the title sequence, and one that played after a non-player character death late in the game. To accompany the localization credits, the ending theme was extended to include a reprise of the Alefgard theme. It is unclear whether Sugiyama was brought back to score these new tracks, or someone else was brought in. The menu when starting a new or old save file also added the menu music from ''[[Dragon Quest IV]]'' (in the original, the menu was silent). Finally, most of the monsters were given a boost in experience points.

[[File:DWIII.png|upright=1.3636364|thumb|A comparison of graphics from the Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy Color versions, showing the hero outside of Aliahan]]
The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] version, released in late 1996, during the last days of the Super NES in North America, was never brought to North America, due to [[Enix America Corporation]]'s closure in 1995. By the time Enix of America returned, the SNES had been discontinued in North America. However, the next remake, for the [[Game Boy Color]], was released in both Japan and the US.

The Game Boy Color version is based on the Super Famicom version. For the North American release of the ''Dragon Quest III'' Game Boy Color remake, Enix decided to give the packaging an [[anime]] feel, due to fan demand on Enix's message boards.<ref name="adult" /> Both remake versions of ''Dragon Quest III'' offer many new features and changes. The game received a new translation, incorporating many adult elements that were cut from its original American release, and becoming the first Game Boy Color RPG with a "Teen" rating.<ref name="adult" /> It was also the largest Game Boy Color game released in North America {{Citation needed|reason=Dragon's Lair GBC may match this|date=October 2022}}, with 32 Mb [[Read-only memory|ROM]] and 256Kb of save-state [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] on one cartridge.<ref name="previewgame" /> A new class, the Thief, was added to the roster in each of the remakes. Many of the names of the classes were changed in the English localization of the Game Boy Color version, such as Soldier to Warrior. Also, in the new versions was the ability to change into the Jester class at Dhama, which was not allowed in the original.<ref name="DWIIINES" /><ref name="DWIIIGBC" /><ref name="pgclasses" /> New mini-games were added to the remakes, including Pachisi (called Suguroku in Japan / Treasures and Trapdoors as of the ''Dragon Quest V'' remake), which is a giant [[board game]] style adventure from which the player can win items.<ref name="pgminigames" /> This game is based on Horii's series ''[[Fortune Street|Itadaki Street]]''.<ref name="ign" /> The Mini Medal system, which lets players collect hidden medals to gain new items, seen in later ''Dragon Quest'' games (it originated in ''[[Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen|Dragon Quest IV]]''), was added.<ref name="pgminigames" /> Another medal system, Monster Medals, lets players collect medals from fallen enemies, was added in Game Boy Color remake, and two players could trade Monster Medals via a [[Game Link Cable]].<ref name="cable" /> Two bonus dungeons become available after the main quest is over. The remakes feature updated graphics.<ref name="ign" /> An overhauled introduction for the game was made, similar to the one in the original ''Dragon Quest III'', which included Ortega's battle with the Dragon Queen. Monster and attack animation in battles were added,<ref name="brad" /> a feature first introduced in ''[[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation|Dragon Quest VI]]''.<ref name="animatedbattle" /> A personality system was added to the remakes of ''Dragon Quest III''. A pre-game sequence in which the player answers moral dilemmas similar to that in ''[[Ultima IV]]'' determines the Hero's personality. The personality of the other members of the party is determined by the stat-raising seeds that the player gives them during the character generation process. Personalities determine which stats increase when a character levels up.<ref name="instructions" /> The personalities may be changed by use of special items and books.

Square Enix released both the Famicom and Super Famicom versions of ''Dragon Quest III'' in Japan on September 15, 2011, as part of ''Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Collection Famicom & Super Famicom Dragon Quest I & II & III'', a compilation of emulated ''Dragon Quest'' games for the [[Wii]] to celebrate the series' 25th anniversary.<ref name="siliconerawii" /> A quick save feature was added to these versions, allowing for pauses at any time, but the save file is deleted upon resuming.<ref name="quicksave" /> At the Dragon Quest 35th Anniversary Livestream, a remake of ''Dragon Quest III'' was announced in the "HD-2D" style of games like ''[[Octopath Traveler]]'' and ''[[Triangle Strategy]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oloman |first1=Jordan |title=Dragon Quest 3 Is Being Remade in the Style of Octopath Traveler |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-remake-octopath-traveler |website=IGN |date=27 May 2021 |access-date=27 May 2021}}</ref> which has since then been announced to be releasing on November 14, 2024.

=== Music ===
[[Koichi Sugiyama]] composed and directed the music for the game.

The Game Boy Color remake received very good reviews from critics.
