{{nihongo|'''''Super Thunder Blade'''''|スーパーサンダーブレード}} is a [[combat flight simulation]] [[shooter game]] developed and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] console. It was one of the two launch titles for the console in Japan (the other one being ''[[Space Harrier II]]''), as well as being one of the six launch titles for the console for its U.S. launch.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=Lucas |title=Super Thunder Blade Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/20/super-thunder-blade-review |website=IGN |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=25 June 2020}}</ref> It is a follow-up to the 1987 [[arcade game]] ''[[Thunder Blade]]''.

It was later released for the [[Virtual Console]] on September 17, 2007. It was also included in the ''[[Sega Genesis Collection]]'' for [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2007 and in ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]].

==Gameplay==
As in its predecessor, the player takes control of a helicopter which is used to attack a group of guerrillas. The helicopter itself uses guns and missiles, and can also air brake. A distinctive feature that also appears in the arcade game is the use of different viewpoints during the entire game; during normal gameplay and when fighting sub-bosses, the game utilizes a third-person perspective from behind the helicopter, similar to ''[[Space Harrier]]'', but the camera changes to a top-down perspective when fighting bosses. ''Super Thunder Blade'' had four stages of play.

==Reception==
The game received positive reviews upon release. ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' magazine rated it 880 out of 1000 and listed it as one of the top five best games available for the Mega Drive in 1989.<ref name="ACE">{{cite magazine |title=Console Wars |magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]] |date=October 1989 |issue=26 (November 1989) |page=144 |url=https://archive.org/details/ace-magazine-26/page/n143}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' rated it 80% and called it the "best version" of ''Thunder Blade'' on "any" system.<ref name="CVG">{{cite journal |title=Complete Games Guide |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref>

The game later received mixed retrospective reviews in the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Super Thunder Blade |url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/genesis/586510-super-thunder-blade |website=GameFAQs |accessdate=25 June 2020}}</ref> In 2007, ''[[IGN]]'' gave the game a 4 out of 10, citing a framerate that was "far too jumpy" and lamenting that the game "just couldn't make the jump to console" from its arcade cabinet counterpart.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=Lucas |title=Super Thunder Blade Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/20/super-thunder-blade-review |website=IGN |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=25 June 2020}}</ref>

== Other versions ==
''Super Thunder Blade'' is the title of the Mega Drive release. This was done to differentiate it from the [[Master System]] release, known as ''Thunder Blade'', which was a port from the arcade version. There were few differences between the arcade and Mega Drive versions, save for some minor level development changes and the gameplay; the initial top-down sections (occurring before the third-person sections) were omitted from the Mega Drive version.
