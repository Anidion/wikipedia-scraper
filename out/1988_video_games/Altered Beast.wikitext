'''''Altered Beast'''''{{efn|{{nihongo||{{ruby|獣王記|じゅうおうき}}|Jūōki|"Beast King's Chronicle"}}}} is a 1988 [[beat 'em up]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Sega]]. The game is set in [[Ancient Greece]] and follows a player character chosen by [[Zeus]] to rescue his daughter [[Athena]] from the demonic ruler of the [[underworld]], Neff. Through the use of [[power-up]]s, the player character can assume the form of different magical beasts (wolf, dragon, bear, tiger, and golden wolf). It was ported to several home [[video game console]]s and [[home computer]]s. It was the [[pack-in game]] for the [[Mega Drive]] when that system launched in 1988.

The game was developed by [[Makoto Uchida (game developer)|Makoto Uchida]], who developed the game as his first project as a lead developer. Uchida and his team used the [[List of Sega arcade system boards|System 16]] [[arcade system board]] for its graphical capabilities with [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. ''Altered Beast'' was ported numerous times in addition to its Genesis conversion, including for the [[Master System]] by Sega and to several computer systems and video game consoles by various third parties.

''Altered Beast''{{'}}s arcade release and its various ports have all received mixed reviews, mainly targeting the game's gameplay and graphics. The game has been re-released several times for various consoles and as part of video game compilations, and two sequels to the game have been developed.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:altbeastplay.png|thumb|left|A single player fighting against the undead in the first level of the arcade version]]

''Altered Beast'' is a [[side-scrolling video game|side scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] game with light [[platform game|platform]] elements. It has five levels and can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Combat takes place across five levels set in [[Ancient Greece]] and populated by aggressive [[undead]] creatures and monsters resembling those from Greek mythology. The demonic god Neff waits at the end of each level. Between each level are small animations giving the player glimpses of Athena's peril.<ref name="ag2">{{Cite web|last=Sutyak|first=Jonathan|title=Altered Beast - Overview - SMS|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1766|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114111239/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1766|archive-date=November 14, 2014|access-date=February 6, 2020|website=[[AllGame]]}}</ref><ref name="ag3">{{Cite web|last=Marriott|first=Scott Alan|title=Altered Beast - Overview - Genesis|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=66|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114131331/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=66|archive-date=November 14, 2014|access-date=February 6, 2020|website=[[AllGame]]}}</ref> Players can punch, kick and jump.<ref name="ag1">{{Cite web|last=Dean|first=Michael W.|title=Altered Beast - Overview - Arcade|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9491|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114131403/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9491|archive-date=November 14, 2014|access-date=February 6, 2020|website=[[AllGame]]}}</ref>

The game's premise is that Neff, ruler of the [[Greek underworld|underworld]], captures the goddess [[Athena]]. Angry, her father, the Olympian god [[Zeus]], decides to choose a champion to save her. Respecting the bravery of [[Centurion|Roman Centurions]], Zeus resurrects one of them and empowers him as a champion. The game's player character is the resurrected Roman Centurion, given extra power by Zeus so they can battle Neff and his supernatural minions.<ref name=":1">{{Cite magazine|last=Bevan|first=Mike|date=January 2014|title=The Making Of: Altered Beast|url=https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_124#page/46/mode/2up|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=124|pages=46–49}}</ref> In the original arcade game, the end credits include the revelation that the whole game actually depicted a staged film production.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Ken |title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |year=2018 |isbn=9781476631967 |pages=134–136}}</ref>

Whenever a player defeats a white [[Orthrus|two-headed wolf]], a Spirit Ball [[power-up]] appears. Each obtained Spirit Ball increases the player character's strength and size. Collecting three Spirit Balls allows the player character to transform into a powerful beast form, increasing their combat abilities before having to face Neff at the end of the level. The player character's beast forms include a [[European dragon|weredragon]], a werebear, a weretiger, a [[werewolf]], or a golden werewolf. Each beast form grants its own abilities. The dragon can unleash lightning bolts and an electric barrier, the bear has a petrifying breath that turns enemies into stone, the tiger can throw fireballs in a zig-zag pattern, the wolf can throw direct, but weak fireballs and has a powerful thrust attack, while the golden werewolf has the same abilities as the wolf form but stronger. In the [[Famicom]] version of the game, available beast forms also include a shark, lion, and phoenix form.<ref name=":5">{{Cite magazine|date=July 1989|title=Altered Beast - Top Secret!|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_02/page/n67/mode/2up|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=2|page=67}}</ref>

== Development ==
''Altered Beast'' was developed by [[Makoto Uchida (game developer)|Makoto Uchida]].  He took inspiration for the game from ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]'' and the music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]",<ref name=":1" /> as well as movies by [[Ray Harryhausen]], and chose the Greek setting for the powerful characters he had in mind.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Stuart|first=Keith|title=Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Collected Works|publisher=Read-Only Memory|year=2014|isbn=9780957576810|location=London}}</ref> Uchida admitted that he struggled during production because it was his first game he developed, and so he leaned on his lead programmer to help create balance in the gameplay.<ref name=":1" />

One of Uchida's goals was to create flashy visuals that would surprise players, so he asked his lead artist to focus just on the player character's transformation sequences for one month. Additionally, he and his team used the [[List of Sega arcade system boards|System 16]] [[arcade system board]] for its ability to add great detail to large character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], as well as the visual effects it could provide, such as limbs flying off characters during combat.<ref name=":1" /> Uchida was not impressed by the initial concept art, so he worked with an artist to sketch out his specific ideas on character design. While the results of this were positive, Uchida's lead designer quit the team over this situation.<ref name=":2" /> ''Altered Beast'' includes [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] that are references to other System 16 titles ''[[Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars]]'' and ''[[Shinobi (1987 video game)|Shinobi]]'', as a nod to members on Uchida's team that had worked on those titles previously.<ref name=":1" />

There were planned features for the game that Uchida did not have the opportunity to implement, namely a pressure-sensitive button. Discussions took place but a deal could not be reached with the owner of the patent of the pressure-sensitive device over the small number to be ordered. The failure to secure the button meant that half of the planned character actions had to be removed. Uchida claims that the reduced complexity of the game caused by this caused players to tire of ''Altered Beast'' quickly. Despite this, Uchida was proud of the reactions he was getting from players during play testing.<ref name=":1" />

==Releases==
[[File:Sega-Mega-Drive-EU-Mk1-wController-FL.jpg|alt=A European PAL Mega Drive video game console with a controller|thumb|''Altered Beast'' became the pack-in title for the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America and the Mega Drive (pictured above) in Europe and Brazil.]]
Released in June 1988,<ref name=":0" /> ''Altered Beast''{{'s}} arcade version proved to be more popular overseas than it did in Japan.  As a result of its popularity, it was selected to be [[Porting|ported]] and made the [[pack-in game]] for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis and Mega Drive]] in North America and Europe. Uchida was not involved directly with either the Genesis or the [[Master System]] port, though he did give some advice and noted he was not worried about the Genesis port because its hardware was based on the System 16 arcade system board he used.  He had hoped to implement the pressure-sensitive button for the Genesis port, but could not due to tight development time and the lack of the button in Genesis hardware. Because ''Altered Beast'' was not the pack-in game in Japan, Uchida did not get to see his game included with the console. By the time he went to the US three years later, all of the available consoles instead included [[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']],<ref name=":1" /> which replaced ''Altered Beast'' in part over concerns the latter's themes of [[zombie]]s and magic were not popular in the [[Bible Belt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/04/21/ign-presents-the-history-of-sega?page=3|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|last=Fahs|first=Travis|date=April 21, 2009|website=[[IGN]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125144901/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/04/21/ign-presents-the-history-of-sega?page=3|archive-date=January 25, 2016|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref>

In addition to the Genesis and Master System, ''Altered Beast'' was ported to several platforms, including for [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]], PC Engine-CD, [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Amiga]]. Several of the conversions for European systems were completed by [[Activision]]. Certain differences are seen between the several versions of the game. Some of them, like the Master System version, were missing levels. Others provided additional beasts to mutate into, such as a humanoid lion, shark, and phoenix forms seen in the Famicom version, ported by Asmik.<ref name=":1" />

==Legacy==
Video game journalist Ken Horowitz stated that video gamers identify the "rise from your grave" opening from the game, whether they are fans of Sega's games or not. According to Horowitz, ''Altered Beast''{{'s}} biggest attraction is its charm, which was reduced in the modifications to the game's Genesis port, and has called the game "one of the more memorable concepts Sega conceived."<ref name=":0" /> Uchida has expressed surprise over the sustained popularity around his arcade games, stating "When I occasionally visit videogame arcades in the US, I still see people playing my ''Altered Beast'' and ''[[Golden Axe (video game)|Golden Axe]]'' games. It proves to me that, if the game is good, people will still pay good money to play it."<ref name=":1" />

===Sequels===
''Altered Beast'' has received two sequels. ''Altered Beast: Guardian of the Realms'', developed by [[3d6 Games]] and published by [[THQ]], is a 2002 sequel for [[Game Boy Advance]] in the style of the original arcade game. It adds new features like power-ups and beast forms, as well as 15 levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/12/12/altered-beast-guardian-of-the-realms|title=Altered Beast: Guardian of the Realms|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=December 12, 2002|website=[[IGN]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011155642/http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/12/12/altered-beast-guardian-of-the-realms|archive-date=October 11, 2016|access-date=February 13, 2020}}</ref> While the graphics are improved compared to the original game, the scrolling mechanic remains the same.<ref name=":1" /> A [[PlayStation 2]] title known as ''Jūōki: Project Altered Beast'' in Japan and ''[[Altered Beast (2005 video game)|Altered Beast]]'' in Europe was released by Sega in 2005.<ref name=":1" /> It was planned for a North American release as well, but was later cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/FEA10CE2-5C27-46BD-858C-082B344D7285.htm|title=Sega's Altered Beast Cancelled For The US|last=Cook|first=Chris|date=2004-11-01|work=GameInformer.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305034700/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/FEA10CE2-5C27-46BD-858C-082B344D7285.htm|archive-date=March 5, 2006|access-date=2009-08-22}}</ref> Rather than serving as a sequel to the original game, the newer title features a more modern setting that is unconnected to the original game, with a darker and more violent tone. Uchida advised on the project, and stated, "We really couldn't steer away from the violence aspect. The American marketing side was cheering us on, so we did it as best we could." The 2005 ''Altered Beast'' received mixed reviews for its camera system and poor graphics.<ref name=":1" />

===Popular culture===
''Altered Beast'' has been referenced in other media. In 1993, [[Matthew Sweet]] named his album ''[[Altered Beast (album)|Altered Beast]]'' after the game. Sweet told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine that the title meant "whatever is inside you that someday might explode, and maybe you don't know it's there", which he found similar to the game, where "you have to find these little [[power-up]] things, and when you eat them you become the Altered Beast, this other creature that's really powerful and violent".<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Kelly|first=Christina|date=September 1995|title=King of Pop|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ra1GApGshtQC|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|page=73}}</ref> The character Neff, in his Rhino form as the boss of the game's final level, appeared in the 2012 [[Disney]] film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'', along with ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' villain [[Doctor Eggman]].<ref name=":1" /> The player character appears in his wolf form during [[Ulala (Space Channel 5)|Ulala]]'s attack in 2012's ''[[Project X Zone]]'' and 2015's ''[[Project X Zone 2]]'', along with several other SEGA characters.

King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard have a tale of the Altered Beast saga.
