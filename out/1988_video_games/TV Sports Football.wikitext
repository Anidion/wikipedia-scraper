'''''TV Sports: Football''''' is a 1988 video game by [[Cinemaware]] for [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[DOS]], and [[TurboGrafx-16]].

==Gameplay==
''TV Sports: Football'' is the first game released for a series of sports games which featured athletic action like on television.<ref name=cgw150/>

==Reception==
Wyatt Lee and J. D. Lambright reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and wrote that "action game fans who want a difficult game may not like this game as well as a strict arcade game like ''John Elway's Quarterback'', but players who want to capture the atmosphere, flow of play, and fast-moving competition of professional football should love it".<ref name="CGW56">{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Wyatt |last2=Lambright |first2=J. D. |title=Red Dogs and Hot Dogs: Cinemaware Captures The Gridiron |date=February 1989 |volume=1 |issue=56 |pages=30, 49}}</ref>

In the November 1989 edition of the British magazine ''[[Games International]]'' (issue 10), Ernesto Williams was not familiar with the American sport of football, but was able to learn the game through this videogame. Although he liked most of the game, including the graphics and audio, he did not admire the appearance of sports announcers from time to time, and pointed out that "mercifully this window dressing can be skipped in most cases, speeding up play considerably". He also noted that the incessant disk swapping slowed the game considerably. He concluded by giving both the game and its graphics above-average ratings of 4 out of 5, saying: "Simple but subtle, ''American Football'' is a game that needs time to fully appreciate".<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine|last=Williams|first=Ernesto| date=November 1989 |title=TV Sports: Football|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=10|pages=46}}</ref>

Matt Taylor reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and said that "despite the scattered flags on the play, as a multi-player game the call on ''TV Sports Football'' with this official is: 'The kick is up... It's long enough... It's good!'"<ref name="CGW79">{{cite magazine |last=Taylor |first=Matt |title=Live! From NEC -- It's...
