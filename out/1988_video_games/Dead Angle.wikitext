'''''Dead Angle''''', also known  as '''''Lead Angle''''' and '''''Gang Hunter''''', is a 1988 [[arcade video game|arcade]] [[shooter game]] developed by [[Seibu Kaihatsu]]. It is the follow-up to the company's mobster-themed ''[[Empire City: 1931]]''.<ref name=SU /> In ''Dead Angle'', players take control of the game's protagonist, who must rescue his girlfriend from a mob boss. A [[porting|port]] of the game was released by [[Sega]] for the [[Master System]] console.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Dead angle arcade screenshot.png|left|thumb|The player character is represented by a silhouette, which turns red when in the line of enemy fire and is filled with bullet holes as it is shot.]]

Like ''Empire City: 1931'' before it, players use a [[joystick]] to move a [[crosshair]] along the screen and shoot enemies. ''Dead Angle'' adds an on-screen representation of the [[player character]] in the form of a [[silhouette]], with an over-the-shoulder view similar to 1980s arcade [[List of boxing video games|boxing games]] (such as ''[[Punch-Out!! (arcade game)|Punch-Out]]'' and ''[[Heavyweight Champ]]'').<ref name=ACE>"[http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/1/100/dead_angle_review.html Dead Angle review]", July 1988. Advanced Computer Entertainment. p. 27.</ref> Multiple enemies now run in front of the player - the silhouette turns red when in the line of fire and is filled with bullet holes as it is shot. Just as in ''Empire City'', players can defend against shots, this time by pressing the duck button, which renders the player invulnerable for a very short period of time. Players start the game out with a standard pistol, but can pick up a [[tommy gun]] or a shotgun and use [[grenade]]s as well. Many of the objects in the background can be damaged or destroyed.<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |author=Seamus St. John |title=Dead Angle |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=15 May 1988 |issue=80 (June 1988) |url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/93/100/dead_angle_review.html}}</ref>

Players advance through the various time limited levels, from Italy to [[New York City]], [[Kansas]], then [[Chicago]], by eliminating a set amount of mobsters. The player must then fight the [[boss (video games)|boss]] of that level. The final boss must be defeated with one precise shot while he uses his hostage as a human shield.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Dead Angle'' on their August 15, 1988 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=338|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 August 1988|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>

Seamus St. John complimented ''Dead Angle'''s graphics and animation in ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' and compared the game favourably to its contemporary ''[[Operation Wolf]]'' (1987).<ref name=CVG /> A capsule review in ''[[Advanced Computer Entertainment]]'' highlighted the game's fast-paced gameplay and said: "If you want your reactions severely tested, check this one out".<ref name=ACE /> Another largely positive review appeared in ''[[Your Sinclair]]'', with the largest complaint with the game being the [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]].<ref name=YS>"[http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/58/100/dead_angle_review.html Dead Angle]". Your Sinclair. July 1988. p. 74.</ref> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' rated the game an 8 out of 10, calling it an "atmospheric 'shoot the target' game with enough variation to keep you coming back for more".<ref name=SU>"[http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/106/100/dead_angle_review.html Dead Angle]", Sinclair User. July 1988.</ref>

==Port==
Sega published a single-player port for the [[Master System]] in 1989. The game's instruction manual and box give names to the main characters. The player character is [[private investigator]] George Phoenix, his girlfriend is Jane and the mob leader is named Robert King. The port omits several levels, including the entire Kansas stage. The shotgun and grenades are not available and background objects can no longer be damaged.<ref name=manual>{{cite manual|title=Dead Angle Master System manual|publisher=Sega|date=1989}}</ref> Graphics are less detailed, with fewer frames of animation and most of the voice clips and in-game cinematics are not included.

===Reception===
The port was faulted for jerky scrolling in the January 1990 issue of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''. Reviewer Paul Rand said that the slow movement hampered the otherwise fun gameplay and gave the game a 68%.<ref name=CVG2>Rand, Paul. [http://www.smspower.org/Scans/CVG-Magazine-Issue098?gallerypage=117 Dead Angle Master System review]", January 1990. Computer and Video Games. p. 116.</ref> Despite this, ''Computer and Video Games'' subsequently published more positive reviews in their ''Complete Guide to Sega'' and ''Complete Guide to Consoles'', rating it 83% and calling it an "''Operation Wolf''-style coin-op" conversion. They lauded the graphics and gameplay, calling it "easily one of the best shooting games on the Sega".<ref name=CVG3>[http://www.smspower.org/Scans/CVGCompleteGuideToSega-Magazine-Issue1?gallerypage=55 Dead Angle].
