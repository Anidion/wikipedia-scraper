'''''James Bond: Live And Let Die''''' is a [[video game]] loosely based on the 1973 [[James Bond]] film ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''. The game was released by [[Domark]] for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1988.

''Live and Let Die'' is a [[racing video game|racing game]] in which the player navigates James Bond driving a modified [[speedboat]]. It did not start as a Bond game, being a rebranding after Domark saw [[Elite Systems]] working on a game named ''Aquablast'', and  thought the boat driving and fighting of said title resembled the speedboat chase of ''Live and Let Die''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lindner|first=Christoph |title=The James Bond Phenomenon: a Critical Reader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbIrAQAAIAAJ|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=2009|edition=2|isbn=978-0-7190-8095-1|page=317}}</ref>
