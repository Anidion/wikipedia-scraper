{{nihongo foot|'''''Parodius: The Octopus Saves the Earth'''''|パロディウス ～タコは地球を救う～|Parodiusu: Tako wa Chikyū o Sukū|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, also known as '''''Parodius''''', is a [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Konami]] for the [[MSX]] computer and was released in Japan. The game is notable for being the first title in the ''[[Parodius]]'' series, although it is often confused with its sequel ''[[Parodius! From Myth to Laughter]]''. The name itself is a [[portmanteau]] of "Gradius" and "Parody" and, eponymously, the game is a [[parody]] of the [[Gradius|''Gradius'' series]] of space-based horizontally scrolling shooters. Many of the characters and enemies are derived from that famous shooter series, while other elements are extracted from other Konami titles, such as ''[[Antarctic Adventure]]'' and ''[[TwinBee]]''. This game is of particular note in the series as being heavily infused with Japanese culture and folklore.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is very similar to the ''Gradius'' games, with other aspects from games such as ''[[TwinBee]]''. However, the characters are replaced with silly characters taken from either these or other Konami games, as well as [[Japanese culture]]. The music is mostly taken from [[European classical music|classical music]] pieces.

The player can play as either Tako, an octopus, the Penguin (father of [[Pentarou]]) from ''[[Antarctic Adventure]]'' and the exclusive MSX game ''[[Penguin Adventure]]'', Goemon from the ''[[Ganbare Goemon]]'' series, the Popolon knight from the MSX game ''[[Knightmare (1986 video game)|Knightmare]]'' or the [[Vic Viper]] spaceship from ''Gradius''. The game is composed of six stages consisting of various obstacles and enemies such as penguins and bees, as well as more traditional ''Gradius'' enemies such as [[moai]]. As with ''Gradius'', the game utilizes a similar selection-bar based power-up system.

==Reception==
''Parodius'' was awarded Best Game that Never Came out in the U.S. in 1992 by [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]].<ref name="egmbuyersguide1993">{{cite magazine |year=1993 |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |issue={{volume needed|date=December 2020}} }}</ref>

==Ports==
''Parodius'' was later included in ''[[Konami Antiques MSX Collection|Konami Antiques MSX Collection Vol.3]]'' for [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], ''Konami Antiques MSX Collection Ultra Pack'' for [[Sega Saturn]] and ''[[Parodius Portable]]'' for [[PlayStation Portable]] with enhanced graphics.

In addition, it was released for [[Mobile Phones|mobile phones]] in December 2006 and for Wii [[Virtual Console]] on January 12, 2010, and Wii U on December 25, 2013, in Japan. Also, the MSX version was re-released for Windows PC on Online Store Project EGG on April 11, 2014, in Japan.

== Legacy ==
In 2021, Konami announced a contest encouraging indie developers to make games based on some of its classic series, including ''Parodius: The Octopus Saves the Earth''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shigeta|first=Ryuichi|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-indie-games-classic-series-gradius-twinbee-goemon|title=Konami is Inviting Indie Developers to Make New Games Based on Some of Its Classic Series — Famous IP from the past may be revived through indie creators' eyes|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 2021|access-date=2022-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211220054434/https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-indie-games-classic-series-gradius-twinbee-goemon|archive-date=2021-12-20|url-status=live}}</ref>
