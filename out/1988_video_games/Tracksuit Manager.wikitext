The player controls an international [[association football|football]] team who has failed to perform adequately in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] and must qualify for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] through the 1988 European Championships.<ref name="mobygames"/> Instead of a [[transfer market]], the player is given a choice between 100 eligible football players and must choose from 22 of them.<ref name="mobygames"/> The matches are presented in the [[Sports commentator|running commentary]] style of sports announcing with a small graphic depicting where the [[football (association football)|ball]] is.<ref name="mobygames"/> Players must qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988 UEFA European Football Championships]] in [[West Germany]].

All the famous football players like [[Peter Shilton]] and [[Diego Maradona]] are included in this game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/tracksuitmanager.htm| title = Player information | publisher = YRNSRY.com | date = | accessdate = 2011-03-28}}</ref> There is an England player called 'Breacher' in the game. In reality there was no recognised top flight footballer with this name. Many commentators assume that this error was due to a typo of the name of then [[Luton Town]] player [[Tim Breacker]].
