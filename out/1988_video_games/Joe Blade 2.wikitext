'''''Joe Blade 2''''' is the second game in the ''Joe Blade'' series.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:ZX_joeblade2.png|thumb|left|Joe encounters a trenchcoated citizen and a punk (ZX Spectrum)]]
''Joe Blade 2'' took a rather different approach to the first game. Instead of being a soldier, Blade was this time a vigilante taking to the city to rid the streets of criminals, rescuing old-age pensioners along the way. Blade was no longer armed with a gun, and had to jump over villains, just touching them with his feet, to dispatch them. In order for the civilians to be successfully rescued, the protagonist was given a simple puzzle (called a sub-game level) of organizing the pattern of symbols. There were four types of these sub-games and all of them needed to be completed within 60 seconds. This almost surreal take on the game was in stark contrast to the comparatively more gritty realism of the first installment. The game was also known for being considerably easier than the first title, almost to the point where many players managed to complete the game in one hour-long sitting.

The Spectrum version of the game included a version of ''[[Invade-a-Load]]'' featuring [[Pac-Man]].<ref>[https://www.jotdown.es/2020/01/cargando/ Cargando… Publicado por Diego Cuevas] (in Spanish), Jotdown.es</ref>

Paul Rixon for ''[[Page 6]]'' said: "I did find the original Joe Blade more instantly playable, but this is probably due to the lack of instructions supplied with my preview copy of the sequel [...] I'd advise all arcade adventuring types, especially fans of the original game, to grab a copy without hesitation!"<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Rixon|first=Paul|date=June 1990|title=Here Comes Joe Again|url=https://archive.org/details/Page6-44-Jun90/page/44/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Page 6]]|issue=44|page=44|access-date=1 March 2021}}</ref>

''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' said: "short term ''Joe Blade II'' is playable, which wins much of my vote."<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=October 1988|title=Joe Blade II: Hit baddies very hard and not feel guilty|url=https://archive.org/details/Crash_Magazine_057/page/30/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|issue=57|page=30|access-date=1 March 2021}}</ref>

Reviewing the [[Atari ST]] version, ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said: "If you enjoyed the Joe Blade and you are looking for more of the same, get your hands on this toute-de-suite."<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=January 1990|title=Joe Blade II|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_0098/page/84/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=98|page=80|access-date=1 March 2021}}</ref>

Richard Henderson for ''Computer Games Week'' said: "Admittedly the graphics are good, but there is no real variety between screens and the sprites move far too slowly to make it fun."<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=28 September 1988|title=Joe Blade II|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Games_Week_Issue_06/page/31/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=Computer Gamesweek|volume=1|issue=6|page=32|access-date=1 March 2021}}</ref>

''[[Sinclair User]]'' said: "''Joe Blade II'' is a bit like watching a ballet: it's all very pretty and artistic, but you soon end up wishing someone would cut loose with a machine-gun."<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=November 1988|title=Joe Blade II|url=https://archive.org/details/Sinclair_User_080/page/76/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Sinclair User]]|issue=80|page=64|access-date=1 March 2021}}</ref>
