'''''Target: Renegade''''' is a [[beat'em up]] video game released on the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] systems in the late 1980s by [[Ocean Software]] on their "[[Imagine Software|Imagine]]" label, as well as a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version published by [[Taito]]. The game is a sequel to ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]'' and was followed by ''[[Renegade III: The Final Chapter]]''. When acquiring the license to convert the original arcade game ''Renegade'' to home computers, Ocean acquired the option to produce and release their own home-computer-only sequels to the game, and ''Target Renegade'' was the first of these sequels.

On most formats, the game caters for one or two players and concerns itself with the adventures of a streetfighter (or a pair of identical streetfighters) known only as "Renegade", who seek(s) revenge against a local crime kingpin named "Mr. Big" for murdering his or their brother Matt. Other versions have said Matt was not murdered, but instead held hostage by Mr. Big and the player needs to free him. The player character varies, depending on the format, but is usually represented as topless apart from a [[leather]] vest and wearing [[jeans]]. Early stages show the player outdoors and after defeating a boss character, reaching a [[pay phone]] to report on his progress.

Regardless of the format, the cover of the game and the title screen (as seen on the adjacent image) portrays a topless street fighter performing a flying kick through a window. In keeping with video game [[Computer and video game packaging|box art]] and advertising of the era, the character shown in this illustration bears little relation to any character in the game itself. The actual picture is based on famous martial artist [[Joe Lewis (martial artist)|Joe Lewis]] from the cover of his book ''The World's Greatest Fighter Teaches You How To Master Bruce Lee's Fighting System'', but has been adjusted so as to fit in with the character of Renegade.

The game comprises five levels, though details of enemies and weapons vary from one version to another (the NES version in particular is more like ''[[Double Dragon]]'' than the home computer versions). The NES and C64 versions of the game do not have a two-player co-operative mode.

==Legacy==
[[Ocean Software]] produced a second ''Renegade'' sequel titled ''[[Renegade III: The Final Chapter]]''. [[Technos Japan Corp.]], the developers of the original arcade version of ''Renegade'', produced their own line of sequels and spin-offs to ''Nekketsu K≈çha Kunio-kun'', the Japanese version of ''Renegade'', for the Japanese market. ''Target: Renegade'' and ''Renegade 3'' are not related in any way to the ''[[Kunio-kun (series)|Kunio-kun]]'' series.

In 2006 an unofficial [[Video game remake|remake]] of the Spectrum version<ref>[http://www.ys3.org/?page.id=2  Target; 2006]</ref> was released for Windows. Expanding the multiplayer element to allow six simultaneous players, ''Target: 2006'' received a 70% score in issue 41 of [[Retro Gamer]].
