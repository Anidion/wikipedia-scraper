==Gameplay==
Players fight against hundreds of robot warriors equipped with particle beam weapons. The game is played from the bird's eye view. The player's mission is to blast through nine levels of various 3D terrain, shooting aliens and ships on three different planes.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

One of the buttons is used to cycle through the three planes. Along the way, there are several bosses that the player has to defeat. The later ones drop a power-up, which the player can use to upgrade the ship. Some of the [[power-up]]s include double shots and laser beams. Another power-up gives players an extra ship on their side. The first one joins the fight, later ones go into reserve. ''Blade Eagle'' is designed for play in conjunction with the Sega 3-D Glasses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588040-blade-eagle-3-d |title=Blade Eagle 3-D - Game Description & Infos |publisher=[[GameFAQs]] |accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref>
