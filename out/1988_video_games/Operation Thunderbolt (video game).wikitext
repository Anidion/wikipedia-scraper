'''''Operation Thunderbolt''''' is a [[light gun shooter]] video game developed by [[Taito]] and released for [[Arcade game|arcades]] in 1988. As the sequel to ''[[Operation Wolf]]'', changes include two-player gameplay with two [[positional gun]] controllers mounted on the [[arcade cabinet]], and a new forward-scrolling [[pseudo-3D]] perspective combined with [[side-scrolling]] sections.

The arcade game was a commercial success and was one of the top three highest-grossing dedicated [[1989 in video games|arcade games of 1989]] in both Japan and the United States. Versions were released for [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The arcade exclusive sequel ''[[Operation Wolf 3]]'' was released in 1994.

==Gameplay==
Green berets Roy Adams and Hardy Jones must save American hostages from a hijacked airliner which was forced to land in the fictional African province, Kalubya. They must capture six different bases, shoot enemies with machine guns or grenade launcher, and try to save the hostages. Enemies include soldiers, jeeps, tanks, and helicopters, attacking with bullets, grenades, or rockets. 

In stages 4 and 6, killing one of the hostages will decrease the player's life. At least one hostage must be rescued in those stages, or the game is over. In Stage 8, the players must engage with the lead hijacker holding the pilot hostage. Continues are not permitted. If the pilot gets killed, a bad ending will be shown "The pilot is dead; escape is impossible". If the hijacker is killed, the good ending will be shown where the player and hostages flee the hostile nation, with the plane's takeoff.

Changes from ''Operation Wolf'' include the [[arcade cabinet]] using [[positional gun]] controllers instead of [[light gun]],<ref name=retrogamer153>{{cite magazine|title =Ultimate Guide: Operation Thunderbolt|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=153|pages=36|author=Martyn Carroll|quote="Rather than using lightguns the sequel utilised a pair of positional guns that directly controlled invisible cursors on the screen"}}</ref> two-player simultaneous play with two mounted guns, and a new forward-scrolling [[pseudo-3D]] perspective combined with [[side-scrolling]] sections.<ref name="CU65"/>

The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] version was released by Taito in 1994<ref name=retrogamer139 /> and works with the [[SNES Mouse]]<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Let's Get Technical|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=76|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=14}}</ref> and the [[Super Scope]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Buyers Beware|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=98 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=November 1996|page=24}}</ref> The player can choose from a variety of different characters.<ref name=retrogamer139 /> The storyline was altered so that the hijackers were members of the fictional Bintazi People's Republic, under lifelong dictator General Abul Bazarre, who demands that his comrades be freed or the hostages will be executed.

==Influence==
The story for the game is loosely based on the plot of the [[Operation_Thunderbolt_(film)|film by the same name]], which in turn was based on the real-life [[Entebbe raid]] that occurred on July 4th, 1976.
