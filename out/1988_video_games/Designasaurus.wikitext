It is divided into three activities: "Walk-a-Dinosaur", "Build-a-Dinosaur" and "Print-a-Dinosaur".<ref name="DSaurus-Amiga"/>

==Development==
In 1987, Ezra Sidran signed a contract with Britannica Software for the development of an educational dinosaur game. Shortly before signing the contract, Sidran graduated from [[Marycrest College Historic District|Marycrest College]] and received a computer animation degree. Sidran insisted that ''Designasaurus'' not be looked at as a game due to it being educational and accurate. Many of Sidran's friends in the same computer animation program helped him complete the game's artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dinosaur-island.com/category/designasaurus/ |title=Designasaurus. |last=Sidran |first=Ezra |date=April 13, 2013 |website=Dinosaur Island  |access-date=January 23, 2022}}</ref> One of the game's developers was Edward Isenberg. Isenberg said of the game in 2012, "This was a low resolution, two dimensional game because it was in the early 90s. You'd be able to walk the dinosaur from one side of the screen to the other and see if you could avoid being eaten."<ref name="TV">{{cite web |url=https://www.wqad.com/article/news/local/drone/8-in-the-air/qc-men-making-dinosaur-video-game/526-47305aa6-9375-48d1-9561-f8f53d70d88c |title=QC men making dinosaur video game |last=Noe |first=Megan |date=November 25, 2012 |website=[[WQAD-TV]] |access-date=January 23, 2022}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The game consists of three parts which is the game itself, creating a dinosaur, and printing coloring pages of dinosaurs.<ref name="Courant">{{cite news |last=Carrington |first=Kathryn |date=June 21, 1988 |title=Hartford Courant |page=51 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/93234914/hartford-courant/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> To create a dinosaur, a [[paleontologist]] of the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]] allows the player to use bones from its collection to build their own dinosaur. Every design details the likelihood of the final dinosaur surviving.<ref>{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Howard J. |date=January 4, 1992 |title=Software can be both fun and educational |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/93235120/the-daily-times/ |work=The Daily Times |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> The game part of the software lets the player control their created dinosaur to help it survive while navigating its environment. The software includes a Dinosaur Hall of Fame certificate after the successful completion of the game and 12 dinosaur pictures which can be printed on t-shirts.<ref name="Gutman">{{cite news |authorlink=Dan Gutman |last=Gutman |first=Dan |date=February 3, 1989 |title=Leaping lizards!

==Reception==
The Software Publishers Association named ''Designasaurus'' as the "best education software of 1987".<ref name="Courant"/> In the 1988 CODiE Awards, the game won "Best Educational Program" and "Best Pre-school or Primary School Program."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siia.net/codie/About-the-Awards/Past-Winners/1988-Winners|title=SIIA Codie Awards Past Winners – 1988|access-date=2018-05-01|archive-date=2019-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419201219/http://www.siia.net/codie/About-the-Awards/Past-Winners/1988-Winners|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was reported on November 27, 1989, that ''Designasaurus'' and ''[[The Universal Military Simulator|UMS I]]'' together gained $5 {{1/2}} million for the publisher Intergalactic over an 18-month period.<ref name="Dispatch">{{cite news |date=November 27, 1989 |title=War |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/93235564/the-dispatch/ |work=[[The Dispatch]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> According to the creator Sidran, the [[Royalty payment|royalties]] were split between the employees via a "gross-sharing" plan.<ref name="Dispatch"/>

Kathryn Carrington of ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' said that the game was "disappointing" and that she "expected more" due to the game winning an award from the Software Publishers Association.<ref name="Courant"/>  ''[[PC Gamer]]'' reviewer Richard Cobbett wrote, "Unlike many edutainment games, Designasaurus does at least offer a solid amount of 'tainment' with its 'edu', and it's fun to mess around with. It has a few nice features, like being able to print out your dinosaurs, and the added hilarity of later levels developing into almost bullet-hell levels of crap to wade through."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.siia.net/codie/About-the-Awards/Past-Winners/1988-Winners |title=Crapshoot: The edutainment game about designing your own dinosaurs |last=Cobbett |first=Richard |date=April 9, 2021 |website=[[PC Gamer]] |access-date=January 23, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731042044/https://www.siia.net/codie/About-the-Awards/Past-Winners/1988-Winners |archive-date=31 July 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Later releases==
A sequel, ''Designasaurus II'', was released in 1990 for MS-DOS. Aided by two paleontologists, Britannica Software was able to accurately include dinosaurs in the correct time periods they once existed.<ref name="DSaurus-Compute136">{{cite magazine|title=Designasaurus version II |url=https://archive.org/stream/1991-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_136_1991_Dec#page/n173 |magazine=[[Compute!]] |issue=136 |publisher=[[ABC Publishing]] |date=December 1991 |pages=133–134}}</ref>  Sidran and Isenberg started a funding campaign for an updated version of the game on [[Kickstarter]] in 2012.<ref name="TV"/>
