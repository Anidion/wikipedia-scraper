[[File:Centerfold_Squares_Amiga_Gameplay_Screenshot.png|thumb|The game is played on a 10×10 grid.<ref name=ahoy /><ref name=info /> Red squares cause the player to lose points, and green squares award points.<ref name=info />]]

''Centerfold Squares'' is a variation of [[reversi]] referred to as 'Double-Up' that is played on a ten by ten grid; four counters of two opposing colors are placed in the center in a two by two alternating pattern.<ref name=ahoy /><ref name=info /> The game is played against an AI of varying difficulty, and each player takes turns placing counters on the board next to an existing counter, and if a player surrounds an opposing counter with two counters of their own color, that counter then becomes their color.<ref name=ahoy /> ''Centerfold Squares'' has special squares in the grid, which activate different effects when a counter is placed on them: red squares subtract points, green squares give extra points, and yellow squares allow the player to take another turn.<ref name=info /> There is also a '???' button which takes up a player's turn in exchange for a random effect,<ref name=info /> such as large point changes or instant wins or losses.<ref name=ahoy /> Points are earned through the player changing opposing counters to their color, and earning a set number of points (determined at the beginning of the round) will win the game.<ref name=ahoy /> The points are then used to remove one of the black tiles covering a [[Digitization|digitized]] image of a nude model - each tile has a set number of points required to remove it.<ref name=ahoy /><ref name=info /><ref name=STlog /><ref name=antic>{{cite magazine|title = ST New Products: Artworx Trio|date = December 1988|url = https://archive.org/details/1988-12-anticmagazine/page/n57/mode/2up|magazine = Antic|publisher = Antic Publishing|last = Pearlman|first = Gregg|volume = 7|issue = 8|page = 57}}</ref> If the AI wins, an already revealed tile is covered up.<ref name=ahoy />

''Centerfold Squares'' has twelve female model photos in the base game.<ref name=info /><ref name=generation /> An expansion disk with eleven additional model photos was released.<ref name=cybersex /> Each photo is marked with the difficulty of the AI, and the difficulty is tied to the unlockable photo as opposed to being selected by the player. The available difficulty levels are Below Average, Average, and Above Average.<ref name=ahoy />

''Centerfold Squares' '' digitized nude graphics were originally digitized in [[Black and white#Photography|black and white]], specifically 16 levels of grey, and subsequently colored digitally in a process referred to as 'Digitized Plus'. Doug McFarland, ''Centerfold Squares' '' designer, stated that camera filters were used "to achieve better contrast", and in addendum to the images being colored digitally, "all edges are retouched to [[Anti-aliasing|eliminate any aliasing]] effects. The results are more vibrant colors, superior to conventional color digitizing."<ref name=commodoremag>{{cite magazine|title = Coming Attractions: Artworx|date = April 1988|url = https://archive.org/details/16-commodore-magazine/page/n49/mode/2up|magazine = Commodore Magazine|publisher = Commodore Business Machines|issue = 16|page = 48}}</ref> ''Centerfold Squares'' was originally planned to have ten female and two male models,<ref name=ahoy /><ref name=commodoremag /> but this was cancelled before release in lieu of twelve female models.<ref name=info /> All ports of ''Centerfold Squares'' cost US$29.95 in 1988,<ref name=ahoy /><ref name=STlog>{{cite magazine|title = Two new programs from Artworx|date = May 1989|url = https://archive.org/details/ST_Log_Magazine_Issue_31/page/n9/mode/2up |magazine = ST Log|publisher = Larry Flynt Publishing|issue = 31|page = 11}}</ref><ref name=cybersex>{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=Phillip |last2=Tamosaitis |first2=Nancy |last3=Spear |first3=Peter |last4=Soper |first4=Virginia |title=The Joy Of Cybersex: The Underground Guide to Electronic Erotica |date=1993 |publisher=Brady Publishing |isbn=1-56686-107-1 |page=332 |url=https://archive.org/details/The.Joy.Of.Cybersex.1993/page/n363/mode/2up}}</ref><ref name=amazing>{{cite magazine|title = Amiga Product Guide Games Edition: Centerfold Squares|date = August 1988|url = https://archive.org/details/amazing-computing-magazine-1988-08/page/n51/mode/2up|magazine = Amazing Computing|publisher = PiM Publications|volume = 3|issue = 8|page = 51}}</ref> and 'around 65-70' [[Deutsche Mark|Deutschmark]].<ref name=powerplay /><ref name=asm>{{cite magazine|title = Reversi-Strip|date = December 1989|url = https://retrocdn.net/images/e/e0/ASM_DE_1989-12.pdf|magazine = Aktueller Software Markt|publisher = Tronic Verlag|first = Manfred|last = Kleimann|page = 83|language = German}}</ref> The DOS version of ''Centerfold Squares'' cost 2250 [[Spanish peseta]] in 1990.<ref name=ocio />
