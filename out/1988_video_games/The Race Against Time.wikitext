'''''The Race Against Time''''' is a 1988 [[Adventure video game|adventure]] video game designed by the [[Oliver Twins]], and developed and published by [[Codemasters]]. The player controls [[Sudan]]ese runner [[Omar Khalifa]], who has to venture to six continents to light torch bowls and raise flags to begin the 1988 [[Sport Aid]], a sport-themed charity organization. A tie-in to the Sport Aid charity, all proceeds were donated to the campaign. The game was released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] platforms.

''The Race Against Time'' received a polarized reception from video game critics. The game had been expected to raise [[£]]1 million, but instead became a commercial failure, and Codemasters later expressed regret for their association with Sport Aid. After its release, the game had to be recalled because of Codemasters' unauthorized usage of an image of [[Jesse Owens]] on the packaging; it was replaced with a picture of [[Carl Lewis]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Race Against Time gameplay.png|thumb|left|Opening screen]]

In ''The Race Against Time'', the player controls [[Sudan]]ese runner [[Omar Khalifa]], who was the torch runner for the 1986 [[Sport Aid]] campaign. The goal of the game is to raise a flag and light a torch bowl in six continents over five in-game hours, beginning in [[Sudan]]. In side-scrolling game screens, the player runs past landmarks such as [[Buckingham Palace]], the [[Sydney Opera House]] and [[Mount Rushmore]]. The player travels between screens by using airplanes or transporter arrows.<ref name=CRASH/>

Each continent contains unique environmental hazards to avoid, such as falling bricks and collapsing bridges. Water and rain are also hazards as they can extinguish the torch and end the game. Letting the time run out would also cause the game to end, requiring [[hourglasses]] to be collected to increase the amount of time left. Obstacles blocking the journey can be resolved using items picked up, including a [[spanner]] and [[sandbag]]. Lighting all the flames and raising the flags opens up the final destination to the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]], beginning the 1988 Sport Aid.<ref name=CRASH/>

==Development==
''The Race Against Time'' was designed by the [[Oliver Twins]], Andrew and Philip Oliver, and was developed and published by [[Codemasters]]. Codemasters contacted the Sport Aid charity, volunteering the twins to be the designers. They wrote the game using the same [[game engine]] for their [[Dizzy (series)|''Dizzy'' series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olivertwins.com/history/page/11|title=Our History|author=The Oliver Twins|author-link=The Oliver Twins|page=11|access-date=26 April 2020|archive-date=26 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126155001/http://www.olivertwins.com/history/page/11|url-status=live}}</ref> Gameplay was first shown on the television programme ''[[Get Fresh]]'', on 7 May 1988.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer And Video Games]]|title=News|date=May 1998|issue=79|page=9|url=https://archive.org/details/ComputerAndVideoGamesIssue079May88/page/n7/mode/2up}}</ref> [[Peter Gabriel]]'s 1980 [[Single (music)|single]] "[[Games Without Frontiers (song)|Games Without Frontiers]]" was included in the game's soundtrack.<ref name=AAction/> The game was released in April 1988 for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olivertwins.com/TheRaceAgainstTime|title=The Race Against Time|author=The Oliver Twins|author-link=The Oliver Twins|access-date=April 26, 2020|archive-date=November 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110034257/http://www.olivertwins.com/TheRaceAgainstTime|url-status=live}}</ref>

The original packaging of ''The Race Against Time'' had an image of American athlete [[Jesse Owens]] on its front cover. However, after the game had been released, Owens’ estate objected. Codemasters had neglected to obtain permission from the family to use Owens' likeness, and they declined to grant permission retroactively. Therefore, Codemasters was forced to recall all of the copies of the game that had already been produced, and to change promotional materials. The company replaced the image of Owens with one of [[Carl Lewis]], who had offered the use of his likeness for free.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Commodore User]]|title=Race Image Change|date=August 1988|issue=59|page=7|url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-user-magazine-59/page/n5/mode/2up/}}</ref> [[ACE (magazine)|''ACE'']] magazine would later call the game's botched release one of the biggest marketing disasters of 1988.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]|title=The Ace Fido Awards|date=December 1988|issue=15|page=121|url=https://archive.org/details/ACEIssue15Dec88/page/n119/mode/2up/}}</ref>

Upon its release, ''The Race Against Time'' received a polarized reception by video game critics reviewing the versions on all three platforms. Paul Boughton recommended the game in ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', calling it a "decent arcade adventure for a decent price".<ref name=CVG/> Rachael MacDonald from ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' was also positive, calling it a "more than competent arcade adventure", as well as noting that the proceeds would go to charity.<ref name=YSin/> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' reviewed the gameplay and animation negatively, criticizing the running animation as "unconvincing" and calling the background art "dreadful".<ref name=SU/> ''[[Zzap!64]]'' reviewed the Commodore 64 version, describing it as "abysmal" and criticizing the controls for being too awkward.<ref name=Zaap/> ''[[Commodore User]]'' gave the Commodore version an overall rating of 5/10, calling the game "nothing special".<ref name=CUreview>{{cite magazine|title = Screen Scene: Race Against Time|date =October 1988 |url =https://archive.org/details/commodore-user-magazine-61/page/n71/mode/2up |magazine = Commodore User|publisher =EMAP |last =Pattenden |first =Mike |issue =61 |page =73 }}</ref>

The game was a commercial flop. Sport Aid had predicted it would raise [[£]]1 million for the charity.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[New Computer Express]]|title=Two Years Ago|date=February 1990|issue=65|page=8|url=https://archive.org/details/NH2021_New_Computer_Express_Issue065.pdf/page/n7/mode/2up}}</ref> it instead sold 25,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Ingham|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/90012060/the-guardian/|title=Sugar and the sizzle|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|page=28|date=December 29, 1988|accessdate=December 5, 2021|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|archive-date=December 4, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211204133416/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/90012060/the-guardian/|url-status=live}}</ref> In December 1988, Codemasters expressed regret for having been associated with Sport Aid.
