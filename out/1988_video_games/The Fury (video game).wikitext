''The Fury'' is a [[Racing game|racing]] game set in the year 2045[[AD]] on the artificial planet Devs. Racing on a gutter shaped track orbiting the planet, racers race for money. The races are broadcast by The Network, a television station that also sponsor the races and train the racers. During these races, some of the drivers disappear while racing at top speed. One driver, after reappearing, explained it by saying "It's The Fury..."<ref name="YS1">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Sinclair]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|title=YS Mega Preview|last=Nash|first=Tommy|page=53|issue=31|date=July 1988|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-31/YourSinclair_31_Jul_1988#page/n51/mode/2up}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The player must qualify in each race through different objectives. Qualifications of races range from speed trials, to killing a certain amount of "Nids", or young unqualified racers. Another type of race is the Tag Races, a race version of [[Tag (game)|tag]].<ref name="YS1"/> Completing these tasks rewards the player money, where they can spend on new vehicles, car repairs, [[missiles]] and [[flamethrowers]], fuel, and [[escape pods]] that can eject the player from their car to avoid danger.<ref name="YS1"/><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|title=Preview|page=110|date=June 1988|issue=53|url=https://archive.org/stream/Crash_No._53_1988-06_Newsfield_GB#page/n109/mode/2up}}</ref>
