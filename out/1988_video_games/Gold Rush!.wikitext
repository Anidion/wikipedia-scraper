'''''Gold Rush!''''' (later retitled '''''California: Gold Rush!''''')<ref name="softwarefarm">{{cite web|url=http://www.softwarefarm.com/gr_home.htm|title=The Software Farm – California Gold Rush|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212084258/http://www.softwarefarm.com/gr_home.htm |archive-date=2011-12-12}}</ref> is a graphic [[adventure video game]] designed by Doug and Ken MacNeill and originally released by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]] in 1988.

''Gold Rush!'' is one of the last games that Sierra made with the [[Adventure Game Interpreter|AGI]] interface and is one of the most complicated. The rights to the game are currently owned and published by The Software Farm by its original developers the MacNeills.<ref name="softwarefarm" />

== Gameplay ==
The game is set in 1848, just before the [[California Gold Rush]]. The player is [[Brooklyn]] newspaperman Jerrod Wilson, who soon receives word that he must go to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] to meet his long-lost brother. After a few minutes of gameplay, word arrives that gold has been found in California, and it becomes much more difficult for Jerrod to settle his affairs in Brooklyn and find a way to Sacramento.

There are multiple paths which Jerrod can take to get to his brother. He can travel on a [[stagecoach]], which is the cheapest path, and the only path that is always available to Jerrod, no matter how long he spends in Brooklyn. This path brings Jerrod into contact with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], unruly oxen, parching deserts, and the likelihood of a winter storm in the [[Sierra Nevada]]. He can also travel by ship to [[Panama]], cross through treacherous swamps and jungles on foot, and then catch another ship to Sacramento. This route is more expensive than the others and also requires Jerrod to prepare carefully for many hazards of the tropical climate of Panama, from [[malaria]] to jungle ants to crocodiles. The third and most time-consuming path is to journey all the way around [[Cape Horn]] on a ship. This choice has its own perils, from storms to [[scurvy]]. On each route, Jerrod can perish at random by a disease for which there is not yet any cure, such as [[cholera]], making it prudent for players to save their game whenever possible and in multiple slots. Once Jerrod arrives in Sacramento, the three routes converge and all of the puzzles are the same. In California, Jerrod must try to [[prospecting|prospect for gold]], avoid bandits, and locate his mysterious brother.

== Copy protection ==
''Gold Rush!'' uses words from the book ''California Gold: Story of the Rush to Riches'' by Lou and Phyllis Zauner, which came with the game as a form of [[copy protection]]. If the player fails to enter the correct word at a certain point during the game, their character is immediately arrested for [[land claim|claim jumping]] and hanged on the gallows, which is the same as the regular in-game punishment for claim jumping, being caught in someone's hotel room, or stealing.
