'''''Rally Bike'''''{{efn|Also known as {{nihongo|'''''Dash Rascal'''''|ダッシュ野郎|''Dash Yarō''||lead=yes}} in Japan.}} is a [[Racing video game|racing]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] originally developed by [[Toaplan]] and published by [[Taito]] in May 1988.<ref name="G49">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/gamest0049#page/51/mode/2up|title=東亜プラン|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref> In ''Rally Bike'', players compete against computer-controlled opponents in races across locations in the [[United States]]. Initially released in arcades, the game was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[X68000]] by different developers.

''Rally Bike'' was met with mixed reception from [[video game magazines]] and dedicated outlets that reviewed the game when it launched in arcades and its ports. As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan [[Intellectual property|IP]]s.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Rally Bike (Dash Yarō).png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]
''Rally Bike'' is a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down]] [[motorcycle]] [[road racing]] game where players observe from above and races across six increasingly difficult stages, along with two [[bonus stage]]s, all taking place in the [[United States]], with the main objective of crossing the finish line and passing an established number of competitors.<ref name="RBDYss">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/dashyaro.html|title=ダッシュ野郎|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2019-10-29|language=ja}}</ref><ref name="RBDYNESmanual">''Rally Bike'' instruction booklet (Nintendo Entertainment System, US)</ref> Along the way, players must also dodge incoming obstacles scattered on the stages to avoid any accident, which causes a great reduction of fuel.<ref name="RBDYss"/><ref name="RBDYNESmanual"/>

Fuel is a major obstacle of the game as well, as players must refuel their bike by stopping at the [[filling station]], however this will also cause competitors to take advantage, as they never run out of fuel and running out of it results in a [[game over]] unless more credits are inserted into the arcade machine to [[Glossary of video game terms#Continue|continue]] playing.<ref name="RBDYss"/><ref name="RBDYNESmanual"/>

On occasions, a [[helicopter]] will come and drop an [[Item (gaming)|item]] to the road during races, ranging from [[turbo]] (which can be increased a second time by picking up the turbo item again) to helper bikers that guards the players from crashing against rival racers.<ref name="RBDYss"/><ref name="RBDYNESmanual"/> In the NES version, a shop mechanic where players can buy new parts to improve their vehicle is introduced after completing each race.<ref name="RBDYNESmanual"/> The title uses a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a single player will [[Spawning (gaming)|respawn]] at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before crashing.

''Rally Bike'' was released in arcades worldwide in May 1988 by Taito.<ref name="ATVGL:JaO1971-2005"/> The [[Soundtrack#Video game soundtracks|soundtrack]] was composed by Osamu Ōta under the alias "Ree".<ref name="PSGv10">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=東亜プランインタビュー|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=F.S.G Club|date=September 1989|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name="RBdyvgmdb">{{cite web|url=https://vgmdb.net/album/5540|title=H24X-10005 &#124; TATSUJIN ~TOA PLAN GAME MUSIC SCENE ONE~|work=vgmdb.net|publisher=VGMdb|access-date=2019-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508223350/https://vgmdb.net/album/5540|archive-date=8 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="vgmoRBdy">{{cite web|last=Kotowski|first=Don|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/truxton/|title=Truxton -Toaplan Game Music Scene-|website=vgmonline.net|publisher=Video Game Music Online|date=1 August 2012|access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref> In June 1989, an album containing music from ''Rally Bike'' and other Toaplan games was published exclusively in Japan by [[Datam Polystar]].<ref name="RBdyvgmdb"/><ref name="vgmoRBdy"/>

== Ports ==
On 15 June 1990, a Nintendo Entertainment System port of ''Rally Bike'' developed by [[Visco Corporation]] was first released in Japan and later in North America by [[Romstar]] on September of the same year.<ref name="GDRfc">{{cite web|url=http://tk-nz.game.coocan.jp/gamedatabase/software/DB_NTC1_FC1990.html|title=FAMICOM Soft > 1990|publisher=GAME Data Room|accessdate=2019-10-29|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827210607/http://tk-nz.game.coocan.jp/gamedatabase/software/DB_NTC1_FC1990.html|archive-date=27 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The NES version does not keep the same stages and backgrounds, likely due to hardware limitations. On 23 May 1991, the title later received a faithful [[Video game conversion|conversion]] to the Sharp X68000 by SPS and only published in Japan by [[Sharp Corporation]], although it contains several minor differences when compared to the original version such as the modified aspect ratio, missing animations, among other changes.<ref name="Oh!X110">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/OhX1990-1995/Oh%21X_1991-06#page/n29/mode/1up|title=The Softouch - Software Information: ダッシュ野郎|magazine=[[:ja:Oh!X|Oh!X]]|issue=110|publisher=[[SB Creative|SoftBank Creative]]|date=June 1991|page=28|lang=ja}}</ref><ref name="VGSx68k">{{cite web|last=Matsubara|first=Keigo|url=http://vgsearch.info/list/x68_all2.htm|title=X680x0ソフトリスト963タイトル|publisher=Video Game Search|date=2019|access-date=2019-10-29|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415093707/http://vgsearch.info/list/x68_all2.htm|archive-date=15 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] conversion was in development alongside ''[[Slap Fight MD]]'' by M.N.M Software, but was never released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://note.com/beep21/n/ncd94d6b47320|title=「スラップファイト3671」開発日誌 Beep21出張版 #0|work=Beep21|publisher=note|date=January 28, 2022|access-date=2022-01-29|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220129135650/https://note.com/beep21/n/ncd94d6b47320|archive-date=2022-01-29|url-status=live}}</ref>
