'''''Narc''''' (stylized as '''''NARC''''') is a 1988 [[run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] [[arcade game]] designed by [[Eugene Jarvis]] for [[WMS Industries|Williams Electronics]] and programmed by George Petro,<ref>{{cite web

It was one of the first ultra-violent video games and a frequent target of parental criticism of the [[video game industry]]. The object is to arrest and kill drug offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, and defeat "Mr. Big". It was the first game in the newly restarted Williams Electronics coin-op video game division.  Shortly before its release, Williams acquired the video and pinball divisions of [[Midway Games|Bally/Midway]].

''Narc'' was ported to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]. In 2005, the franchise was re-launched with a new game for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], which was released on March 22, 2005. A [[GameCube]] version of said game was planned, but was ultimately scrapped.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:ARC NARC (The Junkyard).png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]

The game's main characters are Max Force and Hit Man, who have received a memo from Spencer Williams, Narcotics Opposition chairman in [[Washington, D.C.]], dispatching them on Project NARC. Their mission is to apprehend Mr. Big, head of an [[organized crime|underground]] [[drug trafficking]] and [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization.

The player controls either Max Force or Hit Man, who shoot or arrest [[drug addiction|junkies]], drug dealers, and organized crime kingpins. Max and Hit are each equipped with an automatic weapon and a missile launcher. When an enemy is dispatched using the latter, they explode in a torrent of scorched and bloody appendages. Some enemies can be arrested after they surrender and then float away with "busted" over them. This is then added to a tally at the end of the level along with drugs and money confiscated from other enemies that they dropped when gunned down (the game awards more points at the end of a round for arresting enemies without killing them).

==Technical details==
The arcade game uses what is termed a "medium resolution monitor": higher resolution than televisions and normal arcade monitors, but in a smaller physical size.

''Narc'' is the first arcade game to use the Texas Instruments [[TMS34010]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} a 32-bit processor with graphics-oriented instructions built-in. It was later used in ''[[Smash TV]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', and ''[[NBA Jam]]''.

==Ports==
The August 1990 [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) version of ''NARC'', published by [[Acclaim Entertainment]] and developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] was billed as "the first video game with a strong anti-drug message,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-of-nintendo.com/manuals/nes/narc.shtml |title=NES Instruction Manuals: NARC |publisher=World-of-nintendo.com |date=1997-01-17 |access-date=2012-09-20}}</ref> though Nintendo forced all drug references to be removed from the actual gameplay. The game retained most of its violence and gore.

Most of the computer ports had their music ported by Tony Williams, credited as "Sound Images" and David Wise ported the arcade music to the NES.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Game Boy version of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' uses some music from ''NARC''.

==Reception==
{{Video game reviews
| award1Pub = ''Crash''
| award1 = Crash Smash<ref>Game review, Crash magazine, [[Newsfield Publications]], issue 83, December 1990</ref>
}}
All the versions of the game generally received positive reviews, being praised for its intense action and enjoyable gameplay, but criticism for its repetitiveness, including 9/10 from ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'', 8/10 from ''[[Sinclair User]]'' and 72% from ''[[Your Sinclair]]''. Matt Bielby of ''Your Sinclair'' called it "one of the most objectionable Speccy games I've seen in ages", and called it "repetitive" and the plot "utter nonsense."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/narc.htm |title=NARC |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |access-date=2012-09-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326130348/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/narc.htm |archive-date=2012-03-26 }}</ref> However, due to being one of the first games to feature blood, it has been a target of concerns and criticism from parents.

==Legacy==
In 1990, Acclaim released ''NARC'' as a handheld LCD game.

The main musical theme by [[Brian L. Schmidt]] was recorded by the band [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and released as a B-side to their "[[Planet of Sound]]" single in 1990.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pixiesmusic.com/song/theme-from-narc/ |title=Theme from Narc |access-date=2019-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520001700/http://www.pixiesmusic.com/song/theme-from-narc/ |archive-date=2015-05-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Max Force and villains Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead and Mr. Big appeared as characters in the cartoon ''[[The Power Team (TV series)|The Power Team]]'' and in the film ''[[22 Jump Street]]''.

''NARC'' is included in the ''[[Midway Arcade Treasures 2]]'' (2004) collection.

''NARC'' is a song on the soundtrack of [[Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number]], another ultra-violent video game.

===2005 game===
A 2005 sequel was developed by [[VIS Entertainment]] and published by [[Midway Games|Midway]] for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Microsoft Windows. The Windows version,  only released in Europe, was developed by [[Point of View (company)|Point of View]].

The game casts the players as narcotics officer Jack Forzenski (voiced by [[Michael Madsen]]) and DEA agent Marcus Hill (voiced by [[Bill Bellamy]]), former partners reunited who are instructed to investigate a new drug on the streets called Liquid Soul. After arresting [[drug dealer|dealer]]s and confiscating their stock, the player can either take the confiscated items to the evidence room, or keep them for future use. This confers benefits such as improved weapons accuracy. Dealing drugs for financial benefit is also possible.

A March 21, 2005, press release announced the game's shipment to retailers and emphasized that ''NARC'' was designed for an "older audience".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingexcellence.com/xbox/news/20050321627.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120013231/http://www.gamingexcellence.com/xbox/news/20050321627.shtml|archive-date=2008-11-20|title=Midway Ships NARC for the Xbox}}</ref> The game was given an [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|M rating]].
