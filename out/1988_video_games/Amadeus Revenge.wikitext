The player plays the part of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] or Amadeus as he is known in the game. The goal of the game is to complete Mozart's famous ''[[Piano Concerto No. 25 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 25]]'', ([[KÃ¶chel catalogue|K]]. 503), referred to in-game as simply ''Concerto in C''. To do this the player must navigate Amadeus across reams of [[sheet music]] while eliminating the conflicting notes produced by rival musicians such as [[Antonio Salieri]].<ref name=desimone>De Simone, Alessandro, ed.

Pg.106. 25 May 1988.</ref> As a rival musician produces a conflicting note it is reproduced within the game score at the appropriate tone.<ref name=boffard/>

==Reception==
Reviewing the game in 1988, ''Commodore Computer Club'' praised the game for its graphics and sound and for its ability to draw in players. They also included the game on Disc No.6 for subscribers belonging to the Commodore 64 Club.<ref name=desimone/> As part of its coverage of successful DIY projects in 2011, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' praised the game's "great use of the Commodore 64's sound chip".<ref name=boffard/> Australian news agency ''[[ABC Online]]'' noted that "while this modern interpretation of Mozart may seem a far stretch of the imagination, funnily enough it's an apt metaphor for what it's like to wander through an orchestra mid-performance".<ref>Staff.
