Brian Walker reviewed ''Backgammon'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it 2 stars out of 5, and stated that "To sum up; the program does not even reach intermediate level. Perhaps it might offer something if you learned the game over a plate of ''souvlaki'' and chips on a Greek island and wish to advance your understanding somewhat."<ref name="gi10">{{cite journal | last = Walker |first = Brian | title =Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 10 | pages =49 |date=November 1989}}</ref>

''[[The Games Machine]]'' found this game "dull" but conceded that it might be good for improving a player's skills at backgammon, but felt that players would have more fun on a real board.<ref name="TGM">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-18/page/n54/mode/2up|title=The Games Machine Issue 18}}</ref>

John Sweeney for ''[[Page 6]]'' found that this version of ''Backgammon'' was "probably best for beginners" due to the ability to set the difficulty level.<ref name="Page6">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Page6-51-Aug91/page/54/mode/2up|title = Page6 51 Aug91}}</ref>
