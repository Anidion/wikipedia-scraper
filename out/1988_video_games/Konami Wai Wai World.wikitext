{{nihongo|'''''Konami Wai Wai World'''''|コナミワイワイワールド|Konami Wai Wai Wārudo}}, "wai wai" being a Japanese [[onomatopoeia]] expressing a noisy or boisterous atmosphere, is a 1988 [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]] released only in Japan by [[Konami]]. The game itself stars various Konami-created characters as well as Mikey (from ''[[The Goonies]]'') and [[King Kong]], who appeared in two Konami-produced, film-based games.

==Gameplay==
The player starts the game as Konami Man and can switch between Konami Man and Konami Lady.<ref name="Famitsu"/> If two players are gaming, then one will play as Konami Man and the other as Konami Lady. Both players are not able to switch characters until they rescue at least one character from one of the six levels. The player must play through six different selectable levels that take place in different Konami games.<ref name="HG">http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/wai-wai-world/</ref> Subsequently, the player uses a key to save that game's star character, who then becomes playable. Each character has different abilities to begin with as well as ones they can eventually gain. The player ventures through these first six levels in a sort of nonlinear fashion with gameplay very similar to the original ''[[Castlevania]]'' games. After these stages are completed, the player plays through a scrolling space shooter stage and then a linear final stage.

The player can regularly visit the lab of Dr. Cinnamon (from the ''[[TwinBee]]'' series), who gives the player the game's character profiles and refills energy when needed. Through his lab, the player can talk to Saimon, Dr. Cinnamon's brother, who can resurrect any defeated characters at the cost of 100 bullets per character during the game.<ref name="HG"/>

==Music==
The music during gameplay depends on which character the player is playing as. Each character has their own music, which serves as their theme song. Besides Konami Man, Konami Girl and Moai, all the other characters use music from the Konami games they starred in. The different boss music in the game is also taken from Konami games in which the level is based.{{cn|date=June 2023}}

The mobile phone version of ''Wai Wai World'' replaces Mikey and King Kong with Upa (from ''[[Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa]]'') and a giant Penta (the protagonist from ''Antarctic Adventure'', and father of Pentarou), with their respective stages being a Candy stage and an Antarctic stage. These two characters from the original [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] version had been omitted due to licensing issues.<ref name="Famitsu"/>
