'''''Jetfighter''''' is a  series of 3D [[Combat flight simulation game|combat flight simulation computer games]] that was developed by [[Velocity Development]] starting in 1988.  The player would fly a combat jet aircraft in the skies against enemy forces. The game boasted 3D graphics that were cutting-edge at the time of the game's release, and used real-world terrain. The games seldom sold well because they occupied an uncomfortable middle ground of game design - too much [[flight simulator]] for action game fans, as they realistically emulated actual combat aircraft, but too simplistic for the hardcore sim fans, who always preferred games more along the lines of the [[Falcon (series)|Falcon]] series. The series ended after the commercial failure of ''Jetfighter 2015.''  The later games had support for [[3dfx]] Voodoo cards to run natively in DOS.

Jetfighter II was produced before the winner of the [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] competition was announced; the programmers chose to emulate the [[YF-23]] "Black Widow II" as the winning aircraft rather than the eventual winner, the YF-22 (which "entered service" in 2004 as the [[F-22 Raptor]]).

* ''Computer Gaming World'' stated that the game was much more difficult than its predecessor, and concluded that for those who did not attend [[United States Naval Aviator]] flight training, "this will probably be the closest they will ever get to landing on a carrier in a high-performance jet ... [it] does a great job of simulating both the difficulty and exhiliration a pilot experiences once he finally places his jet on the carrier deck".<ref name="hoover199111">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=88 | title=Soar on Drugs | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1991 | accessdate=November 18, 2013 | author=Hoover, Jim | pages=96}}</ref> A 1992 survey in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game three and a half stars out of five.<ref name="brooks199206">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1992 | accessdate=November 24, 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
