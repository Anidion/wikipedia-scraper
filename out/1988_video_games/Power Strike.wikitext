Power Strike
{{Short description|Video game series}}
'''''Power Strike''''' is a series of [[vertically scrolling shooter]] [[video games]], developed by [[Compile (publisher)|Compile]] for the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]]. It consists of three titles, only one of which was designed from the ground up as a ''Power Strike'' title. The other two are '''''[[Aleste (series)|Aleste]]''''' games re-branded for release outside of [[Japan]].

{{Main|Aleste}}

Originally released in Japan in 1988 under the name ''[[Aleste]]'', ''Power Strike'' is a slightly stripped-down version of the game released for international audiences in the same year. ''Power Strike'' contains one less level than ''Aleste'' and the anime-styled storyline was removed. In the United States, ''Power Strike'' is notable because it was the first mail-order only Master System title.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cornelius |first1=Dylan |title=Power Strike / Aleste |url=https://segadoes.com/2015/05/05/power-strike-aleste/ |website=Sega Does |accessdate=30 December 2019 |date=5 May 2015}}</ref> It was also the only title in the ''Power Strike'' series to be released in the United States. The US release was initially a mail-only limited edition, however it did later see some retail distribution at Toys R' Us and other American chains. The European release was always a regular retail package.

==''Power Strike II'' (Master System)==

''Power Strike II'', released in 1993 in Europe and Brazil for the Master System only, was the only game in the series designed from the ground up as a ''Power Strike'' game. It takes place in an alternate past in the 1930s, where players try to capture [[aerial pirates]] in [[Retrofuturism|retro-futuristic]] aircraft. The title plays similar to its predecessor, but adds a charged attack by holding the fire button.

==''Power Strike II'' (Game Gear)==

''Power Strike II'', released in 1993 in Europe and Brazil for the Game Gear, was originally released in Japan under the name of '''''GG Aleste II: Lance Bird'''''. It is the sequel to ''[[GG Aleste]]'' rather than a ''Power Strike'' title.
