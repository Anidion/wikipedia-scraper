==Gameplay==
''MacArthur's War: Battles for Korea'' is an operational-level simulation game in which the player is a Corps commander in a larger battle or in a series of skirmishes.<ref name="CGW61"/>

==Reception==
Jay C. Selover reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Despite the tremendous sweep of the maneuvers during the first year, Korea has never been a "pretty" war and has always been seriously under-represented in wargaming. This alone makes ''MacArthur's War'' almost a "must". That the game is a darn good simulation, is easy to learn, and gives you a real feeling for the capabilities and operational limitations of both sides is just an added bonus."<ref name="CGW61">{{cite magazine |last=Selover |first=Jay C. |title=Unparalleled Conflict: SSG's "MacArthur's War" |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=July 1989 |volume=1 |issue=61 |pages=19}}</ref>
