'''''Capitán Sevilla'''''{{efn|{{Lang-en|Captain Sevilla}}, also known as '''''Capitan Sevilla I''''' and '''''Captain 'S''''''.}} is a 1988 [[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed by the Spanish group Hi-Score and published by [[Dinamic Software]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. In the game, players assume the role of Mariano López, a transporter-turned [[superhero]] after eating a radiation-affected blood sausage to fight against the mad scientist Torrebruno and protect [[Earth]].

''Capitán Sevilla'' was conceived during the [[golden age of Spanish software]] under the working title ''Capitán Morcilla''{{efn|{{Lang-en|Captain Morcilla}}}} by director Álvaro Mateos, who developed titles published by Dinamic Software such as ''Rocky'' and ''[[West Bank (video game)|West Bank]]'' (1985), and formed Hi-Score as a game development group dedicated to [[microcomputer]]s with royalties obtained from his previous works. The idea originated from a [[comic strip]] by artist Angel Tirado during his high school days and the project initially started on the ZX Spectrum but went through a turbulent development cycle before its eventual launch to the market.

''Capitán Sevilla'' proved to be unsuccessful when it was published across Europe but received positive reception from critics across all platforms since its release; praise was given to its originality, audiovisual presentation and addictive gameplay but criticism was geared towards the high difficulty level and ending sequence. In recent years, fans have since experimented with remaking and porting the title to other platforms.

''Capitán Sevilla'' is a side-scrolling platform game where players assume the role of Mariano López, a transporter-turned superhero after eating a radiation-affected blood sausage to fight against the mad scientist Torrebruno and protect Earth.<ref name="MICMSXZXScs"/><ref name="MHZXScs"/><ref name="CSmanual">''Capitán Sevilla'' manual (ZX Spectrum, ESP)</ref><ref name="MH174">{{cite magazine|title=¡Dale Marcha A Tu Ordenador! - ¡Mas Alla De Superman! — Capitan Sevilla; Premiere: Capitan Sevilla|magazine={{ill|MicroHobby|lt=MicroHobby|es|MicroHobby}}|volume=5|issue=174|publisher=Hobby Press|date=July 1988|pages=[https://archive.org/stream/microhobby-magazine-174.pdf#page/n1/mode/1up 2], [https://archive.org/stream/microhobby-magazine-174.pdf#page/n21/mode/1up 20]|lang=es}}</ref> The game is divided into two phases and players must finish the first phase to obtain a password code and play the second phase via a "Double Load FX" system, as the [[cassette tape]] contained one phase on each side.<ref name="MHZXScs"/><ref name="CSmanual"/>

When López obtains a radioactive blood sausage and eats it, the players become Captain Sevilla and uses his superpowers: Superspush, which moves the enemies in front of Mariano; Supershot, which shoots blood sausages to defeat enemies; Superdefense, which renders Sevilla invulnerable for a brief time period; Superjump, which grants a much more powerful jump; Gliding, which allows López to fly around; and Superstrength, which gives players a blood sausage-shaped energy bar that decreases with enemy contact instead of dying upon first contact as López.<ref name="MICMSXZXScs"/><ref name="MHZXScs"/><ref name="CSmanual"/> Players can come across bonus rounds by exploring each stage, which require certain actions in order to complete them.<ref name="MICMSXZXScs"/>

Mariano López can move and jump but cannot be controlled after jumping.<ref name="MICMSXZXScs"/> If López collides with an obstacle during said jump, he continues in the opposite direction. López can also punch to get rid of enemies.<ref name="MHZXScs"/><ref name="CSmanual"/> There are numerous enemies, each with their own different characteristics as must be avoided, as they kill players at first contact when López is not in his Capitán Sevilla persona.<ref name="MHZXScs"/><ref name="CSmanual"/> Players are given a total of three lives and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]].<ref name="MHZXScs"/><ref name="CSmanual"/>

''Capitán Sevilla'' was developed during the [[golden age of Spanish software]] under the working title ''Capitán Morcilla'' by Hi-Score, a Spanish game development group dedicated to [[microcomputer]]s formed by director Álvaro Mateos, who previously worked on titles published by [[Dinamic Software]] such as ''Rocky'' and ''[[West Bank (video game)|West Bank]]'' (1985).<ref name="CSmanual"/><ref name="FA">{{cite web|url=https://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film383805.html|title=¡No nos gusta Capitán Morcilla!

Mateos decided to form the group using royalties obtained from his previous works and placed advertisements across universities to recruit people with programming and graphic design experience for [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]].<ref name="FA"/><ref name="EDes"/><ref name="RGes23"/> Mateos and the staff rented an apartment in [[Triana, Seville]] to covert the floor into an office, acquired computers and development tools, assigning roles according to the abilities of each member, naming their team as Hi-Score and starting work on ''Capitán Morcilla''.<ref name="FA"/><ref name="EDes"/><ref name="RGes23"/> The idea originated from a comic strip of the same name created by lead graphic designer Angel Tirado during his high school period, with its script being used as basis, and Mateos proposed the project to Dinamic.<ref name="FA"/><ref name="EDes"/><ref name="RGes23"/> Due to Mateos' contacts, Dinamic would be in charge of publishing the game.<ref name="FA"/>

The base version Hi-Score worked with to create ''Capitán Sevilla'' was the ZX Spectrum.<ref name="RGes23"/> Due to memory constrains, Tirado stated that tricks were necessary to fit "everything together" and the team decided to make the visuals monochrome except the marker area.
<ref name="RGes23"/> Screen scroll was also scrapped in favor of fixed scenes to increase detail for both characters and stage elements.<ref name="RGes23"/> Tirado also implemented a technique based on a comic book guide by [[José Beá]] to transpose the hand-drawn artwork from paper into [[pixel art]], in order to process and store graphic information on the computer.<ref name="RGes23"/> Rodríguez stated that the title was "a two-dimensional game with three-dimensional aspects", as there were objects located in a closer plane to achieve a pseudo-3D effect. Rodríguez also stated that the team had to use image masking for objects to make them act "as if it were transparent and the character passed in front of it". "Macedo" Jiménez was in charge of the character animations, focusing on parabolic movements for the flight of the character.<ref name="RGes23"/>

Development lasted more than a year and a half with a personnel between thirteen and fourteen members but proved to be chaotic, as the team missed the scheduled 1987 Christmas release campaign and left their apartment due to Mateos running out of money to pay the rent and pending bills.<ref name="EDes"/><ref name="RGes23"/> Both the CPC and [[MSX]] versions were created later during development but proved to be complicated and tensions arose.<ref name="FA"/><ref name="RGes23"/> Mateos stated that "everything went to hell" due to his lifestyle compared to people of his young age.<ref name="EDes"/> Dinamic co-founder Victor Ruiz claimed that his company did not intervene in the game's development aside from the cover art design and its title, which was renamed as ''Capitán Sevilla'' due to marketing reasons despite opposition from Hi-Score staff.<ref name="FA"/><ref name="EDes"/><ref name="RGes23"/> Following advice from Tirado, Dinamic brought Max to draw the cover art as well as redesign his comic strip and Mariano López.<ref name="FA"/><ref name="EDes"/><ref name="RGes23"/> After the title was published, Hi-Score was disbanded and each member went separate ways, either within the [[video game industry]] or other sectors.<ref name="FA"/>
