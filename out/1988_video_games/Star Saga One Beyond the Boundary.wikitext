==Reception==
''Star Saga'' was hailed as being completely new and different from games which came before. The ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' review of the first title summarizes this sentiment as "''Star Saga: One - Beyond the Boundary'' is probably the most unique and well-written role-playing experience yet to appear in a computer game". The same reviewer noted that it was easy to lose track of time playing "just one more turn" due to the deep experiences provided by the game.<ref name="cgw1" /> In 1989 the magazine gave ''Star Saga One'' a Special Award for Literary Achievement.<ref name="CGW2">{{citation | date = October 1989 | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Game of the Year Awards | pages = 8}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' was less favorable, describing the game as "far more a social event than a computer game". The magazine stated that "it's lackluster without interaction" with other players, and described the user interface as "almost crude by today's standards".<ref name="keiser198808">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-08-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_099_1988_Aug#page/n61/mode/2up | title=Star Saga: One—Beyond the Boundary | work=Compute! | date=August 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Keiser, Gregg | pages=60}}</ref> ''Star Saga One: Beyond the Boundary'' was reviewed in 1989 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #142 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column.

Jeff Donahue for ''[[Family Computing]]'' said "''Star Saga'' is light-years ahead of the "which-way" adventures."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/family-computing-61|title=Family Computing Magazine Issue 61|date=September 30, 1988|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
