'''''Thud Ridge: American Aces in 'Nam''''' is a [[computer game]] published by [[Three-Sixty Pacific]] in 1988 for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[MS-DOS]].

==Plot==
''Thud Ridge'' is a combat flight simulator that allows the player to pilot a [[Republic Aviation|Republic]] [[F-105 Thunderchief]]—also known as a "Thud"—during the [[Vietnam War]]. The player must contend with enemy [[Mikoyan|MiGs]], [[Surface-to-air missile|SAMs]], [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]], and a MiG ace pilot called the Grey Ghost. ''Thud Ridge'' includes 10 missions, and players determine the level of simulation difficulty by choosing from Lieutenant, Captain, or Colonel level. The player earns the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] by completing Missions 1 through 3, the [[Silver Star]] and a promotion to Colonel by completing Missions 4 through 6, and membership in the Wild Weasel Thud Drivers if the player completes all ten missions.<ref name="Dragon151"/>

==Gameplay==
''Thud Ridge'' uses few commands to operate the aircraft. It does not have digitized sound, but beeps indicate actions such as weapons firing. The player controls the flight of the aircraft using a joystick or keypad, and the player uses the keyboard to control other functions. The game has four basic screens that show different aspects of the jet and its flight. One screen allows the player to view the aircraft functions. The main display includes a real-time view of the Thud and the surrounding geography, and also the weapons and firing information. The plane uses an automatic weapons cursor, which changes shape to match the weapon in use. The Engine Function Panel can appear beneath the real-time graphics display, and presents gauges which show the engine and nozzle temperatures and fuel levels, as well as data such as the throttle of the plane, an indicated for the afterburner, the mission time elapsed, a warning for radar-lock, and a graphic display showing the Thud and its remaining weapons. One more screen shows where SAM installations can be found, and another screen shows a map.<ref name="Dragon151"/>
