'''''OsWALD''''', also known as '''''OsWALD Of The Ice Floes''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hol.abime.net/2326|title = OsWALD of the Ice Floes : Hall of Light - the database of Amiga games}}</ref> is a 1988 Danish computer game for [[Amiga]] and [[Commodore 64]]. The game was designed by Ivan Sølvason for use as a game controlled over a [[push-button telephone]], for [[TV 2 (Denmark)|Danish TV2]]'s Friday night prime time program Eleva2ren. The game sold well in Denmark due to the exposure in Eleva2ren.<ref name="slides">{{Cite web |last=Sølvason |first=Ivan |title=OsWALD og Hugo: Verdens første interaktive TV udsendelser |trans-title=OsWALD and Hugo: The world's first interactive TV broadcasts |url=https://datamuseum.dk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/OsWALD-og-Hugo-pr%C3%A6sentation.pdf |website=Dansk Datahistorisk Forening |language=da}}</ref>

Sølvason later designed ''[[Hugo (franchise)|Hugo the TV Troll]]'', also for Eleva2ren and using the same push-button telephone concept.

==Sequel==
A new version of the game named '''''Super OsWALD''''', with a two-player mode, was created for Eleva2ren in 1989.<ref name="slides" />
