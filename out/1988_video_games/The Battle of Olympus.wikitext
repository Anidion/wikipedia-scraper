A port for the [[Game Boy]] was also released.

== Plot ==
''The Battle of Olympus'' takes place in an [[ancient Greece]] which is being terrorized by [[Hades]], the dark ruler of the [[underworld]].

Helene, the girlfriend of [[Orpheus]], is kidnapped by Hades who is holding her captive. A top-down map of Greece shows various dungeons and ancient Greek city-states for the player to visit on their journey. [[Sword]]s, [[shield]]s, and [[crystal]]s help to provide offensive power and defensive strength for the player. Three fragments of love are there to remind Orpheus of his girlfriend Helene. Hades rules his dominion in [[Tartarus]], where his strongest minions live alongside him.

During his adventure, Orpheus needs to meet the [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]] and gain their favor, starting with [[Zeus]], the leader of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]], who encourages the other gods to grant Orpheus powers. These powers are in the form of a weapon, a shield, and other special equipment, among them a harp, which summons [[Pegasus]] to carry Orpheus to far locations. As the game progresses, players are exposed to various forms of upgraded weaponry. The player starts off with a basic wooden club. The player later obtains items such as the Staff of Fennel (also known as a [[thyrsus]], which is able to project a fireball), Nymph's Sword, and the Divine Sword (able to project a lightning bolt).

The game features encounters with mythological creatures such as the [[Taurus (constellation)#Mythology|Taurus]], [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]], [[cyclops]], [[centaur]], [[Talos]], [[Minotaur]], [[Graeae]], [[Cerberus]], [[Stymphalian birds]], [[Nemean lion]], and also a [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]. Players must fight their way deep into the [[underworld]], fight and defeat [[Hades]], and finally save Helene. Several items depicted in the Greek mythology are acquired, such as the Harp of Apollo, the Sword of [[Hephaestus]], the Staff of [[Prometheus]], and the Sandals of [[Hermes]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:The_Battle_of_Olympus.png|250px|thumb|Screenshot of the game|alt=|left]]
Primarily a sidescroller with some light platforming, the player is a hero with a sword and shield, while just a handful of secondary items come along later in the game, mostly for the purpose of advancement as the protagonist move to new areas. He can find upgrades to maximize health, protection, and speed. The biggest differences in combat from Zelda II are the lack of the downward stab in midair, and the lack of the sword beam at full health. However, ''The Battle of Olympus'' does have a sword later in the game that can shoot beams, but doing so damages the [[health bar]] if a certain item is not found first.

''The Battle of Olympus'' is somewhat non-linear and there are some optional side quests that can make the game easier in the long run, leading to a secret item or power-up from one of the gods.

The final battle brings to the Temple of Hades in fight with the ruler of the underworld in a two-stage event. The first is a blind fight against a shadow reflection, and then the final form is of Hades himself.
