'''''MicroProse Soccer''''' is an [[List of association football video games|association football video game]] published by [[MicroProse]] in 1988.<ref>[http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/microprosesoccer.htm Microprose Soccer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225220452/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/microprosesoccer.htm |date=2007-12-25}} at ysrnry.co.uk</ref> The original [[Commodore 64]] version was developed by [[Sensible Software]] and ported to other systems. In the [[United States]], the game was released as '''''Keith Van Eron's Pro Soccer''''', named after [[Keith Van Eron]].<ref name='rgmakingofmicroprosesoccer' />

Designed by [[Jon Hare]] and programmed by Chris Yates, they adapted the gameplay format of [[arcade video game]] ''[[Tehkan World Cup]]'' (1985) while adding their own elements to create ''MicroProse Soccer''. It is the forerunner of the 16-bit ''[[Sensible Soccer]]'' series.

== Gameplay ==
The game can simulate a full 11-a-side game of football on a grass pitch, or 6-a-side  soccer,<ref>[http://homepages.tesco.net/~parsonsp/html/microprose_soccer.html Microprose Soccer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222184056/http://homepages.tesco.net/~parsonsp/html/microprose_soccer.html |date=2007-12-22}} at homepages.tesco.net/~parsonsp</ref> based on the American indoor league of the time.

A single player can work through a World Cup (or Indoor League) tournament, or take on a series of increasingly tougher computer teams. A two-player friendly can be played head to head.

The control method was designed to be as simple as possible, lending itself to fast and flowing football (in the manner of the later ''[[Sensible Soccer]]''). A quick tap of the fire button passed forward, a longer hold of the button chipped the ball at height. Pushing backwards and fire did an overhead kick. Pushing forwards and fire took a shot.

Most unusual was the "banana kick", the strength of which could be varied among three settings in the options menu. By pushing diagonally as a shot was taken, the ball would swerve in the air to get round defenders and goalkeeper. Rival game ''[[Kick Off (series)|Kick Off]]'' would also add this after-touch feature.

Most versions featured a simulated "action replay" after a goal was scored, with the C64 version featuring black & white stripes to resemble a video rewinding.

==Development==
The game was designed by [[Jon Hare]] and programmed by Chris Yates. Hare cited the [[arcade video game]] ''[[Tehkan World Cup]]'', released by [[Tehkan]] (Tecmo) in 1985, as the basis and the inspiration for the game.<ref name="Retro">{{cite magazine |title=The Sensible Game: Jon Hare Reveals the Drive and Inspiration – Direct and Indirect – For the Beautiful Game That Became Sensible Soccer |magazine=[[GamesTM|Retro: The Ultimate Retro Companion from Games<sup>TM</sup>]] |date=2010 |volume=3 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=224-231 (228-9) |url=https://issuu.com/topov81/docs/retro_volume_3/228}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=In the chair with...

Preview pictures of the game appeared in an issue of ''[[Zzap!64]]'' magazine, with a plea for a publisher to come forward.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The Electronic Pencil Company ported the game to the Amiga and Atari ST. The programmer created a 6502 emulator, transferring the game code and logic to the 16-bit machines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}
