In August 1988, the game was ported to the [[PC Engine]] console,<ref name="gamefaqs_court">{{cite web|title=World Court Tennis|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589168-world-court-tennis/data|publisher=[[GameFAQs]]|accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref> in which a new tennis-based [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] quest mode was added,<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Patterson|first=Eric L.|title=5 WAYS JAPANESE GAMING STILL RULES: ATELIER TOTORI|url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/egm-feature5-ways-japanese-gaming-still-rules-atelier-totori/|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|accessdate=31 December 2011|date=December 27, 2011|archive-date=29 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929220550/http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/egm-feature5-ways-japanese-gaming-still-rules-atelier-totori/|url-status=dead}}</ref> and was later ported to the North American [[TurboGrafx-16]] console by [[NEC]] under the title of '''''World Court Tennis''''' in 1989.<ref name="gamefaqs_court"/> Up to four players could play simultaneously. A sequel named ''[[Super World Court]]'' was released in 1992, which ran on [[Namco NA-1]] hardware and allowed up to four players to play simultaneously. The arcade version was released on the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] as part of the [[Arcade Archives]] lineup on May 12, 2022 worldwide.

==Gameplay==
At the start of the game the players must select either "singles" (Player 1 v Player 2) or "doubles" (Player Team v CPU Team); they must then select one of twenty different players (ten male, eight female and two robot) before selecting one of three different courts ([[New York City]] hard, [[London]] lawn, and [[Paris]] clay). They must then select whether they want the match to be one or three sets long - and, once they have done so, their two (or four) chosen players will come out, and take their positions on the court. The players must use an eight-way joystick to direct their chosen players around their half of the court and two buttons to hit the ball with their rackets, but just like in a real tennis match, faults, net balls and deuce can occur, although the "Deuce" setting in the options menu can be turned off.

==Reception==
The game received positive reviews from critics. ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine reviewed the PC Engine version, rating it 94% in 1989 and stating up to "four players can play simultaneously in this utterly incredible tennis game" with "huge lasting appeal".<ref name="CVG">{{cite journal |title=Complete Games Guide |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref> ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' magazine reviewed the PC Engine version in 1989, rating it 935 out of 1000 and listing it as the third best game available for the console, after ''[[R-Type]]'' and ''[[Final Lap Twin]]''. They said ''World Tennis'' was "the PC Engine at its sporting best" and that it "has everything" including "superb" graphics, top spin, drop shots, volleys, convincing "3D screen separation" and "an arcade adventure" mode.<ref name="ACE">{{cite magazine |title=Console Wars |magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]] |date=October 1989 |issue=26 (November 1989) |page=144 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/d/d9/ACE_UK_26.pdf#page=144}}</ref>
