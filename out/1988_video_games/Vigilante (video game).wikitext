{{nihongo|'''''Vigilante'''''|ビジランテ}} is a 1988 [[beat 'em up]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Irem]] in Japan and Europe, and published in North America by [[Data East]]. It is considered as a [[spiritual sequel]] to Irem's earlier ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' (1984).

==Plot==
The game takes place in downtown [[New York City]]. The game's plot involves a lone, professional martial artist who became a vigilante to fight an evil gang called the Skinheads ruled by a man known as the Giant Devil, in order to protect his "turf" and save a female hostage named Madonna, who was kidnapped by them.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Vigilante1.png|left|thumb|Arcade version]]
Players control the titular character using punches and kicks to defeat the Skinheads in a 2D platform manner, while sometimes picking up and using [[nunchaku]] against them. If players get hurt while holding nunchuku, they become unarmed. There are five stages in order of appearance: a street, a junkyard, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], a back street scene and on top of a building that is under construction. Skinheads with Mohawk or spiked hairdo attack the vigilante with knives, chains, motorbikes, guns and other kinds of weapons. They will also choke him if he lets them get too close.

==Development==
An arcade sequel to ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' called ''Beyond Kung-Fu: Return of the Master'' was developed by Irem and underwent location testing in 1987, but was shelved after it underperformed. The ''Kung-Fu'' sequel was then revamped into ''Vigilante'', after Irem decided to give the game a more Americanized setting, which was released in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/blog_post/long-lost-kung-fu-master-sequel-found//|title=Long Lost Kung-Fu Master Sequel Found|date=29 April 2015}}</ref>

==Ports==
The arcade game was later ported to several different home computers and consoles. The [[Master System]] version was published exclusively in North America and Europe by [[Sega]], and is one of several games in the console to include an FM sound switch for enhanced music quality. In the Master System version, Madonna was renamed "Maria" and the Skinheads were called the "Rogues".<ref>http://segaretro.org/images/9/9e/Vigilante_sms_us_manual.pdf</ref>

The ones for [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]] and the [[Amstrad CPC]] were reprogrammed by [[Emerald Software]] and published by [[U.S. Gold]] mostly in Europe. The [[MSX]] version was ported and published by [[Korea]]n company Clover.<ref>[http://www.generation-msx.nl/index.php?url=/msxdb/index?publisher_select=629&op=search Clover at Generation MSX - Software Database.] Date retrieved October 31, 2009.</ref>

The [[TurboGrafx-16]] version was ported and published in Japan on January 14, 1989 by Irem and published in North America by [[NEC]] the same year. This port matches the arcade more than other ports. The TurboGrafx-16 version was later re-released globally for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Console]] for the [[Wii]] in February 2007 for North America,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com:80/games/gameGuide?download=classic&age=18&page=17&view=grid&sort=&source=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204214244/http://www.nintendo.com:80/games/gameGuide?download=classic&age=18&page=17&view=grid&sort=&source=|archive-date=2011-12-04|title=Game Guide - Nintendo Game Store}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/v0KnrVb9sI9p1kuJzlCTOd5EnCF3O-7i#game-info|title = Nintendo - Official Site - Video Game Consoles, Games - Nintendo - Official Site}}</ref> Japan,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/software/02.html|title = Wii &#124; Virtual Console バーチャルコンソール}}</ref> and Europe,<ref name="VC Europe"/> with the exception of [[Australia]] on July 6, but was delisted in March 2012 before it returned in September 2013.

''[[Your Sinclair]]'' gave the arcade game a positive review, stating it was "a pretty good game" with "loads" of enemies, "crunchingly realistic" sound effects, "beautifully detailed" sprite graphics and "really smooth" movement animation.<ref name="YS"/> They later described the ZX Spectrum version as a "pretty standard beat 'em up" that "you've probably seen" before, saying players should "only buy if you're addicted to the genre and you've already got the better ones".<ref name="ysr"/>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the PC Engine version a positive review, stating it was "a good game, even second time" around, the graphics are "perfectly defined and beautifully" animated, and that "any beat 'em up fan should check out ''Vigilante'' without delay".<ref name="CVG90"/>
