'''''Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax''''' is a [[video game]] first published in 1988 for various [[home computer]]s. It was released as '''''Axe of Rage''''' in North America. The game is the sequel to ''[[Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior]]'' (''Death Sword'' in North America), which was published in 1987. In ''Barbarian II'', the player controls a princess or barbarian character, exploring the game world to locate and defeat an evil wizard. The game's plot is an extension of its predecessor, although the gameplay is different. While the first game offers two players the opportunity for virtual head-to-head combat, the second is a single-player [[beat 'em up]] with fewer fighting moves. It uses a [[flip-screen]] style instead of scrolling.

[[Palace Software]], the developer of the two ''Barbarian'' games, marketed the sequel with the same strategy they used for the first game. They hired [[Maria Whittaker]], a model known for her topless work, to pose on the cover and posters as the princess in the game, attempting to recapture the controversy that had boosted sales. ''Barbarian II'' received a mixed critical reception. Reviewers were split in their opinions over whether the game was a refreshing and gory adventure, or a boring and lonely sojourn through a confusing digital world.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Barbarian II (Palace Software) - Gameplay.png|thumb|left|alt=A digital representation of a barbarian, wearing only a loincloth, holds his axe at the ready as a big humanoid monster kicks him.  On the top left and right corners of the screen are gauges that depict the lives of the combatants.  The word "Barbarian II" lies in the top centre with five globes under it and placed between small pictures of a wizard and the barbarian. The player's score is displayed in the lower right corner. The lower centre of the screen depicts a sword that acts as a compass. The lower left panel shows items collected by the player character.|''Barbarian II'' adopted an adventure format in which the protagonist explores locales to reach his goal, fighting monsters in his way.]]
Unlike its predecessor which offers sword fighting action to one or two players, ''Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax'' features only a single-player mode, in which the player assumes the role of either sword-wielding Princess Mariana or the titular savage, who is armed with a battleaxe.<ref name=cvg82>{{cite journal

== Development ==
''Barbarian II''{{'}}s predecessor, ''Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior'', was a critical and commercial success on its release in 1987. Reviewers enjoyed the game's exciting sword fights, and its profile was greatly enhanced by marketing strategies employed by its developer, [[Palace Software]], a subsidiary of media company Palace Group. The developer had engaged [[Maria Whittaker]], a model known for topless shoots, to pose on the box covers and posters of the game. The image of a bikini-clad Whittaker created a hype that pushed the game beyond the attention of the video game industry, producing a controversy in which members of the public criticised the industry for promoting ''Barbarian'' in a [[Sexism#Sexual objectification|sexist manner]].<ref name=aui /><ref name=retro23>{{cite journal

Palace Software repeated the strategy for the sequel,<ref name=aui /> publishing a poster of Whittaker as Princess Mariana, this time in metal bikini armour, and [[Michael Van Wijk]] as the barbarian.<ref>{{cite journal

</ref> Steve Brown, creator of the ''Barbarian'' games, recalled that the bikini's chain "snapped a number of times" in a comical ''[[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]]'' fashion during the shoot.<ref name=retro23 /> Brown was behind the concept of the poster, which was brought to fruition by Lee Gibbons, a commercial artist, over the course of four weeks. The image of the barbarian and princess poised over the fallen body of a large, scaly monster was a [[photomontage]], created by superimposing three photographs&mdash;one of each subject&mdash;on one another. The creature was a small scale model made of [[Plasticine]]. After cutting out the subjects from their photos and composing the cut-outs to form a new scene, Gibbons painted the background and added effects such as smoke to form the final image.<ref name=cvg81 />

[[File:Eadweard Muybridge - Athletes. Walking High Leap.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Nine photographs, arranged in 3 rows of 3, show the sequence of a man's jump over a hurdle. The first photo at the top left shows the man in front of a hurdle with his right leg raised. As he propels himself over the hurdle, he pulls his trailing left leg up and in front of him while pushing his arms to the back. The last three photos show him as he clears the hurdle and lands on both feet.|The movements of ''Barbarian II''{{'}}s characters were copied from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s work, similar to his sequence of a man's jump over a hurdle.]]
Brown had filmed sword fights and used the tracings of the combatants' movements to produce the animations in ''Barbarian''. For the animations in the sequel, he turned to the works of photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]], who made a name for himself through his series of photographs of animals and humans captured in motion. The movements of ''Barbarian II''{{'}}s characters were based on the pictures in Muybridge's book ''Human in Motion'',<ref>{{cite journal

</ref> Horgan had another grouse with the combat, moaning the loss of simplicity from the ''Barbarian'' series. According to him, while players could enjoy the first ''Barbarian'' game without much effort, intense practise was needed to defeat the monsters in the second game.<ref name=aui />

The change in combat systems was not the only difference between ''Barbarian II'' and its predecessor that influenced reviewers' opinions about the sequel. The first ''Barbarian'' game was enjoyed by reviewers for providing exciting head-to-head action between two players. ''Barbarian II'' abandoned this, setting up an adventuring experience for the single player. Jim Douglas, reviewing for ''Sinclair User'', doubted that players who were looking for quick action would appreciate plotting a path through the maze to reach the final goal.<ref name=sinuser81 /> ''Your Sinclair''{{'}}s Marcus Berkmann felt the two genres&mdash;slash 'em up and arcade adventure&mdash;were "fundamentally incompatible", agreeing with Douglas that the maze was a distraction.<ref name=ysreview>{{cite journal

==Legacy==
After ''Barbarian II'' was released, Palace Software went ahead with plans for ''Barbarian III''. For two years, the third game in the series was publicised in gaming magazines. ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' held a contest for its readers, asking them to submit concepts of gruesome monsters. The winning entry would be implemented in ''Barbarian III''. The ''Barbarian'' series of games were, however, brought to a halt in 1991 when Palace Group sold its software subsidiary to fund its expansion into the movie industry.  [[Titus Software]] bought Palace Software and after reviewing its holdings, cancelled several of its new acquisition's projects, including ''Barbarian III''.<ref name=retro23 />
