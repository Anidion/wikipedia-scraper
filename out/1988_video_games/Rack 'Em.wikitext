==Reception==
The game received a score of 708/1000 from ''[[ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment)|ACE]]'' magazine in March 1989, which described the game as having "pretty realistic" [[game physics]]. However, the game does not have opponent [[artificial intelligence]] to play against, and ''ACE'' described this omission as the "sole disappointing aspect of Rack 'Em".<ref name="ACE">{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-18/ACE_Issue_18_1989_Mar#page/n62/mode/1up | title=Rack 'Em reviewed on IBM PC | author=Jarratt, Steve | journal=[[Advanced Computer Entertainment]] | date=March 1989 | volume=Issue 18 | issue=March, 1989 | pages=64 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007232121/https://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-18/ACE_Issue_18_1989_Mar#page/n62/mode/1up | archivedate=2016-10-07 }}</ref>
