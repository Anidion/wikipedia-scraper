''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]''{{'}}s reviewer The Pilgrim called it "a game that combines powerful programming, wry humour, and a compelling plot all at once. No doubt about it, ''Corruption'' is [[Magnetic Scrolls]]' best yet."<ref name=ace /> In ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', Keith Campbell wrote that "the game has very much the same feel as the Infocom mysteries, like ''Suspect'', although I found this plot to be far more interesting." He remarked that ''Corruption'' will provide "hours of enjoyable frustration", and he praised its graphics, noting that "an adventure set in offices in the city, doesn't sound particularly exciting graphically, yet Magnetic Scrolls have made it so."<ref name=cvg />

''[[Sinclair User]]''{{'}}s Sarah Sharkey summarized, "[T]his game is good. The text is well written, the characters are very realistic and the storyline is believable." She highlighted the game's "super interaction with characters" and "absorbing and realistic game world".<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{Cite journal|title=''Corruption''|journal=[[Sinclair User]]|date=October 1988 | issue=79 | page=48 | author=Sharkey, Sarah}}</ref> Mike Gerrard of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' wrote, "All in all, I enjoyed ''Corruption'' far more than I thought I would... but not quite as much as the previous Magnetic Scrolls games."<ref name="Your Sinclair Review">{{Cite journal|title=''Corruption''|journal=[[Your Sinclair]]|date=November 1988 | issue=35 | page=104 | author=Gerrard, Mike}}</ref>

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1989 praised the game's menu features, such as the ability to reveal exits.<ref name="CGW"/> [[Charles Ardai]] in 1992 wrote in the magazine that ''Corruption'' was "the one clear winner" in the ''Magnetic Scrolls Collection''. While criticizing the short length of gameplay, he stated that "a game this powerful deserves the widest possible audience".<ref name="ardai199211">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100 | title=Virgin Software's Magnetic Scrolls Collection | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1992 | access-date=4 July 2014 | last=Ardai | first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Ardai | issue=56 | pages=64}}</ref>
