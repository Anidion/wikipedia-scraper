'''''Hoppin' Mad''''' is an [[action game]] released in 1988 by [[Elite Systems]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]

The game takes place over 12 levels. On each level, the player has to guide a group of [[bouncing ball]]s from the right edge of the level to the left edge. The balls are constantly bouncing, and the player can only alter their travel speed (by moving the [[joystick]] left or right) or make them bounce higher (by pressing the fire button). The objective of the game is to collect ten [[balloon]]s; doing so will advance the player to the next level.

Various different dangers appear on the levels, including sharp [[rock (geology)|rock]]s, [[venus flytrap]]s, [[hedgehog]]s and flying [[bird]]s. The game starts with four balls, and each time the balls collide with a dangerous object, one ball bursts. If all four balls are burst, the player loses a life.

Elite Systems developed an [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version which was never released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unseen64.net/2008/11/08/hoppin-mad-nes-unreleased|title=Hoppin Mad &#91;NES - Unreleased&#93; - Unseen64|date=8 November 2008}}</ref>
