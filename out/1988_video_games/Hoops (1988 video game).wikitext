The game is done in a half court style<ref name="Eddy1">{{cite journal |last1=Eddy |first1=Andy |last2=Kunkel |first2=Bill |title=AN ALL-STAR TEAM OF SPORTS VIDEO GAMES |journal=Boys Life |date=November 1989 |volume=79 |issue=11 |pages=28–29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GYEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Hoops%22+%22Jaleco%22&pg=PA11 |accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref> with the player having a choice to disable or enable winners outs. No fouls are called. There is also an [[Around the World (basketball)|around the world]] mode that allows players to focus on making baskets without worrying about the charging, pushing, and traveling fouls that are found in the standard mode of play. Similar to [[Double Dribble (video game)|Double Dribble]] the game features slow-motion sequences when the player goes for a dunk, though these can be blocked.<ref name="Scullion1">{{cite book |last1=Scullion |first1=Chris |title=The NES Encyclopedia: Every Game Released for the Nintendo Entertainment System |date=30 March 2019 |publisher=Pen & Sword |isbn=978-1526737823 |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcGnDwAAQBAJ&q=%22Hoops%22+%22Jaleco%22&pg=PA93 |accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref>

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were broadly positive. ''[[Boys' Life|Boy's Life]]'' magazine described it as offering "tough one-on-one or two-on-two action".<ref name="Eddy1" />  A 1989 review for the ''Battle Creek Enquirer'' written by Matt Neapolitan praised the game as "one of the best basketball games for Nintendo.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neapolitan |first1=Matt |title=Video Games |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25426989/battle-creek-enquirer/ |accessdate=16 November 2020 |work=Battle Creek Enquirer |date=25 June 1989 |page=87}}</ref>

Retrospective reviews have been more mixed. Writing in 2002, video games historian Andy Slaven described it as "boring with predictable opponent movements".<ref name="Slaven1">{{cite book |last1=Slaven |first1=Andy |title=Video Game Bible, 1985-2002 |date=2002 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |isbn=1553697316 |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnPRd6QwvbQC&q=%22Hoops%22+%22Jaleco%22&pg=PA108 |accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref> Brett Weiss, writing in 2012, described it as "old fashioned [but] a lot of fun".<ref name="Weiss1" />
