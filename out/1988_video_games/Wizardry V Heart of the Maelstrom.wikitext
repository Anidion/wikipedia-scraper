'''''Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom''''' is the fifth scenario in the ''[[Wizardry]]'' series of [[role-playing video game]]s. It was published in 1988 by [[Sir-Tech]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II]], and [[IBM PC compatible]]s (as a [[self-booting disk]]) . A port for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] and [[FM Towns]] was later developed and published by [[ASCII (company)|ASCII Entertainment]] in [[Japan]]. ''Wizardry V'' was released in the US for the Super NES by Capcom in 1993, and subsequently re-released for the [[Satellaview]] subsystem under the name ''BS Wizardry 5''.

==Plot==
Following from the events of ''[[Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn]]'', ''Heart of the Maelstrom'' begins after a period of peace brought about through the use of L'Kbreth's Orb is shattered when the powers of chaos literally begin to emerge into the world. These unnatural energies are especially focused in a series of tunnels beneath the Temple of Sages in Llylgamyn, fittingly called the Maelstrom. Adventurers, namely the player party, are recruited to journey into these caverns and track down a means of summoning a being known as the Gatekeeper who can seal these chaotic energies once more. Unfortunately, he has been imprisoned by a rogue sorceress known as the Sorn.

The party begins by searching for G'bli Gedook, a high priest and guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb. He instructs the party to venture deeper into the caverns. After traversing down to the eighth floor, the party must appease four beings known as the Card Lords by bringing them their respective [[suit (cards)|suit]]. Once this task is accomplished, the party can venture to the Heart of the Maelstrom and the Gatekeeper may be summoned. As this occurs, the Sorn and her own party of adventurers strike, prompting a final battle. With her defeat, the Gatekeeper awards the party the Heart of Abriel. They return with this to the surface and order is restored to Llylgamyn.

==Development==
''Wizardry V''{{'}}s design was based on a game that Bradley had previously written and pitched to Sir-Tech.  Sir-Tech asked Bradley to rewrite the game to fit into the ''Wizardry'' franchise.  This was finished in 1986, but ''Wizardry V'' was held back for two years while ''[[Wizardry IV: The Return of Werdna]]'' was completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rpgvault.ign.com/features/interviews/wizwar.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010217041727/http://rpgvault.ign.com/features/interviews/wizwar.shtml|title=Wizards & Warriors Interview|work=[[IGN]]|date=2000-07-13|archive-date=2001-02-17|url-status=dead|access-date=2016-11-07}}</ref>

After ''Wizardry IV''—which did not upgrade its graphics from [[Wizardry I|the first game in the series]]—sold very poorly,<ref name="maher20140625">{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2014/06/of-wizards-and-bards/ | title=Of Wizards and Bards | work=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2014-06-25 | access-date=11 July 2014 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref> Sir-Tech advertised ''Wizardry V'' as "breaking away from the Wizardry system of the past".<ref name="cgw199311">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=112 | title=Buy the Best of '93 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1993 | issue=112 | access-date=28 March 2016 | pages=9 | type=advertisement}}</ref>

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1989 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #145 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon145">{{cite magazine |title=The Role of Computers |url=https://archive.org/details/DragonMagazine260_201801/DragonMagazine145/page/n45/mode/1up |last1=Lesser |last2=Lesser |last3=Lesser |first1=Hartley |first2=Patricia |first3=Kirk |magazine=Dragon |issue=145 |date=May 1989 |pages=44–53 }}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s Dennis Owens in 1989 noted the game's similarity to the first three games, saying, "''Heart of the Maelstrom'' is, at once, both more simple than [[Wizardry IV: The Return of Werdna|''Return of Werdna'']] and improved over the first three scenarios". He also noted, however, that the game played slowly due to extensive disk access.<ref name = "CGW">{{Cite magazine | issue = 56 | date = Feb 1989  | last = Owens | first = Dennis | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title =Descent Into The Maelstrom  | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1989&pub=2&id=56 | pages = 36–37 }}</ref> The magazine's [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] in 1991 and 1993 wrote that the game was "better than some, not as good as others".<ref name="scorpia199110">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 | title=C*R*P*G*S / Computer Role-Playing Game Survey | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1991 | issue=87 | access-date=18 November 2013 | author=Scorpia | pages=16}}</ref><ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | issue=111 | access-date=25 March 2016 | author=Scorpia | pages=34–50}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' said that the game was good for both those new to and familiar with the series, but criticized the IBM PC version's use of [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] instead of [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] or [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] graphics.<ref name="latimer198907">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-07-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_110_1989_Jul#page/n71/mode/2up | title=Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom | magazine=Compute! | date=July 1989 | access-date=11 November 2013 | last=Latimer | first=Joey | pages=70 | volume=11 | issue=7 #110 }}</ref>

Reviewing the SNES version, ''[[GamePro]]'' opined that though the non-hostile monsters, riddles, and puzzles are admirable improvements from previous ''Wizardry'' games, the gameplay of ''Wizardry V'' is still outdated compared to other SNES RPGs such as ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', noting in particular the need to repeatedly re-enter the same dungeon and the lack of multiple save slots.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom review|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=59|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1994|page=123}}</ref>
