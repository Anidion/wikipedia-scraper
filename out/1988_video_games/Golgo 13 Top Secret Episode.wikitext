In this game, based on a popular [[manga]], the player takes on the role of [[Golgo 13]] (also known as Duke Togo), an assassin whose objective is to destroy the leader of the Drek group. The story begins when a helicopter transporting a vial of a deadly bacillus known as "Cassandra G" is destroyed near the [[Statue of Liberty]], but the vial is nowhere to be found in the wreckage. Golgo 13 is blamed for the destruction and possible theft as a bullet of an M-16 was discovered in the wreckage, which he is known for being partial to. However, those in FIXER refuse to place blame on Golgo 13, and task him with hunting down the real assassin. On the way, Golgo 13 must pass through several areas, including [[East Berlin]], [[Athens]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], and [[Alexander Island]], which is located off the coast of [[Antarctica]].
