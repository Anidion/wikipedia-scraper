'''''Grand Prix Circuit''''' is a [[racing video game]] developed by [[Distinctive Software]] and published by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] for [[MS-DOS]] compatible operating systems in 1988. It was ported to the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Apple IIGS]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

== Gameplay ==

Players can choose from three different cars in the game. They are:

#[[McLaren MP4/4]] ([[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] 1.5L [[V6 engine|V6]] [[turbo]] - {{Convert|790|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}})
#[[Williams FW12C]] ([[Renault F1|Renault]] 3.5L [[V10 engine|V10]] - {{Convert|735|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}})
#[[Ferrari F1/87|Ferrari F1/87/88C]] (Ferrari 3.5L [[V12 engine|V12]] - {{Convert|680|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}})

The [[McLaren]]-Honda [[turbo]] is the most powerful car in the game but is also the most difficult car to control. This is the {{f1|1988}} combination that won 15 out of 16 Grands Prix (along with 15 pole positions) in the hands of [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Alain Prost]].

The [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]-Renault is the next most powerful and the car is relatively neutral to control. It is the {{f1|1989}} combination. The FW12C was driven by [[Thierry Boutsen]] and [[Riccardo Patrese]] in 1989.

The [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] is actually the {{f1|1988}} turbo car's chassis with the V12 engine. This version did appear in public in 1988, but only as the test mule for Ferrari's 1989 engine and was never raced. As the slowest of the three the Ferrari is also the easiest to control. The test car was driven by the team's 1988 drivers [[Michele Alboreto]] and [[Gerhard Berger]], as well as Ferrari test driver [[Roberto Moreno]].

There are five difficulty levels and three playing modes: practice, single event and championship circuit and the game is accompanied by music written for the Commodore 64 by Kris Hatlelid. The high score/end of game music is based on "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye" from 1969 by Paul Leka, Gary DeCarlo and Dale Frashuer.

==Reception==
A ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' review had mixed feelings about the game, noting the controls, which governed steering, acceleration, and shifting all at the same time, took so long to get used to that the reviewer ended up asking a friend to do shifting for him. The review did note the game was quite good after getting used to the controls.<ref name="CGW"/>

By 1991, the game had sold 100,000 units.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/89676520/edmonton-journal/|title=Investment in home computer helped turn teen into a tycoon|newspaper=[[Edmonton Journal]]|page=10|date=June 24, 1991|accessdate=November 28, 2021|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]]'' in 2010, [[Kazunori Yamauchi]], the creator of the ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'' racing franchise for the PlayStation, named ''Grand Prix Circuit'' one of his favorite racing games.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pattni |first=Vijay |date=2010-11-25 |title=Gran Turismo 5 is out now!
