In the April 1989 edition of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', Johnny Wilson gave an "unhesitating recommendation" of the game "to anyone who enjoys hockey".<ref name="wilson198904">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_58.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510170101/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_58.pdf |title=The Great One Digitized | magazine=Computer Gaming World |archivedate=May 10, 2013| date=April 1989 | author=Wilson, Johnny L. | pages=38|issue=58}}</ref>

In the January 1990 edition  of ''[[Games International]]'' (Issue 12), Mike Siggins found the arcade version of the game uninspiring, and the strategy game only a bit better. He concluded by giving the game 3 out of 5 for game play and 4 out of 5 for graphics, saying, "It is among the best hockey games around but sadly, given the earlier efforts in this field, that is not saying much [...] It is neither a good arcade game or stats based game, while it attempts to do both."<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine|last=Siggins|first=Mike| date=January 1990 |title=TComputer Games|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=12|pages=46–47}}</ref>
