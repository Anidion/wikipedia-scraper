'''''Xenon''''' is a 1988 vertical [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] video game, the first developed by [[The Bitmap Brothers]], and published by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]] which was then owned by [[Mastertronic]]. It was featured as a play-by-phone game on the Saturday-morning kids' show ''[[Get Fresh]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bitmap-brothers.co.uk/our-games/past/xenon.htm |title=Xenon |publisher=The Bitmap Brothers |access-date=2009-08-19}}</ref>

''Xenon'' was followed in 1989 by ''[[Xenon 2: Megablast]]''.

==Description==
[[image:Xenon in-game screenshot (Atari ST).png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot (Atari ST)]]
According to the game's instruction manual,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lemon |first1=Kim |title=Xenon - Manual |url=http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=1835 |website=Lemon Amiga |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> the player assumes the role of Darrian, a future space pilot in the Federation, currently at war with a mysterious and violent alien species called the ''Xenites'' that has lasted a decade. In response to a mayday transmission from Captain Xod following an attack on his trading fleet, Darrian is forced to travel through Xenite-occupied territory in order to support.

Unlike most vertically scrolling shooters, the player craft has two modes, a flying plane and a ground tank. The transition between crafts can be initiated at almost any time during play (except during the mid- and end-of-level boss sections, as well as certain levels where a certain mode is forced), and the mode chosen depends on the nature of the threat the player faces.<ref name="CVG">{{cite news |last1=Lacey |first1=Eugene |title=Xenon |url=https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-077/CVG_077_Mar_1988#page/n17/mode/2up |access-date=19 June 2018 |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |issue=77 |publisher=EMAP |date=March 1988}}</ref> Destroying some enemies released [[power-up]]s the player could catch to enhance their ship.

Writing in ''[[New Computer Express]]'' about the 1991 budget re-release, [[Stuart_Campbell_(game_journalist)|Stuart Campbell]] stated that although the graphics were "gorgeous" and had "never really been seen before", the gameplay was "simply tedious" and the game was the first to "turn 'style-over-content' into an artform".<ref name='newcomputerexpress310891'>{{cite magazine |title=Here It Comes Again|magazine=New Computer Express|issue=|publisher=Future Publishing|date=31 August 1991|page=51|url=https://archive.org/details/NH2021_New_Computer_Express_Issue147.pdf/page/n49/mode/2up|author=[[Stuart_Campbell_(game_journalist)|Stuart Campbell]]|access-date=24 November 2021}}</ref>
