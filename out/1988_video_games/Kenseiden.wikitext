{{nihongo|'''''Kenseiden'''''|剣聖伝||"Sword Saint Legend" or "Legend of the Swordmaster", also translated as "Summoning of the Sacred Sword"}} is a [[side-scrolling]] [[action role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Master System]]. It was released in 1988.

''Kenseiden'' stars Hayato, a samurai that has to fight against [[warlock]]s and evil spirits that plague 16th century Japan. The warlocks stole the five secret scrolls and the sword of the Dragon Lord. Hayato, who has dragon blood in his veins, must recover the scrolls and sword, enter the castle and kill [[Oda Nobunaga]].

The game was released as ''Hwarang-ui Geom'' (화랑의 검, "Sword of the [[Hwarang|Flower Knight]]") in South Korea and has the main character sprite altered to look like a Korean warrior and the Japanese map changed to a map of Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/kenseiden/kenseiden.htm|title=Kenseiden (剣聖伝) - Sega Master System (1988)|author=Kalata, Kurt|date=December 31, 2010|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In the original Japanese version, Hayato is blond.

Upon release, ''[[The Games Machine]]'' gave the game an 86% score, considering it one of the best "hack-'n-slay" games due to its "simple but highly playable action and superb presentation."<ref name=tgm/> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave it an 85% score, describing it as a "huge" role-playing adventure with exploration, "truly superb" still screens and "plenty of brain-bending puzzles" to last "weeks on end!"<ref name=cvg/>

Retrospectively, Levi Buchanan of [[IGN]] reviewed Kenseiden. He gave the game a 7.0 and said "even though I found the choice to go grim interesting and the visuals engaging, I have discovered my appreciation for Kenseiden was more of a 'love the one your [sic] with' sentiment. Master System junkies should still seek it out and give it a go, but there are indeed better games for the console that deserve your renewed attention."<ref name="IGN2"/>
