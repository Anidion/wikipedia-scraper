{{nihongo|'''''The NewZealand Story'''''|ニュージーランドストーリー|Nyū Jīrando Sutōrī}} is a [[platform game]] developed and released in [[arcade video game|arcades]] by [[Taito]] in 1988. The concept and setting were inspired by a holiday trip in [[New Zealand]] by one of the Taito programmers. The player controls {{nihongo|Tiki|ティキ}}, a [[Kiwi (bird)|kiwi]] who must save his girlfriend {{nihongo|Phee Phee|ピューピュー}} and several of his other kiwi chick friends who have been kidnapped by a large blue [[leopard seal]]. While avoiding enemies, the player has to navigate a scrolling maze-like level, at the end of which they release one of Tiki's kiwi chick friends trapped in a cage.<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/new-zealand-story The New Zealand Story for Amiga (1989) - MobyGames]</ref> In 2007, the arcade game received a remake for the [[Nintendo DS]] under the title ''New Zealand Story Revolution''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:tnzs screenshot.png|thumb|left|upright|Screenshot from an early level]]

The goal of each level is to safely get Tiki through the level, avoiding enemies, fire, and spikes (Tiki dies in one hit), and rescue one of his kiwi friends at the end. The weaponry starts out as an endless supply of arrows, but pickups can change these into bombs, lasers or bouncing fireballs. These act a little differently, and what is useful depends upon the player's location. A distinctive feature of this game is the ability to ride a variety of flying vehicles, including balloons, blimps and UFOs. Vehicles can be found ready for use or can be stolen from an enemy.

The levels Tiki has to explore are quite expansive. Instead of single screen levels, they scroll along with the player and extend in all directions, encouraging the player to explore and navigate to find the exit and the many secrets hidden about the maze. On the lower left corner of the screen, there is a mini-map which shows Tiki's position and the location of his caged kiwi friend, which is also the exit of each stage. Often, the vast size of the stages requires that Tiki get some means of transportation, often from enemies, to explore the stage and reach the exit. Though Tiki dies by enemies' weapons and projectiles, he is not harmed by them directly.

The game features four main zones, each with four rounds, the fourth round featuring a boss fight at the end. Other features include the many secret areas and shortcuts hidden throughout the game, accessed using special hidden "warp" portals. On certain later levels, if the player loses their last life due to being killed by a projectile weapon, they will be sent up to a special "Heaven" round. Here, they can either receive a special ending or find the secret route out of Heaven and continue playing the game.

Each stage has an invisible time limit in which the player should take to reach the exit. If the player takes too long to find it, a jingle will play, accompanied by a "Hurry Up!" message. If enough time passes after the warning, an invincible little red devil will appear onscreen to chase down Tiki and kill him instantly if it catches up to him.

The game shares several elements with previous Taito games (such as collecting letters to spell out "EXTEND", from ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'').

After the release of the original arcade game in 1988, the game was converted to most of the game consoles and home computers of the time. Most home releases came in 1989, with some arriving later through 1990–1992. The home computer versions were published by [[Ocean Software]], and their home computer versions refer to Wally as a walrus on the packaging, but the original arcade version specifically mentions him as being a [[leopard seal]] during the [[closing credits]]. The [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version was developed by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]] and published in the [[PAL region]]s by Ocean. In North America the NES version was published by Taito as '''''Kiwi Kraze'''''. The game was included in the [[Amiga 500]] [[Batman (1989 video game)|Batman]] Pack, which was launched in September 1989 and sold over 2 million units.<ref name="amigahistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.amigahistory.plus.com/a500batman.html |title=Amiga History Guide &#124; A500 Batman Pack |publisher=amigahistory.co.uk |accessdate=2015-09-04 |archive-date=2020-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327045916/http://www.amigahistory.plus.com/a500batman.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Home conversions generally received good reviews in video game magazines.<ref name="gamespy">{{cite web |url=http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/newzeala.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504181303/http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/newzeala.htm |archive-date=2006-05-04 |url-status=dead |title=Amiga Reviews: New Zealand Story &#124; "Amiga Format #1, August 1989" |accessdate=2015-09-04}}</ref><ref name="ysrnry">{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/newzealandstory.htm|title=The New Zealand Story &#124; Your Sinclair #45, September 1989|publisher=ysrnry.co.uk|accessdate=2015-09-04|archive-date=2015-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119220552/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/newzealandstory.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> The game was also converted for the Japanese [[FM Towns]] and [[X68000]] systems, providing arcade-perfect conversions, but released exclusively in Japan since both computers were only available there.

The [[Mega Drive]] version (again, only released in Japan) had its levels based on the prototype version of the arcade game.

The ''[[Taito Legends]]'' pack includes an emulated version of the original arcade version of ''The NewZealand Story'', allowing it to be played on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and any [[Personal computer|PC]]. On October 14, 2008, the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC-Engine]] version was released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan.

Tiki the Kiwi also made some cameo appearances in other Taito games such as ''[[Liquid Kids]]'', ''[[Bubble Symphony]]'' and (along with his lover Phee Phee) ''[[Pop'n Pop]]''.

The arcade version was released on the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] in January 2023 as part of Hamster's [[Arcade Archives]] series.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.superpixel.com/article/358037/arcade-classic-newzealand-story-arrives-ps4-nintendo-switch | title=Arcade Classic the NewZealand Story Arrives on PS4 and Nintendo Switch -- Superpixel}}</ref>

The Nintendo DS remake ''Revolution'' received average critical reception. ''[[IGN]]'' awarded ''Revolution'' a "mediocre" score of 5.9, and ''[[Eurogamer]]'' gave 6/10. While reviews highlighted the challenging and fun retro gameplay, they criticized the touch-stylus and spot-the-difference events as poorly implemented, and the level design sometimes seen as spiteful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ds.ign.com/articles/760/760830p2.html|title=New Zealand Story Revolution UK Review|author=Burman, Rob|accessdate=2009-05-31|quote=With a little more thought about level design and a more thorough graphics overhaul, Revolution could have easily stood its ground alongside ''New Super Mario Bros''.

==Legacy==
On January 25, 2007, [[Rising Star Games]] published the [[Taito]]-developed [[Nintendo DS]] remake titled '''''New Zealand Story Revolution''''' in Australia and in Europe on February 2. In North America, it was published by [[Ignition Entertainment]] on February 13. The game was published in Japan by CyberFront as {{nihongo|'''''New Zealand Story DS'''''|ニュージーランドストーリーDS}} on May 31 of the same year. This version combines the use of both screens for action on the top screen and a map on the bottom screen. During certain instances, the game utilizes the touchscreen, such as opening a door, finding a secret button or flicking Tiki to safety. It also introduces a four-player wireless mode, Normal and Expert game modes, and improved graphics and [[Background music|BGM]] over the original arcade version. Also, unlike in the original, Tiki can receive multiple hits before losing a life, and can shoot at an angle.
