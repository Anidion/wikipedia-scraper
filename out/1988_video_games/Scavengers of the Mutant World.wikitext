==Reception==
[[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Interstel may have attempted the impossible in trying to create a CRPG with replayability. Unfortunately, it was a rather limited goal for the game and the lack of a definite plotline works against it. In effect, the players end up with a diversion rather than an absorbing adventure. The good idea ends up being torpedoed by everything that comes before."<ref name="CGW59">{{cite magazine |author=Scorpia |authorlink=Scorpia (journalist) |title=Scavengers of the Mutant World |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=May 1989 |volume=1 |issue=59 |pages=40â€“41}}</ref>

Bruce E. Wiley for ''Quest Busters'' said "Most of my negative feelings weren't the program's fault, but due to my disappointment with the game's failure to deliver on the packaging's promises. ''Scavengers'' is a nice, simple RPG that beginners will find enjoyable and interesting."<ref>https://mocagh.org/questbusters/qbustersVI6.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>
