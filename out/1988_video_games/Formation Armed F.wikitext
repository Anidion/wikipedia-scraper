Taking place in the future of the space pioneering era, a mysterious point in the galaxy known as Point X1Y7Z94 is accidentally discovered, suddenly opens up and engulfs the stations nearby. All radio transmissions are silenced by the unknown, but violent forces on the other side as the point shows the energy capable of opening a black hole. The Milky Way Federation sends the latest developed star fighter in their fleet, the Vowger RC30, to Point X1Y7Z94 to investigate the area and eliminate the forces responsible for the events.
