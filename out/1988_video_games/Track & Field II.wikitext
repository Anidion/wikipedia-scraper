The series boasted 15 sporting events, with two of them available as bonus stages between rounds of the "Olympic" mode.

* '''Training''' is a basic training of the events to test out the abilities of the player in each event.
* '''Olympic''' is the story mode of the game where the player represents his or her country and competes with the world's best.
* '''Versus''' is where two players compete head-to-head in the sporting events.

* [[Fencing]]
* [[Triple jump]]
* [[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|Freestyle Swimming]]
* [[Diving (sport)|High Dive]]
* [[Skeet shooting|Clay Pigeon Shooting]]
* [[Hammer throw]]
