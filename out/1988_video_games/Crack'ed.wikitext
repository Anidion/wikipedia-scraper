'''''Crack'ed''''', subtitled "An Egg-Citing Adventure," is a target shooting video game developed by Robert Craig (credited as Robert Neve)<ref name="giantlist"/> for the [[Atari ST]] and released by [[Atari Corporation]] in 1988. An [[Atari 7800]] port was published the same year. In ''Crack'ed'' the player must protect bird eggs by shooting predators.<ref name="atariage"/>

An [[Atari 2600]] version was in development, but never released.<ref name="atariage"/><ref name="protos" />

==Gameplay==
The goal of ''Crack'ed'' is to protect the eggs in five nests during an attack by egg-stealing creatures. The controls are similar to that of light-gun games, except the ST mouse is used to position the crosshairs and the left mouse button shoots.<ref name="manual"/> On the 7800, the joystick is used instead of the mouse.

If a creature carries off an egg, the creature can be shot so it drops its prize. The falling egg can be caught with the crosshairs and placed back in a nest.<ref name="manual"/> If at the end of the raid at least one egg remains in a nest, then the level ends.<ref name="manual"/> There are five differently themed levels.<ref name="manual"/>

==Development==
In a 2003 interview, Robert Craig stated he was against the release of console ports, as ''Crack'ed'' was designed as a "mouse game."<ref name="martens"/>

==Reception==
In the August 1988 issue of ''ST Action'' magazine, the Atari ST version of ''Crack'ed'' received a 58% rating.<ref name="st_action"/>

===Retrospective===
Atari 7800 Forever scored a 2 out of 5, criticizing the stiff controls but praising the original idea for the game. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Funkmaster V |title=REVIEW: Crack'ed |website=Atari 7800 Forever |url=http://www.atari7800forever.com/crackedr.html}}</ref>

After playing the unreleased Atari 2600 prototype, a writer for AtariProtos commented, "While it may have been a mediocre title for the 7800, ''Crack'ed'' actually made a decent 2600 game."<ref name="protos" />
