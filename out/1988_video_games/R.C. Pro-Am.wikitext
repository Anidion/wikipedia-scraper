'''''R.C. Pro-Am''''' is a [[racing video game]] developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was released in North America in February 1988, and then in Europe on April 15. Presented in an overhead [[isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric perspective]], a single player races a [[radio-controlled car]] around a series of tracks in [[vehicular combat game|vehicular combat]]. Each track qualifies its top three racers for the next track. Collectible [[power-up]] items improve performance, hazards include rain puddles and oil slicks, and missiles and bombs can temporarily disable opponents. Originally titled ''Pro Am Racing'', it was [[porting|ported]] to the [[Sega Genesis]] in 1992 as ''Championship Pro-Am'', an [[enhanced remake]] with enhanced graphics and additional features. ''R.C. Pro-Am'' spawned two sequels: ''[[Super R.C. Pro-Am]]'' in 1991, and ''[[R.C. Pro-Am II]]'' in 1992.

As one of Rare's first successful NES games, ''R.C. Pro-Am'' was well-received for its visuals, sound, gameplay, and enjoyability. Its overhead perspective distinguishes it from earlier first-person racing games. It inspired subsequent games such as ''[[Super Off Road]]'', ''[[Rock n' Roll Racing]]'', and the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series. It has appeared in many "top games of all time" lists and is regarded as one of the best of the NES library. It was re-released in Rare's 2015 ''[[Rare Replay]]'' compilation for the [[Xbox One]], and on the [[Nintendo Switch Online]] service on February 21, 2024.

==Gameplay==
''R.C. Pro-Am'' is a [[racing video game]] in which a player races a [[radio-controlled car]] against three opponents around a track from an overhead  [[isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric perspective]].<ref name="FunClub5">{{cite magazine|date=February–March 1988|title=''R.C.

Across 32 tracks, the top three of four racers qualify for each next race or reach a [[game over]]. Two [[continue (video games)|continue]]s can restart the previous race, losing all points. Each track gives a trophy, and a high score yields larger "High Score Trophies", leading up to the "Super Trophy".<ref name="R.C.

Twelve unique track configurations are repeated indefinitely.

The game has no formal end; players eventually run out of weapons and are eliminated from the race.

<!--Items and hazards-->
Track items are collectable by driving over them.

Excessive use of projectile weaponry makes the yellow car accelerate to 127&nbsp;mph, which cannot be matched by the player.<ref name="FunClub5" />

The [[Sega Genesis]] version, ''Championship Pro-Am'', features some gameplay differences from the NES version. Players race against five other vehicles instead of three, but must still place in the top three to move to the next track. Race records are saved, and players are prompted to enter a name before the game start.<ref name="GENinstman">{{cite manual | type=booklet | title=Championship Pro-Am Instruction Manual |publisher=[[Tradewest]] |location=[[Corsicana, TX]] |year=1992}}</ref>

The game development company Ultimate Play the Game was founded by brothers [[Tim and Chris Stamper]], along with Tim's wife, Carol, from their headquarters in [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] in 1982.

<!--Contemporary reviews-->
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called it "a compelling, innovating approach to car racing video games". Bill Kunkel found that it was distinguished from earlier racing games such as [[Sega]]'s ''[[Enduro Racer]]'', [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Mach Rider]]'', and [[Atari]]'s ''[[Pole Position]]'' by going from a more standard "pseudo-first-person" view to an isometric perspective. He praised its simplicity and controls, comparing them to that of an actual radio-controlled car. He criticized its lack of a two-player feature and for the instruction booklet's vagueness. He concluded by lauding its graphics and sound, saying that they "help make this the best game of its kind ever produced in any electronic game format".<ref name="CGW">{{cite magazine|last=Kunkel|first=Bill|date=December 1988|title=Video Gaming World: Start Your Engines|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_54|location=[[Anaheim, CA]]|publisher=Golden Empire Publications|issue=54|page=[https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_54/page/n64 65]|issn=0744-6667|oclc=150247674|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]}}</ref> ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' listed ''R.C.

<!--Retrospective reviews-->
The game has continued to receive positive reviews. [[Allgame]]'s Chris Couper stated that ''R.C. Pro-Am'' is among the best NES games, due to its realistic nature. He praised its challenge and sound.<ref name="Allgame" /> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' saw the game as a precursor to ''[[Micro Machines (video game)|Micro Machines]]'' by [[Codemasters]], and compared the action and variety of items to the later ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series.
