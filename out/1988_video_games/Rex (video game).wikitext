'''''Rex''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]] similar to ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/rex/| title = Rex | first = Konstantinos | last = Dimopoulos | date = August 7, 2008 | accessdate = July 18, 2016 | publisher = [[Retro Gamer]] | quote = "In Rex, a very Metroid-esque platform-shooter sort of a game, players ... set off to rid his (their?) home-planet from a huge polluting factory-tower-fortress thing. Actually, make that a huge, cavernous, impressively non-linear factory-tower-fortress thing and you'll have managed a way more accurate description." }}</ref> that was published by [[Martech]] in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]].

==Gameplay==

The player controls Rex, a "[[Anthropomorphism|rino-sapien]]" [[mercenary]], hired to eliminate the humans that have built a Great Tower in a place called Zenith.<ref>''Rex'' game instructions</ref> Action takes place in a flip-screen cavern complex. Rex can jump, shoot and activate a shield to block incoming attacks. Enemies include fixed gun turrets and human soldiers; shooting the latter initiates a 'multi recoil system' in which the defeated soldier's body continues to recoil until the player's bullets stop hitting it. Destroyed enemies leave behind Energy Bubbles, which can be used to upgrade Rex's weapon.

==Development==
''Rex'' was developed by a programming team consisting of Neil Harris, Richard Allen and John Anderson. After working for [[IBM]], they all left to form The Light, choosing the [[Z80]] as their development platform. Neil and John were coders, whilst Richard worked on graphics.<ref>''Sinclair User'' issue 81; Code Talk article on The Light</ref> ''Rex'' was the only game they developed.<ref name='sc_thelight'>{{cite web |title=The Light|website=spectrumcomputing.co.uk|publisher=SpectrumComputing|date=|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/list?label_id=14453|access-date=3 October 2022}}</ref>


In issue 112 of ''[[Retro Gamer Magazine]]'', coder Jas Austin revealed that Creative Reality, authors of several titles for [[Martech Games]], were the actual creators of Rex. They devised the pseudonym The Light because their previous game had been a commercial failure. John Anderson was Jas Austin, Neil Harris was Neil Dodwell and Richard Allen, Dave Dew. This was Creative Reality's last 8-bit game, but they continued into the 90's with PC games such as [[Martian Gothic]] and [[Dreamweb]].
