'''''Fusion''''' is a scrolling [[multidirectional shooter]] developed by [[Bullfrog Productions]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1988 for the [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]].

==Gameplay==
It is a scrolling [[multidirectional shooter]] with [[parallax scrolling]]. The action is viewed from the top. The player controls either a ground-based crawler or a spacecraft. There are thirteen levels.

==Development==
''Fusion'' was created by [[Bullfrog Productions]], a development studio founded by game designer [[Peter Molyneux]]. It was the company's first original product and second game overall, after a [[Porting|port]] of the shoot 'em up ''[[Druid II: Enlightenment]]''.<ref name=thieves /><ref name=direction /> As with ''Druid II'' and the later ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'', artist Glenn Corpes created most of the graphics and animation for ''Fusion'', while Molyneux handled the majority of its programming and design. The game was coded in [[assembly language]], and the [[Atari ST]] version was developed using [[HiSoft Systems]]' Devpac II assembler. Its soundtrack, available on the [[double-sided disk]] release, was composed by David Hanlon.<ref name=direction>{{Citation | last = Outterside | first = Nic | title = Artistic direction | newspaper = [[Atari ST User]]  | pages = 50, 51 | volume=4 | issue=2 | date = April 1989 }}</ref> ''Fusion'' was released in 1988.<ref name=thieves />

Matt Fox, author of ''The Video Games Guide'', summarized ''Fusion'' as a "run-of-the-mill shoot 'em up [that] caused few ripples on release".<ref name="VGG" /> According to Corpes, ''Fusion'' was not a commercial success and, together with ''Druid II'', "only brought in a fraction of the money needed to pay the wage bill."<ref name=thieves>{{cite book |title=Grand Thieves & Tomb Raiders: How British Video Games Conquered the World |last1=Levene |first1=Rebecca |last2=Anderson |first2=Magnus |publisher=[[Aurum Press]] |date=2012-11-08 |isbn=978-1-78131-107-3}}</ref>

A UK magazine gave the ST version of ''Fusion'' a score of 9 out of 10, saying that despite being "yet another vertically scrolling shoot-'em-up" it has "sufficient variation".<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Waddilove | first1 = Roland | last2 = Murray | first2 = Janice | title = Action-packed shoot-out | newspaper = [[Atari ST User]]  | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages = 26 | date = April 1989 }}</ref> Bullfrog went on to develop ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'', ''[[Magic Carpet (video game)|Magic Carpet]]'' and other well-received titles.<ref name="VGG">{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Matt|title=The Video Games Guide: 1,000+ Arcade, Console and Computer Games, 1962-2012|edition=2nd|series=6|year=2013|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, NC|page=116|isbn=978-0786472574}}</ref>
