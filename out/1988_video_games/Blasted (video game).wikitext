'''''Blasted''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade video game]] released by [[Bally Midway]] in 1988.

== Gameplay ==
Players use the high-powered scope-[[rifle]] to shoot [[cyborg]]s who have invaded an apartment complex, but be careful not to shoot the tenants or get hit by return fire. In 2-player mode, you shoot at your opponent's building and he shoots at yours.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blasted - Videogame by Bally Midway |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7144 |access-date=2022-06-29 |website=www.arcade-museum.com}}</ref>

== Development ==
Originally, this game was a 4 player shooter known as ''International Team Laser'', an attempt to capitalize on the [[laser tag]] craze of the late 1980s. However, the game was canned, and its gameplay elements were re-themed to create ''Blasted'', which included reducing the number of players from 4 to 2.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}
