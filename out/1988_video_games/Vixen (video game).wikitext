'''''Vixen''''' is a [[platform game]] published by [[Martech]] in 1988 for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

==Plot==
Vixen is the last human on the planet Granath, which is now ruled by a race of dinosaurs. Abandoned as a child and raised by magical foxes, she intends to follow through on a promise she made to her elders to wipe the dinosaurs out and restore the planet to humanity.

==Gameplay==
Vixen was based unofficially on the [[Tecmo]] arcade game ''[[Rygar]]''.<ref name=retrogamer133>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|title=Martech Games - The Personality People|page=51|issue=133|author=Graeme Mason}}</ref> Each level must be completed within a time limit, by progressing from left to right. The player's character is armed only with a whip, used to defeat enemies and to collect bonus items such as gems (for points), extra lives and time. The player's character can also collect fox head tokens. If enough are collected by the end of the level, she will transform into a fox, allowing the player to enter a special underground lair. Here she can collect gems, mega gems (which increase scoring potential above ground) and weapon upgrades (to increase the power of her whip). A notable feature in the game was that it used an early form of [[motion capture]] to generate the animation for the main character<ref name=retrogamer133 /> making it far more realistic than usual for a computer game of that era.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mason|first=Graeme|date=2016-05-15|title=Nine ways the the[sic] 8-bit era made gaming what it is today|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-15-nine-ways-the-the-8-bit-era-made-gaming-what-it-is-today|access-date=2021-01-29|website=Eurogamer|language=en}}</ref>

==Reception==
The various versions of ''Vixen'' received a wide range of review scores. ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]''<ref name="archive1">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-11/ACE_Issue_11_1988_Aug#page/n67/mode/1up |title=ACE Magazine Issue 11 |date=August 1988 |access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref> gave it a score of 452/1000 saying it had "nothing original to offer". ''[[Computer & Video Games]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-081/CVG_081_Jul_1988#page/n51/mode/2up/search/vixen |title=CVG Magazine Issue 081 |date=July 1988 |access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref> praised the graphics, particularly on the Atari ST, but criticised the playability.  ''[[The Games Machine]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/thegamesmachine-magazine-11/TheGamesMachine_11#page/n48/mode/1up |title=The Games Machine Magazine Issue 11 |access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/thegamesmachine-magazine-08/TheGamesMachine_08#page/n77/mode/1up |title=The Games Machine Magazine Issue 08 |access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref> rated the game from 42% for the "barely adequate" Amstrad version to 72% for the PC version. ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' awarded the game 6/10<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Vixen|magazine=Your Sinclair |issue=32 |publisher=Dennis Publishing |date=August 1988|page=70|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=253&page=70}}</ref> stating that while the animation of the main character was superb, "the rest of the graphics suck".

The cover of the game, featuring [[Page Three girl]] [[Corinne Russell]] in the guise of the Vixen, caused controversy and high-street chain [[Boots Group|Boots]] refused to stock the game until [[Martech]] reissued the game with a less provocative cover.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Censor Nonsense|magazine=Crash |issue=55 |publisher=Newsfield Publishing |date=August 1988|page=92|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=1022&page=92}}</ref> The May 1988 issue of ''Your Sinclair'' featured a similar image on the front page<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/your-sinclair-29|title=Your Sinclair: issue 29|date=May 1988|access-date=2023-08-12}}</ref> which was equally controversial and attracted a number of complaints.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-31/YourSinclair_31_Jul_1988#page/n15/mode/2up |title=Dark Side : Your Sinclair Magazine : Issue 31|date=July 1988 |access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref>
