'''''Powerdrome''''' is a 1988 futuristic [[racing video game]] by Michael Powell released on the [[Atari ST]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. Players race jet-engined, anti-gravity bikes called ''blades'' around closed tracks. Ports for [[Amiga]] and [[MS-DOS]] were released in 1989 and 1990 respectively. A remake was released in 2004.

==Gameplay==
The game includes six tracks, set across five planets. The road-equivalent turning method of [[Flight dynamics|yaw]] is not present, meaning a right turn is achieved by rolling to the right and pitching up.<ref>Timothy Trimble;Apr 1990;''Powerdrome Review'' in ''Amiga World'' Vol 6 No 4;pp72] "To make a right turn, roll to the right, then pull back on the yoke, which swings the nose of your racer into the turn."</ref> Control is very sensitive but allows use of the mouse for greater accuracy.<ref>Mark Higham;(Dec 1988);''Powerdrome'' in ''ST Amiga Format 6'' (Dec 1988);pp 52-53 "This spectacular looking frying pan is about as easy to control as a Lamborghini in the wintry frozen fields of Dartmoor."</ref> Gameplay is complicated by the need to equip gas filters to cope with each planet's atmosphere and weather, with further choices to be made over types of fuel.

Control was improved for the [[Amiga]] release in 1989 and an extra track made available. A version on the [[Personal computer|PC]] in 1990 was soon followed by a re-release on all formats.

== Reception ==
Released as a budget game, ''Powerdrome'' received good reviews, with a few remembering the original and its influence on the futuristic racing genre.<ref>[http://www.ntsc-uk.com/review.php?platform=xbo&game=Powerdrome NTSC-UK] "the game became an instant cult classic, paving the way for the slew of sci-fi racers that we know today."{{Dead link|date=December 2020}}</ref><ref>[http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox/driving/powerdrome/review.html GameSpot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014180158/http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox/driving/powerdrome/review.html |date=2007-10-14 }} "When speaking of the genesis of futuristic racing games as we know them ... UK developer Argonaut lays some claim to genre husbandry"</ref> All were impressed with the smooth sensation of speed and detailed environments, although the music was considered lackluster and the pilots' voices annoying.

==Remake==
[[Image:Power Drome.jpg|thumb|right|Cover art for the remake]]

A remake known as ''Powerdrome'' (or ''Power Drome'') was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in June 2004. A [[Microsoft Windows]] version was released in August 2005 only in Europe. It was developed by [[Argonaut Sheffield]], for whom Powell was studio head. [[ZeniMax Media#Defunct|Mud Duck Productions]] published the game in North America, Evolved Games in Europe and the PC version was published by [[Zoo Digital Publishing]]. Venues for racing still only number six, but reverse and mirrored courses bring the total of unique routes to 24. The previous version's customisation was completely dropped in favour of a focus on racing skill.<ref>[http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox/765/Powerdrome/p1 Team Xbox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612233553/http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox/765/Powerdrome/p1/ |date=2008-06-12 }} "The biggest drawback ... is the complete lack of customizing in the game."</ref>
