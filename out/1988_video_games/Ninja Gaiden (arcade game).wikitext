==Plot==
Set in a [[retro-futuristic]] version of 1999, the player controls a ninja hired by the United States government<ref>{{cite web |title=Retro Game Museum |url=http://arcadefan.web.fc2.com/Ryukenden.html |access-date=23 March 2022}}</ref> to defeat an evil cult led by Bladedamus, a descendant of [[Nostradamus]] who seeks to fulfill his [[Eschatology|end of the world]] prophecies. Flooding the streets of the United States with criminals released from [[Alcatraz]], Bladedamus has kidnapped the President and acquired codes for launching the nation's ICBMs.<ref name=gamestno29>{{cite journal|journal=Gamest|script-title=ja:紹介 - 忍者龍剣伝|author=Joe Yamada|language=ja|page=103|volume=29|date=February 1989|url=http://www.geocities.jp/arcadon765/Ryukenden.html|access-date=2010-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704144734/http://www.geocities.jp/arcadon765/Ryukenden.html|archive-date=2012-07-04|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=famimaga198901>{{cite magazine|magazine=Family Computer Magazine|script-title=ja:ぼくたちゲーセン野郎|language=ja|author=Satoshi Tajiri|author-link=Satoshi Tajiri|url=https://twitter.com/chou_nosuke/status/606052702246666241|date=1989-01-06|pages=114–115|accessdate=2015-11-27}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Ninja Gaiden (arcade) gameplay.png|left|thumb|The game's first stage, with the advertising sign having been damaged]]

The first player controls a ninja dressed in blue, while the second player controls one dressed in orange. Like most beat-'em-ups, players proceed through stages by defeating enemies scattered through each area.

The controls consist of an eight-way joystick with a button installed on top and two additional action buttons for attacking and jumping. The button on top of the joystick allows the player character to grab onto any overhead bar or tightrope and hang from there. There are five primary techniques performed by pressing the joystick and buttons individually or in combination with each other. These consists of the {{nihongo|"Triple Blow Combination"|3段連続攻撃|Sandai Renzoku Kōgeki|a series of punches and kicks that serve as the player's standard attack}}, the {{nihongo|"Flying Neck Throw"|首切り投げ|Kubikiri Nage|performed by attacking the enemy while jumping}}, the {{nihongo|"Hang Kick"|反動蹴り|Handō Keri|performed by attacking the enemy while hanging from a bar}}, the {{nihongo|"Tightrope Walk"|綱渡り術|Tsunawatari Jutsu|in which the player moves while hanging from or standing above a tightrope}}, and the {{nihongo|"Phoenix Backflip"|飛鳥返し|Hichō Gaeshi|a backflip performed after running into a wall}}, which becomes an attack if the player has a sword.

The player can destroy certain objects in the environment (such as telephone booths, signposts, dumpsters) by knocking or throwing enemies onto them. These will uncover hidden items that will award the player with bonus points, health recovery, time extensions and even an extra life. One particular item will temporarily arm the player with a sword that can be used up to ten times before reverting to his standard punches and kicks.

The first five stages are based on actual American cities and landmarks such as [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[North Carolina]], the [[Grand Canyon]], and a [[transcontinental railroad]]. The sixth and final stage is set inside the enemy's hideout. The recurring bosses include a [[sumo wrestler]], a pair of wrestlers resembling the [[tag team]] [[The Road Warriors]] known as the {{nihongo|Daor Warriors|ドーロウォリアーズ}}, and a trio of claw-wielding masked acrobats known as the {{nihongo|Men from Nanto|南斗の男たち|Nanto no Otokotachi}}. The final boss, Bladedamus, wields two swords and has a fire breath attack.<ref name=famitsu1989no5>{{cite journal|journal=ファミコン通信|title=ビデヲゲーム通信62|issue=69 (1989, No.5)|date=March 3, 1989|language=Japanese|url=https://archive.org/details/bi-weekly-famitsu-no.-69-march-3rd-1989/Bi-Weekly%20Famitsu%20-%20No.%2069%20March%203rd%2C%201989%20%28Compressed%29/page/n117/mode/2up}}</ref>

The ''Ninja Gaiden'' arcade game was produced and released almost simultaneously with its [[Ninja Gaiden (NES video game)|home console counterpart]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], although they are different games with only a few similarities.<ref name=masatokato>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ninjagaiden/ninjagaiden12.htm|title=Ninja Gaiden at Hardcore Gaming 101 - Interview with Masato "RUNMAL" Kato|author=Hardcore Gaming 101 editorial staff|quote=Kato: Both (the arcade and NES versions of Ninja Gaiden) were developed side by side on the same floor, at the same time.

Home versions of ''Ninja Gaiden'' were released under the ''Shadow Warriors'' title in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]] by [[Ocean Software]] for five different computer platforms ([[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[Amstrad CPC]]). The game was published for the [[IBM PC]] by [[Hi-Tech Expressions]], and a single-player game for the [[Atari Lynx]] had to be programmed from scratch which was done by [[BlueSky Software]]. The arcade version of ''Ninja Gaiden'' is also included as a hidden bonus game in ''[[Ninja Gaiden Black]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in [[2005 in video gaming|2005]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://xbox.gamedaily.com/game/news/?gameid=531&id=5418 | title = Ninja Gaiden Extras Confirmed...Again | author = Brightman, James | publisher = GameDaily | date = February 10, 2004 | accessdate = 2006-08-23}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The arcade game was a major commercial success in North America, becoming the highest-grossing arcade [[1989 in video games|conversion kit of 1989]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Special Report: 1989's Best Videos and Pins |magazine=RePlay |date=January 1990 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=44, 46 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-14-issue-no.-4-january-1990-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2014%2C%20Issue%20No.%204%20-%20January%201990/page/44}}</ref> In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Ninja Gaiden'' on their March 15, 1989 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=352|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 March 1989|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>

The arcade game was well received by critics. Nick Kelly of ''[[Commodore User]]'' called it "the next generation for ''[[Double Dragon]]'' fans" with praise for the controls, background variety and two-player mode, but with some criticism towards the "slightly washed-out" graphics and "gory" continue screen.<ref name="CU">{{cite magazine |last1=Kelly |first1=Nick |title=Arcades: Shadow Warriors |magazine=[[Commodore User]] |date=19 December 1988 |issue=64 (January 1989) |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=United Kingdom |page=103 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/275/306}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called it a "slick beat 'em up" similar to ''[[Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja]]'' (1988) with "smooth" graphics and "masses of action" that is "great fun" in two-player mode, despite the lack of originality.<ref name="CVG_ARC">{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action: Shadow Warrior |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=January 1989 |issue=88 (February 1989) |pages=102–3 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/196/306}}</ref>

Reviewing the Atari Lynx version, Robert A. Jung with ''[[IGN]]'' said the story was irrelevant and the game was a scaled down version of the arcade original. He praised the graphics but in his final verdict he wrote that "''Ninja Gaiden'' is not a bad game; it's just not a good game, either."<ref name=ignreview_lynx>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/07/07/ninja-gaiden |title=The second Tecmo arcade conversion for the Atari Lynx is somewhat disappointing. |work=IGN |author=Robert A. Jung |date=6 July 1999 |access-date=18 August 2018}}</ref>
Rob Swan with ''Computer and Video Games'' said the game was exactly the same as the arcade coin-op and felt the game was a little short of superb but really addictive.<ref name=cvg_lynx>{{cite magazine |title=Lynx Lowdown |magazine=Computer Videogame Magazine |author=Rob Swan|date=August 1991 |issue=117 |page=37}}</ref>
Les Ellis gave the game a positive review in ''Raze''.<ref name=raze_lynx>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/RAZE_Issue_10_1991-08_Newsfield_Publishing_GB#page/n53 |via=archive.org |title=Ninja Gaiden |magazine=Raze |author=Les Ellis |issue=10 |page=54 |date=August 1991 |access-date=18 August 2018 }}</ref>

Reviewing the Atari ST version, [[ST Review]] writes, "One of the better arcade conversions, this is a game that has stood the test of time."<ref name="STRev">{{cite web| url=https://mega.nz/file/hFcgAIQY#uZcXtTyf0TjhiB-BHxTPJDX-4feMRp7SdUdzVsNGt9w|title=SHADOW WARRIORS (Issue 2, June 1992 page 88)|website=ST Review}}</ref>

Reviewing the ZX Spectrum version, ''Your Sinclair'' praised the colorful graphics and interactive backgrounds. ''Crash'' liked the animation, but had grown tired of the genre. ''Sinclair User'' summed it up with "there isn't really a speck of originality about Shadow Warriors. Nonetheless, it will be a stiff challenge." Reviewing the Amiga and Spectrum versions, ''C+VG'' highlighted the music and sound effects.
