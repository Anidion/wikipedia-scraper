'''''Where Time Stood Still''''' is an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] [[action-adventure game]] released by [[Ocean Software|Ocean]] in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]] for the [[ZX Spectrum|Sinclair Spectrum]] 128K, [[MS-DOS]] and [[Atari ST]]. The game was ported by fans to [[Amiga]] in July 2014, and on [[Amiga CD32]] in December 2014 and was converted from the [[Atari ST]] version with some enhancements which were not present in other iterations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.retrocollect.com/News/oceans-where-time-stood-still-unofficially-ported-to-commodore-amiga.html|title=Ocean's 'Where Time Stood Still' Unofficially Ported To Commodore Amiga|author=Cauterize|date=2014-08-01|work=RetroCollect|access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> A Commodore 64 version was considered but never started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/where-time-stood-still/|title = Where Time Stood Still (C64) - 1988 Ocean - GTW64| year=1988 }}</ref> The game was produced by [[Denton Designs]] as a follow-up to ''[[The Great Escape (1986 video game)|The Great Escape]]'' from 1986.

== Plot ==
A plane has crashed in a remote and unknown plateau of the [[Himalayas]]. To their horror, the survivors soon discover that it is populated by dangerous [[prehistoric]] creatures and tribes.

The player must guide the party of four survivors - the pilot, Jarret, and his three passengers - to safety, avoiding [[dinosaurs]], [[Human cannibalism|cannibals]] and natural dangers, while also ensuring they are sufficiently rested and fed during the long and difficult journey.

== Description ==
The graphics are rendered in [[Isometric projection|isometric]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] projection. The [[Atari ST]] and [[ZX Spectrum|Spectrum]] versions are [[monochrome]] while the [[MS-DOS|DOS]] version uses four-color [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]]. The DOS version has no music, with sounds limited to [[PC speaker]] beeps and clicks.

The [[Amiga]] and [[Amiga CD32]] versions for the most part are a 1:1 rendition of the [[Atari ST]] version, but do have some enhancements such as full introduction sequence, based on the comic book style adverts that were available and enhanced music that utilise the [[Amiga]] better.  The [[Amiga CD32]] version is the same as the [[Amiga]] version except it uses [[AmigaDOS]] for preloading all files and then running the entire game from RAM.

== Gameplay ==
The player initially controls Jarret, the leader of the party. The other survivors are Clive, a wealthy businessman; Gloria, his daughter; and Dirk, her fianc√©. Each member of the party may be controlled by the player or by the game. Each member of the party has a different personality and abilities. For example, Clive is overweight, tires easily, and is always hungry. Dirk is athletic and has some knowledge of the local languages; he is reluctant to leave Gloria, and will become despondent if she dies. Useful objects are scattered about the map, which should be carefully explored.

A simple menu and cursor system is used to select members and manipulate objects. Computer-controlled characters will complain if they are injured, tired or hungry. It is up to the player to decide what action to take in response. Indulge them too often, and food and time will run short. Ignore them, and they will abandon you and try to make their own way to safety.
