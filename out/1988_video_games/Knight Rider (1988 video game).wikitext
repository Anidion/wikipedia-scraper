'''''Knight Rider''''' (ナイトライダー ''Naito Raidā'') is a [[Video game genres#Racing|racing]] video game<ref>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Every TV Version of Knight Rider, Ever |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-brief-history-of-every-tv-version-of-knight-rider-ev-1788201869 |website=Gizmodo |date=October 25, 2016 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] that is very loosely based on the television show [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|of the same name]].

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is simple: There are fifteen cities that are featured, starting with a drive from [[Los Angeles]] to [[San Francisco]] and ending back in Los Angeles. KITT can be upgraded with more fuel and shield capacities. It can also have its top speed upgraded, and how many lasers/missiles it starts with. In the first six missions, there are allies, represented by Knight trucks who will give a powerup to the player.

===Mission mode===
[[Terrorist]]s have raided a [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] site; only a [[Michael Knight (Knight Rider)|man]] and his robotic [[KITT|car]] can chase them across the [[United States]] to stop their evil plan. A time limit helps put pressure on the player as he attempts to defeat the terrorist forces. There are three types of vehicles in this mode: Red (enemies), blue (civilians) and yellow (enemies who carry powerups). KITT has structural shielding; however the vehicle is considered destroyed if it repeatedly crashes or enemy gunfire depletes the shielding.<ref name="mobygames">{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/knight-rider_| title = Basic gameplay information | publisher = [[MobyGames]]| date = | accessdate = October 19, 2008}}</ref> Despite the [[nonviolence|non-violent]] premise of the television show, "Mission Mode" makes use of [[firearm]]s as way to enhance play, similar to ''[[RoadBlasters]]''. Shooting non-combatant (blue) vehicles deducts from the timer, making the completion of a level more difficult. After every third level, Devon will offer the player a password that can be used to resume the journey from that point.

===Drive mode===
There is also a ''drive'' mode that allows players to go on a simple drive through the game's stages without weapons or enemy fire.

==Music==
The game pointedly does not include the iconic theme from the ''Knight Rider'' television show.<ref>{{cite web |title=THE FANTASTIC CAR RETRO 'Knight Rider', we analyzed the adaptation for NES of the unforgettable series ' |url=https://www.zonared.com/analisis/retro-knight-rider-nes/ |website=Zonared |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>
