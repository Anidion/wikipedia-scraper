'''''Alien Crush''''' is a [[pinball]] [[video game]] developed by [[Compile (publisher)|Compile]] for the [[PC Engine]]/[[TurboGrafx-16]]. It was released in 1988.  The game is the first installment in the ''[[Crush Pinball]]'' series. It was followed by three sequels, ''[[Devil's Crush]]'', ''[[Jaki Crush]]'', and ''[[Alien Crush Returns]]''. ''Alien Crush'' was later rereleased on the [[Virtual Console]] and on the [[PlayStation Network]].

''Alien Crush'' garnered generally favorable reception from critics, some of which reviewed it as an [[Parallel importing in video games|import title]]; praise was given to the unusual and original graphical design reminiscent of the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' films, realistic physics, accessibility towards less experience players and playability but some felt divided regarding its audio, while the transition between the two screens and lack of variety in gameplay aside from the bonus rounds were seen as negative points. Retrospective commentary has been mostly positive.

== Gameplay ==
{{Expand section|date=April 2022}}
''Alien Crush'' features a science fiction theme reminiscent of the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. Essentially, the player is "fighting" against the aliens with their [[pinball]] skills.

The playfield of ''Alien Crush'' consists of two main screens arranged vertically, with a pair of flippers at the bottom of each. The play stops momentarily as the ball shifts from one screen to the next. There are also several hidden/bonus rooms. These hidden rooms mainly involve destroying all the aliens (or several waves of aliens) for bonus points.  Should the player achieve the maximum possible score of 10 less than 1 billion, the game ends with the destruction of the table and a congratulatory message.<ref>{{cite video game|title=''Alien Crush'' |developer=Compile|date=September 14, 1988|platform= PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16|level=Ending|quote="Congratulations!!  You are the greatest player"}}</ref>

The player is given the choice of a fast or slow ball speed and two different music tracks.

==Sequels==
''Alien Crush'' was the first game in the ''Crush Pinball'' series developed by [[Compile (company)|Compile]] and distributed by [[Kaga Create|Naxat Soft]] and later [[Hudson Soft]]. A common theme amongst all installments in the series that sets them apart from other pinball games is the presence of [[sci-fi]], [[fantasy]] or [[occult]] themes.

''[[Devil's Crush]]'' was released in 1990 also for the TurboGrafx-16, which featured an occult theme with skulls, skeletons, and demons. ''Devil's Crush'' was ported to the [[Sega Genesis]], retitled ''Dragon's Fury'' (''Devil Crash MD'' in Japan), by developer [[Technosoft]]. A third game was later developed for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] called ''[[Jaki Crush]]'' that contained a Japanese demon/ogre mythology theme, although the game was never released outside Japan.

The series was revived in 2008 when Hudson Soft published a [[sequel]]/[[remake]] to ''Alien Crush'' called ''[[Alien Crush Returns]]'' for [[WiiWare]].

While ''Jaki Crush'' became largely obscure, ''Alien Crush'' and ''Devil's Crush'' were well received and have both been re-released on the [[Virtual Console]].

''[[Demon's Tilt]]'' was released in 2019. The game has been called a [[spiritual successor]] to the ''Crush Pinball'' series, namely ''[[Devil's Crush]]''.<ref name="NLPreview">{{cite web |last1=McFerran |first1=Damien |title=Devil's Crush Spiritual Successor Demon's Tilt Is Coming To Switch |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/12/devils_crush_spiritual_successor_demons_tilt_is_coming_to_switch |website=Nintendo Life |publisher=Gamer Network |access-date=11 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217003138/https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/12/devils_crush_spiritual_successor_demons_tilt_is_coming_to_switch |archive-date=17 December 2019 |date=11 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
