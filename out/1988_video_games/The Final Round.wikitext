'''''The Final Round''''', released in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Hard Puncher'''''|ハードパンチャー - 血まみれの栄光 -|Hādopanchā: Chimamire no Eikō|lit. "Hard Puncher: Bloodsoaked Glory"|lead=yes}}, is a [[boxing]] [[arcade game]] released by [[Konami]] in 1988.<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/arcade/567823-the-final-round/data ''The Final Round'' at gamefaqs.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7802 ''The Final Round'' at arcade-museum.com]</ref><ref>[http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=3272&image=1 Arcade Flyer (front)]</ref>

A player selects one of two different boxers, and they fight another boxer in a three-round bout. If the player wins, he moves on to the next opponent, climbing the KBA (Konami Boxing Association) rankings along the way. If he loses, he can insert another coin for another chance (rematch). Fights can be won by either [[knockout]], [[technical knockout]] or the judges' decision.

== Gameplay ==
When a one-player game is started, one of two different boxers can be selected by pressing the one or two player button. The player then allocates 100 points between three different skills (Speed, Power, and Stamina). A high "Speed" level makes a boxer move and punch faster. A high "Power" level makes a boxer cause more damage when punching, and a high "Stamina" level makes a boxer endure more damage and recover more energy after being knocked down.

When a two-player game is started, both boxers allocate their points and fight against each other. The winner stays, while the loser may get a rematch by inserting another coin. During a normal game, a second player can buy-in and challenge at any time (except during "training sessions").

The player uses the [[joystick]] to move around the ring, as well as three buttons: face punch, body punch, and block punch. During a bout, the block punch button protects the player's fighter from enemy attacks and switches the character's guard between face and body each time it's pressed. The two punch buttons may be used alternately to pull out combinations or a special, more powerful "Super Punch".<ref>[http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=3272&image=2 Arcade Flyer (back)]</ref>

If the player is knocked down, they must shake the joystick and press the buttons repeatedly to refill a bar and get back to their feet. Failing to do so will result in a Knockout loss. If any fighter is knocked down three times in a round, a TKO (Technical Knockout) will occur. These are highlighted with a special animation of the defeated boxer crumbling to the canvas. If all three rounds are fought, the judges decide the winner by decision. Each opponent has his own, unique fighting style with strengths and weaknesses.

[[Image:The Final Round Training.jpg|thumb|right|Speed training session]]

Every two bouts, players are given the choice of entering a "training session" to earn more skill points or skip these sessions entirely. The "Speed" session consists of punching green dummies appearing from eight different positions. The "Power" session consists of punching small volleyballs tossed from both left and right, high and low. The "Stamina" session consists of jumping a spinning rod of increasing speed.

When the player defeats the World Champion, a special winning animation will play with a congratulatory message. The credits roll, and the game ends. The total fight time and final score are displayed on screen. Depending on the player's total time at the end of the game, the winning animation and message change, effectively serving as [[multiple endings]].<ref>{{youTube|id=yYrz4N76FGc|title=''Hard Puncher'' Playthrough (part 1)}}</ref><ref>{{youTube|id=D0fSKE2tHQI|title=''Hard Puncher'' Playthrough (part 2)}}</ref>

== Regional differences ==
The Japanese version of the game (known internally as Version H) is notably different from its overseas counterparts (Versions L and M) in several ways: the player's energy does not constantly drain by merely walking around the ring. The two main characters and some of the enemy boxers have been given alternate names. Most of the voice samples have been changed from English to Japanese, and the presence of a few [[Easter Egg (media)|Easter Eggs]] not included in the American release.

These include a flock of birds appearing in the ring at the start of a fight (damage based), an alternate head ([[Moai]]) for the referee (time based), a bonus hidden in the "Power" training session, and two different circuits (game modes) made accessible via joystick input at the beginning of a new game.

== Soundtrack ==
The game's [[Soundtrack album|Soundtrack]] was produced by [[Konami Kukeiha Club]] and published by [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] on July 21, 1989 as part of "Konami Game Music Collection Vol.0" along additional soundtracks from ''Flak Attack (MX 5000''), [[The Main Event (arcade game)|''The Main Event'']], ''Gang Busters'', ''[[City Bomber]]'', and ''Devastators''.<ref>[http://www.game-ost.com/albums/2566/konami_game_music_collection_vol.0 Konami Game Music Collection Vol.0]</ref>
