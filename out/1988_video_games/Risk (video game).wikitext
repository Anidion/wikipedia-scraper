'''''Risk''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] based on the board game of the [[Risk (game)|same name]].

==Gameplay==
The player can select as many as five computer opponents. The player can play either the British or American version of the game, including the extra armies cards.<ref name="Dragon156"/>

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that while the computer version offered the convenience of an automated opponent for solitary players, the board game would likely be more fun for most because they would not have to crowd around the computer, which could not easily display the entire world at once.<ref name="wilson198910">{{cite news | title=Risky Business | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1989 | author=Wilson, David M. | pages=55}}</ref>

The game was reviewed in 1990 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #156 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon156">{{cite journal
