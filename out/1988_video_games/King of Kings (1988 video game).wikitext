==Summary==
This video game features 22 different types of playable units (categorized into [[people]], [[fairy|fairies]], [[dragon]]s and other kinds of units). Human units tend to have a weak overall defense, fairy units are often the least expensive to produce, all dragons except the lizardmen are very expensive to build, and the other units combine the strengths and weaknesses of the other three kinds of units. There is a campaign mode where the player does battle against a computer team led by [[Lucifer]] across four maps.<ref name="gamesummary">{{cite web | url = http://page.freett.com/twg/castle/tower/kok.htm | title = Basic game summary for ''King of Kings'' | language = Japanese | publisher = Freett | date =  | accessdate = 2012-04-24 | archive-date = 2016-01-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160131052652/http://page.freett.com/twg/castle/tower/kok.htm | url-status = dead }}</ref> There is a multiplayer mode where up to four teams can battle on eight additional maps.<ref name="gamesummary"/> A bonus map based on Japan's greatest [[swordsmith]] [[Masamune]] is present as an [[easter egg]] in this video game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www25.atwiki.jp/famicomall/pages/338.html | title = Secret map information |language=Japanese | publisher = FC no Game Seiha Shimasho | date = | accessdate = 2012-04-24}}</ref>

===Game system ===
The players [[Monarch|king]]'s unit is the axis of the game while the opponent's king can easily defeat the player's chance for victory. Players must do operations such as occupation and city funding. Kings can produce other units to conduct aggressive behavior. They are several types of units including [[warrior|fighter]]s and [[goblin]]s. Each unit's attack and defensive powers are different. In multiplayer mode, the unnamed "alliance" exists among allies battle but an allied victory is not achievable. Only defeating the opposing king(s) will result in a victory for the player.<ref name="gamesummary"/> If the player is playing against more than one human opponent, it is possible for teams to enjoy the game alliance system.

===Production system ===
Players create production systems by putting a King unit inside the castle to summon other units. The production unit is a system that consumes funds and also creates a certain amount of revenue each time a player's turn comes up. Players can increase revenue by occupying the town and castle. The King unit can move to the castle immediately after producing a unit. He can also advance to the attack; he is considered to be outside the castle and is unable to produce.

===Unit ===
The possible fighter units in the game are goblins, [[elf|elves]] and dragons. These characters are central to fantasy games and appear in the game. Each unit has set level; which is increased by killing enemy units. Levels range from 1 to 9 (with the ninth level character wearing a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]). It is very important to have a higher attack rating than the opponent. On the other hand, having a higher defense rating also helps to win battles and to create a balanced game system. Some units can use "[[Magic (gaming)|magic]]" that turns directly attack enemy units with various special effects. The campaign mode is limited to the type of units than can be produced. These types start off as being less productive. However, more types of units will be added in the second half of the game.

===Movement system===
All units have a predetermined moving pattern. Respectively, units can only advance within its movement range that is allowed by the game. Movement is also consumed by [[topography]]; plains and roads need less power while high mountains and forests consume more. [[Food]] is consumed in order to regain movement points. All units consume food in order to keep moving. After running out of food, only a city or a [[monk]] can restore the unit's supply of food.  Therefore, players need to consider maintaining the supply line during the [[invasion]].
