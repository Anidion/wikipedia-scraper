'''''Snatcher'''''{{efn|{{nihongo||スナッチャー|Sunacchā}} in Japanese}} is a [[cyberpunk]] [[graphic adventure game]] developed and published by [[Konami]]. It was written and designed by [[Hideo Kojima]] and first released in 1988 for the [[PC-8801]] and [[MSX|MSX2]] in Japan. ''Snatcher'' is set in a future East Asian metropolis where [[humanoid robot]]s dubbed "Snatchers" have been discovered killing humans and replacing them in society. The game follows Gillian Seed, an [[amnesia]]c who joins an anti-Snatcher agency in search of his past. Gameplay takes place primarily through a menu-based interface through which the player can choose to examine items, search rooms, speak to characters, explore a semi-[[open world]], and perform other actions.

Kojima wanted ''Snatcher'' to have a cinematic feel, so the setting and story are heavily influenced by [[science fiction films]], like ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'', and ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''. Development on the PC versions took more than twice as long as the average game of the time, even after Kojima was asked to trim more than half his initial story. The game was released to positive reviews, but poor sales. It garnered a [[cult following]], and was [[Video game remake|remade]] as a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] called ''SD Snatcher'' for the MSX2 in 1990. This was followed by a remake of the original adventure game using [[CD-ROM]] technology, released for the [[TurboGrafx-16#Super CD-ROM²|PC Engine Super CD-ROM² System]] in 1992.

Looking to provide a more interactive experience to gamers in the West, Konami developed a [[Sega CD]] version of ''Snatcher'' specifically for North America and Europe in 1994. Although it was a commercial failure, the Sega CD version received mostly positive reviews for its cinematic presentation and mature themes uncommon in games at the time. ''Snatcher'' has been retrospectively acclaimed as both one of the best adventure and cyberpunk games of all time, and identified as a foundation for the themes Kojima explored later in the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series. The game was a significant inspiration on [[Goichi Suda]], who worked with Kojima to produce a [[radio drama]] prequel, ''Sdatcher''. ''Snatcher'' was last rereleased in 1996 on the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]]. The game was also included in the [[TurboGrafx-16 Mini|PC Engine Mini]] in 2020, though only playable in Japanese. Its lack of availability on modern platforms has surprised industry analysts, given the game's legacy.

==Plot==
[[File:SnatcherCast.png|thumb|right|The main cast of ''Snatcher''. From left to right: Jean-Jack Gibson, Harry Benson, Random Hajile, Gillian Seed, Jamie Seed, Katrina Gibson, Benson Cunningham, and Mika Slayton.]]
''Snatcher'' is set in the mid-21st century, fifty years after a [[Biological agent|biological weapon]] known as Lucifer-Alpha killed much of the world's population. In Neo Kobe City, a metropolis on an artificial island in eastern Asia, humanoid robots dubbed "Snatchers" have been recently discovered killing humans, donning their skin as a disguise, and replacing them in society. The Neo Kobe government quarantines the city from the outside world and establishes JUNKER,{{Efn|In Japanese versions, JUNKER is an abbreviation for "Judgement Uninfected Naked Kind & Execute Ranger"; in the English release, it stands for "Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Rangers".}} a task force to hunt Snatchers. The player takes on the role of Gillian Seed ([[Yusaku Yara]]/Jeff Lupetin), an [[amnesia]]c who can only remember that his past, along with that of his estranged wife Jamie ([[Kikuko Inoue]]/Susan Mele), is somehow related to Snatchers. He starts working at JUNKER in hopes that hunting Snatchers will bring his past to light.

=== Act 1: Snatch ===
After arriving at the JUNKER headquarters, Gillian Seed meets Mika Slayton ([[Miina Tominaga]]/Kimberly Harne) and Chief Benson Cunningham ([[Gorō Naya]]/Ray Van Steen), and receives a robot navigator named "[[Metal Gear (mecha)#Metal Gear Mk. II (Snatcher)|Metal Gear Mk. II]]" ([[Mami Koyama]]/Lucy Childs) from JUNKER's engineer Harry Benson ([[Ryūji Saikachi]]/Ray Van Steen). Metal Gear receives a distress call from Jean-Jack Gibson (Isao Inoguchi/Jim Parks), the only other JUNKER agent, so Gillian travels there with Metal Gear, only to find a pair of Snatchers have killed him. They try to pursue the Snatchers, but are forced to make a quick escape as the factory explodes. Gillian begins searching for the identity of the Snatchers that murdered Jean-Jack, and after searching his house with the help of his daughter Katrina (Miina Tominaga/Lynn Foosaner) and speaking with his informant "Napoleon" (Gorō Naya/Jim Parks), Gillian identifies a pair of suspects. When hunting down the Snatchers, he is nearly killed but is saved by Random Hajile ([[Kaneto Shiozawa]]/Jim Parks), a Snatcher bounty hunter. 

=== Act 2: Cure ===
Random joins Gillian and Metal Gear as they travel to a hospital Jean-Jack identified as suspicious during his investigation. They learn it has been abandoned for several years and harbors a secret basement where they find skeletons of Snatcher victims. Among them, they find Chief Cunningham, meaning the JUNKER chief is a Snatcher. Some Snatchers attack the group, but Random distracts them to allow Gillian and Metal Gear to escape. Back at JUNKER headquarters, Gillian speaks to Harry briefly before he dies, having been mortally wounded by the Chief, and kills the Chief after Mika is taken hostage.{{efn|The original versions of the game (PC-8801 and MSX2) end at this point. The following events are only depicted in later versions of the game.<ref name="Kalata Snatcher"/>}} Immediately after this, Gillian receives a call from Jamie, telling him she has regained her memories and is being held in the "Kremlin".

=== Act 3: Junk ===
Gillian and Metal Gear travel to an abandoned church resembling [[Moscow Kremlin|the Kremlin]], where they find Jamie being held captive by a scientist named Elijah Modnar (Kaneto Shiozawa/Ray Van Steen), who explains Gillian's past. He, his father and Jamie were involved in a secret experiment undertaken by the [[Soviet Union]] over 50 years prior during the [[Cold War]] to create Snatchers, which were designed to kill and replace world leaders, giving the Soviets more power. Gillian was a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent spying on the project, who married Jamie and had a child with her, Harry Benson. Gillian and Jamie were placed in a [[Suspended animation|cryogenic sleep]] when Elijah released Lucifer-Alpha into the atmosphere. The pair were saved by the army, and lost their memories due to the extended period of time they had been frozen. Having become corrupt with power, Elijah reveals that he intends for the Snatchers to wipe out and replace humanity as proof of mankind's follies; he also reveals that Random was an anti-Snatcher created by his late father based on Elijah's appearance and memories, and presents his deactivated body. At this point, Random reactivates and holds Elijah at bay, allowing Gillian and Jamie to escape. Metal Gear activates an [[orbital weapon]], which destroys the Snatcher base, killing Elijah and Random. Having learned of a larger Snatcher factory in [[Moscow]], Gillian prepares to embark on a mission there, hoping to destroy the menace and rekindle his marriage with Jamie.

Originally ''Snatcher'' was going to be a [[PC-8801]] exclusive, but it was also developed for the [[MSX|MSX2]] at the request of Konami.<ref name="Weekly ASCII JP">{{Cite web|url=http://weekly.ascii.jp/elem/000/000/214/214490/|title=スナッチャーの敵はメタルギア!? コナミのMSXゲーム伝説5：MSX30周年|date=April 17, 2014|website=週刊アスキー|language=ja-JP|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007040340/http://weekly.ascii.jp/elem/000/000/214/214490/|archive-date=October 7, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=September 23, 2018}}</ref> The PC-8801 version supports [[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM]] and stereo sounds via the Sound Board II expansion card while the MSX2 version came with a special cartridge that provided an expanded soundscape beyond the platform's default capabilities and extra [[Random-access memory|RAM]], featuring different music track arrangements.<ref name="Weekly ASCII JP" /> The expansion cartridge raised the price of the MSX2 version beyond that of the PC-8801 version, a reverse from the platform's typically cheaper retail game pricing.<ref name="Weekly ASCII JP" /> The quantity of music and sound was greater than other games at the time, and required a larger than usual sound team.<ref>

=== PC Engine ===
[[File:Snatcher_censorship.png|thumb|right|''Snatcher'' features mature themes including gore and sex. Some scenes in the PC Engine version, such as the death of the Lisa Nielsen Snatcher (''top''), were censored when localized for the Sega CD version (''bottom'').|alt=Two screenshots are shown. The stop image shows a dead robot woman with her dress ripped exposing her breasts. The bottom image is the same scene but her dress is not ripped.]]
Players began asking for a home console version soon after release.<ref name="Nob Ogasawara Interviews" /> Because the game was large and required several floppy disks, only [[CD-ROM]] systems were considered as opposed to systems that ran [[ROM cartridge]]s. The [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] had the [[CD-ROM² System|Super CD-ROM² System]] available so it was chosen to host ''Snatcher''<nowiki/>'s console [[Video game porting|port]].<ref name="Nob Ogasawara Interviews" /> Fully titled ''Snatcher CD-ROMantic'', this port was the first time that Konami worked with CD technology.<ref name="Noir At Its Best" />

The team added a third act to this version, based on the extended story featured in the 1990 RPG adaptation ''[[#SD Snatcher|SD Snatcher]]'',<ref name=pcemanual>{{cite book|title=PCエンジン版スナッチャー 遊び方＆読み切り|url=https://dds.konami.com/games/manual/pcemini/jp_Snatcher.pdf|page=2|access-date=2021-03-06}}</ref> a decision they were criticized internally for as others believed the game was already long enough.<ref name="Nob Ogasawara Interviews" /> Using CD technology enabled them to add recorded speech and high quality background music.<ref name="Nob Ogasawara Interviews" /> Artist Satoshi Yoshioka created the graphics for this version. Kojima wanted the visuals to appear as "cinematic" as possible, so Yoshioka pulled inspiration from ''Blade Runner'', ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984), and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) to replicate their [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]-style special effects. He used a custom drawing application by Konami to create the character graphics, including the facial expressions during conversations. He found Gillian's expressions to be the most difficult to animate due to the complexities of his characterization.<ref name="Noir At Its Best" />

A [[game demo|trial version]] called the ''Pilot Disk'' was released on August 7, 1992. It covers the beginning of the first act and also contains supplemental content such as character introductions, a preview trailer, and select music tracks.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=August 1992|title=SNATCHER|url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/62/PCEngineFan_JP_1992-08.pdf|magazine=PC Engine Fan|language=ja|pages=81|access-date=October 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007073650/https://retrocdn.net/images/6/62/PCEngineFan_JP_1992-08.pdf|archive-date=October 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The full version was released on October 23, 1992<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=7440|title=スナッチャー [PCエンジン] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=September 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007075212/https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=7440|archive-date=October 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and reportedly sold well for a PC Engine game.<ref name="Nob Ogasawara Interviews" />

=== Sega CD ===
After releasing its first game on the [[Sega CD]], ''[[Lethal Enforcers]]'' (1992), Konami wanted to bring a more interactive experience to the system for Western players. It considered making a game in [[full motion video]] like ''[[Night Trap]]'' (1992) but thought it may be too difficult, and ultimately decided to localize and port ''Snatcher''. This also gave the ''Snatcher'' developers an opportunity to improve upon the PC Engine version which they were still not completely satisfied with.<ref name="Nob Ogasawara Interviews" /> Although the Sega CD could only display 64 colors simultaneously (compared to the PC Engine's 256), the team used software techniques to increase this to 112 and modified some of the palettes to compromise.<ref name="Nob Ogasawara Interviews" />

Several scenes were [[Video game censorship|censored]] or otherwise altered for the Sega CD release. The breasts of the deceased Lisa Nielsen Snatcher were covered up, while the sequence in which Katrina Gibson is shown standing naked in a shower was obscured, and Katrina's age was changed from 14 to 18.<ref name="Nob Ogasawara Interviews" /> Some options that allowed Gillian to engage in sexual behaviors were removed or toned down, such as those that allowed him to sniff panties or stare at breasts.<ref name="Blaustein Barker">{{Cite web|url=http://junkerhq.net/Jeremy.html|title=Interview with Jeremy Blaustein by Chris Barker|website=Junker HQ|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029155143/http://junkerhq.net/Jeremy.html|archive-date=October 29, 2007|url-status=live|access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref> Audio in which a robot becomes aroused while watching a pornographic film was cut out entirely.

Feeling that the third act was too movie-like, Konami added more interactivity through additional forks and choices.

The game was translated by Scott Hards, with supervision from [[Jeremy Blaustein]] and Konami of Japan.<ref name="Blaustein Barker" /> The translation took about two to three months.<ref name="Blaustein Barker" /> Seven voice actors recorded about two and a half hours of dialogue for 26 different characters.<ref name="Nob Ogasawara Interviews" /> With the large amount of text included in the game, the translation was expensive, and Konami felt it was the most difficult part of the porting process.<ref name="Nob Ogasawara Interviews" /> Kojima was not involved with the Sega CD port and the changes to the game's content and story were made without his input.<ref name="Blaustein Barker" /><ref name=snatcherkataru/> Two voice-acted scenes exclusive to this version include an extended prologue that adapts the manual comic from the previous versions, and an additional scene in the ending in which Mika and Katrina arrive to see Gillian off with Jamie before he departs to Moscow.{{Cn|date=April 2023}}

===PlayStation and Sega Saturn ===
''Snatcher'' was released once again in Japan in 1996, this time for 32-bit game consoles. A [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was released on January 26,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=16187|title=スナッチャー [PS] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=September 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007041739/https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=16187|archive-date=October 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> followed by a [[Sega Saturn]] version on March 29.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=229|title=スナッチャー [セガサターン] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=September 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007041743/https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=229|archive-date=October 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> As with the Sega CD version, Kojima had no direct involvement with these versions, with development being handled by [[Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo]]. The music and visuals were completely redone on both ports, with some music tracks being replaced entirely. The Saturn version, being released a bit later, has some additional graphical refinement in some drawings over the PlayStation version. Because the voice track is reused entirely from the PC Engine version with no newly-recorded material, these 32-bit versions lack the added scenes from the Sega CD version - instead the prologue comic is recreated as CGI animation on a pre-rendered video intro, and while Mika and Katrina still appears in the ending to see Gillian off with Jamie, the two characters are completely silent during the scene.{{Cn|date=April 2023}}

</ref> The game plays from a top-down perspective, where the player controls Gillian as he ventures through the environment. When the player encounters an enemy on the field, the game shifts to a first-person battle mode. The player must shoot down enemies using one of many different guns. Different parts of an enemy can be targeted and different weapons have varying abilities and ranges.<ref name="Kalata SD" /> Like the MSX2 version of ''Snatcher'', ''SD Snatcher'' consisted of three floppy disks with game data and a sound cartridge equipped the SCC chip.

''SD Snatcher'' was developed by Konami due to the company's desire to create an RPG in an unusual futuristic setting, choosing to adapt the story and setting of ''Snatcher'' for such a game. While the original versions of ''Snatcher'' released in 1988 ended the story in an inconclusive matter due to the cancellation of the planned sequel, ''SD Snatcher'' adds an additional segment that continues the story from where the prior version left off (this added portion served as the basis for the third act added in later console ports of the original ''Snatcher'').<ref name=msxfan199005>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=FAN ATTACK SDスナッチャー |url=https://archive.org/details/MSXFAN199005/page/n17/mode/2up |magazine=MSX FAN |location=Japan |publisher=Tokuma Shoten Intermedia |date=May 1990 |access-date=2021-03-04}}</ref> Initially Hideo Kojima was not involved with the development of ''SD Snatcher'', as he was busy with ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]'' at the time, but he and his team were brought in during the late stages of development to help complete ''SD Snatcher'' smoothly so they could resume development of ''Solid Snake''.<ref name=beepmd199305>{{cite magazine |author=Kojima, Hideo|title=今明かされるMSX秘語③ 我が青春のMSX|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3ABeepMD_JP_1993-05.pdf&page=83 |magazine=[[Gemaga|Beep!
