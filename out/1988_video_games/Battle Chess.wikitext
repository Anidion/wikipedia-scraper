'''''Battle Chess''''' is a [[video game]] version of [[chess]] with [[2.5D]] graphics and fighting animations showing the result of one piece moving onto the square of another. It was developed and released by [[Interplay Entertainment]] for the [[Amiga]] in 1988 and ported to many other systems, including the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]], [[Acorn Archimedes]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Amiga CDTV]], [[Apple IIGS]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], [[FM Towns]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[MacOS]], [[PC-98]], [[X68000]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. In 1991, '''''Battle Chess Enhanced''''' was released by Interplay for IBM PC compatibles and Macintosh with improved [[VGA]] graphics and a symphonic musical score played from the [[CD-ROM]].

''Battle Chess'' was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, resulting in two official follow-ups as well as several inspired games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], ''Battle Chess: Game of Kings'', was released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] on December 11, 2015.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ST Battle Chess.png|thumb|left|Atari ST screenshot]]

''Battle Chess'' follows the same rules as traditional chess, with [[chess piece|piece]]s moving in an animated fashion and battles playing out so that the capturing piece defeats its target. Furthermore, when [[checkmate]] is delivered, the checkmating piece fights and defeats the king. Since there are six types of pieces for each color, and a king cannot check (let alone capture) another king, there are a total of 35 different battle animations.<ref name = "CGW">{{Cite news | date = Feb 1989 | last = St. Andre | first = Ken | authorlink = Ken St. Andre | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title =Low Blows and Other Winning Moves | issue = 56 | page = 27}}</ref> The [[Rook (chess)|rook]], for example, turns into a [[Golem|rock monster]] and kills a pawn by smashing its head, and the rook kills the queen by eating her. There are some pop-culture homages; the knight versus knight animation references the [[black knight]] fight in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', and the king versus bishop fight pastiches the short battle between [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] and a swordsman in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.

The game can be also played in a 2D version with no animations, and the [[Amiga CDTV]] version has a fully voiced introduction describing the movements of the pieces for the benefit of beginners. Digitized sound is used in the MS-DOS version for all battle sound effects and is played through the [[PC speaker]], without the need for a sound card, using a technique akin to [[RealSound]].

''Battle Chess'' can be played against a human opponent (by [[hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]], [[null modem]] or over a [[local area network]] in some ports) or against the computer's [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).<ref name="CGW"/> The game has an [[Chess opening book (computers)|opening library]] of over 30,000 moves (which were not available for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Apple II]] versions). {{clear left}}

== Development ==
''Battle Chess'' was the first title developed and published by [[Interplay Entertainment]] themselves after ending their relationship with [[Electronic Arts]], besides ''[[Neuromancer (video game)|Neuromancer]]''.

''Battle Chess'' producer and Interplay's founder [[Brian Fargo]] expressed his fondness for the game in a 2006 interview, although he added that he did not think there would be much of an audience for it today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.firingsquad.com/news/newsarticle.asp?searchid=13641 |title=inXile Entertainment Update - News and Siteseeing<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210164815/http://firingsquad.com/news/newsarticle.asp?searchid=13641 |archive-date=2007-02-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>

An apocryphal story of the development was the invention of "The Duck" (an example of Parkinson's [[law of triviality]]): The producers of the game were known to demand changes to the game, presumably to make their mark on the finished product. To this end, one animator added a small duck around the queen piece, but made sure that the sprite would be easily removable. Come review, the producers, predictably, okayed everything but asked for the duck to be removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/|title=New Programming Jargon|work=codinghorror.com|date=20 July 2012|access-date=2014-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602072210/http://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/|archive-date=2015-06-02|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Battle Chess'' sold 250,000 copies by February 1993.<ref name=cgwsales>{{cite magazine| author=Staff |title=Letters from Paradise |date=February 1993 |issue=103| magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=154, 156}}</ref>

[[Ken St. Andre]] reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Quibbles aside, every chess player will want a copy of this program, and every Amiga owner owes it to him/herself to see Battlechess in action. Highly recommended."<ref name = "CGW"/>

The Amiga version received favourable reviews from magazines due to its comical battle sequences which were advanced (for the time) in terms of graphics, animation and sound. German game magazine ''ASM'', however, criticized the weak chess AI.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=584 |title=DIE Kult Seite über die alten Spiele-Magazine und Retro-Games! |publisher=Kultboy.com |accessdate=2012-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206104108/http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=584 |archive-date=2013-12-06 |url-status=live }}</ref> In a review of the 3DO version, Mike Weigand of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' stated, "If you are a chess fan, then you may want to check this title out."<ref name="EGM54">{{cite magazine|title=Review Crew: Battle Chess|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=54|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=January 1994|page=48}}</ref>

In 1994 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' said of the [[video game remake|remake]], ''Battle Chess Enhanced'', that "Better artwork, smoother animations, and a much stronger chess algorithm than its disk predecessors make the CD version a good buy".<ref name="cgw199404">{{Cite magazine

===Sequels===
A sequel titled ''[[Battle Chess II: Chinese Chess]]'' was released in 1991, based on [[xiangqi]], commonly known as "Chinese chess". 1992's ''[[Battle Chess 4000]]'' spoofed science fiction movies and television series (such as a battle sequence involving the monolith from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') and used a [[clay animation|clay-animation]] art style similar to ''[[ClayFighter (video game)|ClayFighter]]''.

On December 28, 2015, [[Brian Fargo]] revealed that he had started working on a second sequel of the game titled ''Battle Chess 3'' in the late 1990s but the game was cancelled. He also released a footage of the prototype of the game.<ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://www.pcgamer.com/brian-fargo-reveals-battle-chess-3-prototype-fight-video/|title= Brian Fargo reveals Battle Chess 3 prototype "fight" video|author= Andy Chalk|magazine= [[PC Gamer]]|date= December 28, 2015|accessdate= December 29, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160101115903/http://www.pcgamer.com/brian-fargo-reveals-battle-chess-3-prototype-fight-video/|archive-date= 2016-01-01|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamereactor.eu/news/371363/Brian+Fargo+reveals+Battle+Chess+3+prototype/|title= Brian Fargo reveals Battle Chess 3 prototype|author= Bengt Lemne|work= [[Gamereactor]]|date= December 29, 2015|accessdate= December 29, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160204135505/http://www.gamereactor.eu/news/371363/Brian+Fargo+reveals+Battle+Chess+3+prototype/|archive-date= 2016-02-04|url-status= live}}</ref>

===Inspired games===
''Battle Chess'' also inspired a number of [[video game clone]]s,{{r|cgw199404hof}} such as ''[[Star Wars Chess]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day – Chess Wars]]'',<ref name="kee199403">{{Cite magazine |last=Kee |first=Jay |date=March 1994 |title=Darth Vader vs. The Terminator |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=116 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=90–94 |access-date=2017-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110115305/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=116 |archive-date=2017-11-10 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Combat Chess]]'' and ''[[National Lampoon, Inc.#Other media|National Lampoon's Chess Maniac 5 Billion and 1]]''.

One similar game, titled ''[[Battle vs. Chess]]'', was developed by [[TopWare Interactive]] for "just about every platform".<ref>{{cite web |last=McElroy |first=Griffin |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/05/27/battle-vs-chess-coming-this-fall-to-just-about-every-platform/ |title=Battle vs. Chess coming this Fall to just about every platform |publisher=Joystiq |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2013-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616034228/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/05/27/battle-vs-chess-coming-this-fall-to-just-about-every-platform/ |archive-date=2013-06-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, Interplay filed and won an injunction for trademark infringement in 2010 and TopWare was prevented from releasing ''Battle vs. Chess'' in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2010/12/25/interplay-wins-injunction-against-topwares-battle-vs-chess-game/ |title=Interplay wins injunction against Topware's Battle vs Chess game |publisher=News.bigdownload.com |date=2010-12-25 |accessdate=2013-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307172757/http://news.bigdownload.com/2010/12/25/interplay-wins-injunction-against-topwares-battle-vs-chess-game/ |archive-date=2012-03-07 |url-status=live }}</ref>
The District Court of California came into session and given that after two years of litigation, TopWare Interactive discharged their lawyer, resulting in Interplay winning the case by default.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightsideofnews.com/news/2012/2/13/interplay-wins-over-topware-in-battle-vs-chess-affair.aspx |title=Interplay Wins over TopWare in "Battle vs. Chess" Affair - Bright Side Of News* |publisher=Brightsideofnews.com |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref> Topware afterwards released the game in [[North America]] with the name ''Check&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;Mate''.

===Remake===
In 2012 Subdued Software launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to fund an updated version of ''Battle Chess''.<ref>{{cite news |title='Battle Chess' looking to be reborn via Kickstarter |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/battle-chess-looking-be-reborn-kickstarter-flna758807 |access-date=8 May 2012 |work=NBC News |language=en}}</ref> Although the campaign was unsuccessful, the game was ultimately published by Interplay under the name ''Battle Chess: Game of Kings'' and released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/games/franchise/778-battle-chess|title=Game Franchises - Battle Chess - GameFAQs|website=gamefaqs.gamespot.com|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> On whatoplay.com it has a rating of 4.9/10.<ref>{{cite news |title=Battle Chess: Game of Kings for PC Game Reviews |url=https://whatoplay.com/pc/battle-chess-game-of-kings/ |work=Whatoplay |language=en}}</ref>
