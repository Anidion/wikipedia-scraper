'''''King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella''''' is a [[graphic adventure game]] developed and released by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]] for the [[MS-DOS]], [[Amiga]], [[Apple II]], [[Apple IIGS]], and [[Atari ST]] computers in 1988. The player takes on the role of [[Princess Rosella]], daughter of King Graham of Daventry (''[[King's Quest I]]'' and ''[[King's Quest II]]'') and the twin sister of Gwydion/Alexander (''[[King's Quest III]]''), who must save her father and a good fairy and destroy an evil witch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/vgmuseum_sierra_sierra-88catalog2/sierra-88catalog2#page/n3/mode/1up/ |title=MOCAGH.ORG: Sierra On-Line: sierra 88catalog2 |access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref> Critically acclaimed, it was one of the first PC games to support a [[sound card]].

== Gameplay ==
''King's Quest IV'' uses the [[Adventure Game Interpreter]] (AGI) and Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) systems. This is the only chapter in the ''[[King's Quest]]'' series where the action takes place in real-time and within the allotted time limit, as the events of the game cover about 24 hours. Some activities must be completed during the day, while other puzzles can be solved only at night (the nightfall in the game happens either at 9 pm or at a certain point in the plot<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/cheats/575/|title=King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella|date=2010-07-01|publisher=Adventure Classic Gaming|access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref>). The overall high difficulty of ''[[King's Quest III]]'' was toned down in ''King's Quest IV''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/150/|title=King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella - Review|website=www.adventureclassicgaming.com|access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref>

== Plot ==
Picking up immediately where ''[[King's Quest III|King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human]]'' left off, as King Graham tosses his children his [[Bycocket|adventure's cap]], he suffers a massive [[heart attack]] and is left on his death bed. The devastated Princess Rosella is contacted via the Magic Mirror by the good fairy Genesta in the faraway land of Tamir who reveals the existence of a magic fruit that can heal King Graham in exchange for Rosella helping Genesta. Rosella agrees and is teleported to the [[fairy]] kingdom of Tamir. The realm's ruler, Queen Genesta, reveals that her archenemy, the evil fairy Lolotte, has stolen her talisman without which Genesta will die in twenty-four hours. Additionally, without the talisman, Genesta lacks the power to return Rosella to Daventry. Rosella agrees to undertake a quest for both the talisman and the magic fruit and goes out undercover, dressed as a peasant girl.

Rosella manages to find the fruit, traversing a dangerous underground passage and swamp, but is captured in Queen Lolotte's perilous mountains and imprisoned in her castle. The witch demands that Rosella undertake three tasks for her in order for Rosella to earn her freedom and a big reward. Rosella reluctantly agrees and captures a unicorn, steals the golden hen and recovers [[Pandora's Box]] for Lolotte who intends to use the items to increase her evil power and influence. Lolotte reveals that her hideous and deformed son Edgar has fallen in love with Rosella and she intends for them to marry, trapping Rosella and condemning King Graham and Genesta to death. However, a sympathetic Edgar helps Rosella escape and she slays Lolotte with Cupid's bow. Rosella recovers the talisman, the hen and Pandora's Box and rescues the unicorn. In order to keep Pandora's Box from being used for evil again, Rosella returns it to its tomb and seals the entrance so that no one else can ever enter.

Rosella returns the talisman and the hen to Genesta, saving her life. As a reward for his help and kindness, Genesta transforms Edgar into a handsome young man, but Rosella rejects Edgar's marriage proposal although she expresses hope that they will meet again [[King's Quest VII|someday]]. Rosella is teleported back to Daventry where the fruit heals King Graham, much to the joy of his family.

Although Rosella's primary quest is to retrieve the magic fruit needed to save King Graham, it is possible to return to Daventry without completing this task, but this leads to a tragic alternate ending to the game where Rosella returns to Daventry in time to witness her father die instead of saving his life. A second alternate ending exists where if Rosella is caught after escaping from her room, she will be forced to marry Edgar and spend the rest of her life in Tamir. Winning the game will not resolve all storylines, although that will be the goal in the sequels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/vgmuseum_sierra_kq5-hintbook/kq5-hintbook#page/n5/mode/2up|title=MOCAGH.ORG: Sierra On-Line: kq5 hintbook|access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref>

== Development and release ==
With the SCI engine, Sierra dropped disk-based copy protection schemes in favor of requiring the user to enter a word from the manual, as the new-generation games were designed primarily to be installed and run from a hard disk. ''King's Quest IV'' was the first commercially released game for [[IBM PC compatible]]s to support [[sound card]]s instead of only the standard built-in speaker. In addition to the familiar [[PC speaker]] and [[List of TRS-80 and Tandy-branded computers|Tandy]] sound, it could utilize [[Ad Lib, Inc.|AdLib]], [[Disney Sound Source]], [[IBM Music Feature Card]], or [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] boards. The new SCI engine allowed the game's designers to incorporate an orchestrated musical score along with more complex sound effects, a previously unattainable feat. To ensure an immersive soundtrack, composer William Goldstein was hired to write the game's musical score, totaling over 75 short music pieces.

The series' author [[Roberta Williams]] wrote in the notes to the ''King's Quest Collection Series'': "Before ''King's Quest IV'' was released, word leaked out that Graham would have a heart attack and might die. Fans were upset enough to write in, asking to save Graham. I wanted ''King's Quest IV'' to have some pressure applied to you: a timed game, taking place over a 24-hour period, so you roam around during the day and eventually it turns to night. I don't remember other games using the same scenes at night; it looked creepy".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lB4PAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA417|title=Games vs. Hardware. The History of PC Video Games: The 80's|last=Purcaru|first=Bogdan Ion|date=2014|publisher=Purcaru Ion Bogdan|language=en}}</ref> With a female protagonist and more colorful graphics than in her earlier games, she attempted to appeal more specifically to female demographics. As the game's aspect that satisfied her most, she said: "I like the heroine, Rosella. I guess because she's a part of me that's coming out. I really identified with her. Sometimes she's delicate, but she's strong, knows what she wants, she's not afraid to do what she has to do. She's courageous. It was fun for me to do a female character".<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=December 1998|title=Interview with Roberta Williams|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_54/page/n19|magazine=Computer Gaming World|volume=54}}</ref>

[[File:Screenshot_from_King's_Quest_IV,_PC_SCI.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot from the SCI version of the same opening cutscene.]]

The game was simultaneously produced and published in the AGI and SCI engines. The AGI engine was used in all earlier Sierra adventure games, the SCI in all later ones. SCI supported higher-resolution graphics (320×200 resolution versus 160×200), more sophisticated animation, mouse, and sound card support. Some older features like [[CGA composite mode]] and [[PCjr]] support were removed. Memory requirements for SCI games were thus double those of AGI games (512&nbsp;kB vs 256k). The new engine was designed for then-current IBM-compatible hardware (i.e. 8–16&nbsp;MHz 286 or 386 machines with [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] or [[VGA]] graphics and a hard disk) and ran poorly on older [[Intel 8086|8086]] computers. The game was previewed at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] on June 4, 1988.<ref name="filfre">{{cite web|url=https://www.filfre.net/2016/08/sierra-gets-creative/|title=Sierra Gets Creative|date=August 26, 2016|access-date=May 10, 2018}}</ref>

''King's Quest IV'' was the only native-mode SCI game to also have an AGI version (some games originally made with the AGI engine like the original ''[[King's Quest: Quest for the Crown|King's Quest]]'' were released in updated SCI versions). This was done mostly as a fall-back measure because the SCI engine was new and unproven, and also for the large existing user base of 8086 machines. However, only a quite small number of copies were sold. It was discontinued within a few months of the game's August 1988 release. The two games are identical in gameplay, except that the SCI version was updated with some additional parser responses. The AGI version 2.0 contains the "[[Beam me up, Scotty|beam me]]" [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]], which transported Rosella to a ''[[Star Trek]]''-esque room with all of the development team present (this Easter egg is not present in any SCI version).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sierrahelp.com/Misc/EasterEggs/KQEasterEggs.html |title=King's Quest Easter Eggs – The Sierra Help Pages |publisher=Sierrahelp.com |access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref> A version identical to the AGI version was released on the [[Apple IIGS]] with improved music and effects (over the [[MS-DOS]] AGI counterpart); the IIGS port does not use the SCI engine for performance reasons.
