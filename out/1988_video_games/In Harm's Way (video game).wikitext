==Reception==
Lt. H. E. Dille reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''In Harm's Way'' is an excellent simulation of operational level decision-making that also remains faithful to the historical period covered. Those players who demand complete tactical control may be frustrated by this simulation, but for those who are willing to accept that chaos and confusion are a natural part of warfare, this is a "must" to add to a game library."<ref name="CGW57">{{cite magazine |last=Dille |first=Lt.
