{{nihongo foot|'''''Bad Dudes Vs.

It was also ported to many computer and game console home systems.

In ''Bad Dudes'', the players are set in the role of the titular duo tasked with rescuing "[[Ronald Reagan|President Ronnie]]" from [[ninja]] kidnappers. The game was met with commercial success, becoming one of America's top five highest-grossing [[1988 in video games|arcade games of 1988]]. The arcade version received generally positive reviews from critics, while the home conversions received a generally positive to mixed critical reception. It has since become widely known for its general premise and introductory [[cut scene]].

==Plot==
===Prologue===
The game is set in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, where President Ronnie (based on 40th President [[Ronald Reagan]]) has been abducted by the evil Dragon Ninja. The game's intro begins with the following introduction: "Rampant ninja related crimes these days&nbsp;... [[White House|Whitehouse]] is not the exception". A [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent speaks to the titular "Bad Dudes", a tough and heroic duo of street-smart brawlers named Blade and Striker: "President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?"

===Chapters===
The Bad Dudes pursue the Dragon Ninja through the [[New York City]] streets, onto a moving big rig truck, through a large storm sewer, through a forest, onto a freight train on an old [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] line (where the titular character of another Data East arcade game, ''[[Chelnov]]'', can be seen being transported in a frozen container in the arcade version), through a cave, and into an underground factory in order to save President Ronnie.<ref name=manual>''Bad Dudes'' NES instruction manual</ref>

===Epilogue (US version)===
After the Bad Dudes defeat the Dragon Ninja, they celebrate by eating [[hamburger]]s with President Ronnie. At the very end, President Ronnie is seen holding a burger while standing between the Bad Dudes. Behind them are many security guards, with [[the White House]] in the background.

===Epilogue (Japan version)===
President Ronnie gives the Bad Dudes a statue of them, as a reward for rescuing and protecting both Washington, D.C., and its leader. The Bad Dudes are seen leaning against a fence on a sidewalk next to their statue.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:BadDudesGameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay of the arcade version]]
The [[gameplay]] of ''Bad Dudes'' allows up to two players to play at once.

Player one controls the character Blade, who wears white pants, and player two controls the character Striker, who wears green pants. Players start with the ability to do basic punches, kicks, and jumps. Some moves are special like spinning kicks and the ability to charge themselves up with [[Qi|"inner energy"]] by holding the punch button to throw a powerful long-range attack that hits all opponents in front of the player. Players will also come across several [[power-up]]s; some are weapons like knives and [[nunchaku]]s, some recharge a player's health, and yet others add a few seconds to the remaining time.<ref name=manual/>

The various types of enemies encountered in the game have their own means of attack. The basic blue-colored ninjas directly charge the player, while some leap with their swords, or throw [[shuriken]] and [[makibishi]]; there are also acrobatic [[kunoichi]] (female ninjas), attack dogs, and people who are on fire. The enemies may be beaten down or avoided. Most enemies can be beaten with only a single hit of any kind, and multiple enemies can be defeated with one hit if they are standing close together.

At the end of each level, one of the super warrior [[boss (video games)|boss]]es will appear, who needs to be defeated to progress to the next level. The first of them, at the climax of the City stage, is Karnov, who makes a [[cameo appearance]] from [[Karnov|the Data East game of the same name]].<ref name="ja_credits">Closing credits of ''DragonNinja'', the Japanese arcade version of ''Bad Dudes VS. DragonNinja''.</ref> Second, at the climax of the Truck stage, is a talon-wielding ninja, Iron Arm. Third, at the climax of the Sewer stage, is Kamui, another ninja master, who creates illusions by copying himself. Fourth, at the climax of the Forest stage, is Animal, a behemoth-of-a-man who is also not a ninja. Fifth, at the climax of the Train stage, is Akaikage, a [[kusarigama]]-wielding warrior. Last, at the climax of the Cave stage, is Devil Pole, a [[bōjutsu]]-master. Finally, the leader of the Dragon Ninja gang, coincidentally also called Dragon Ninja, appears during the climax in his headquarters, where there is a final showdown on a helicopter. The background music during the fight with him is similar to the main theme in ''Karnov''.{{#tag:ref|In later levels, another version of him with a different color palette sometimes appears as a minor enemy referred to as [[Kusa mochi|Kusamoci]] Karnov.<ref name="ja_credits"/>|group="note"}}

Each boss has his own special attack: Karnov, for example, can breathe fire at the player. At the successful completion of each level and after defeating the boss, the dude(s) will strike a "bad" pose and proclaim, "I'm bad!". The shout, and the game's American [[wordmark]] logo are both similar to the Michael Jackson song "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]", released the previous year. In the Japanese version of the game, this quote was originally a [[battle cry]].

==History==
The game was [[Porting|ported]] to several home systems, including the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[MSX]] and PC [[DOS]] in 1988. [[Quicksilver Software]] developed the Apple II and PC ports with the rest produced by UK-based [[Ocean Software]] and published in Europe on their Imagine label<ref name='retrogamerdragonninja'>{{cite magazine |title=Ultimate Guide: Bad Dudes vs Dragon Ninja|magazine=Retro Gamer|issue=133|publisher=Imagine|author=Mike Bevan|date=11 September 2014|pages=38–43|url=|access-date=}}</ref> as ''Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja''. These versions were titled ''Dragon Ninja'' in-game,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/bad-dudes/screenshots/gameShotId,67195/|title=Bad Dudes Screenshots for Amiga|website=MobyGames|access-date=March 23, 2019}}</ref> and the ''"Bad Dudes Vs."'' was heavily de-emphasised in the cover art,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/bad-dudes/cover-art|title=Bad Dudes (1988) Amiga box cover art|website=MobyGames|access-date=March 23, 2019|archive-date=March 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323003644/https://www.mobygames.com/game/bad-dudes/cover-art|url-status=dead}}</ref> resulting in the game commonly being known by the latter title (including among the European gaming press of the time<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/bad-dudes/mobyrank|title=Bad Dudes for Amiga (1988) MobyRank|website=MobyGames|access-date=March 23, 2019}}</ref>).

On July 14, 1989, a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES/Famicom]] port was developed by Data East and published in Japan by [[Namco]] as ''DragonNinja''. In North America, the same version was released the same year by Data East USA simply as ''Bad Dudes'', featuring an illustration by Marc Ericksen.

After Data East became defunct due to their bankruptcy in 2003, [[G-Mode]] bought the intellectual rights to the arcade game, as well as most other Data East games, and licensed them globally.<ref name="g-mode webpage">{{cite web|url=http://www.dataeastgames.com/title_badudes_doragonninja.html|title=Bad Dudes vs Dragonninja - DATA EAST GAMES|publisher=G-Mode|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121012404/http://www.dataeastgames.com/title_badudes_doragonninja.html|archive-date=November 21, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=August 11, 2008}}</ref> The arcade version is also featured, along with several other Data East arcade games, on the [[Wii]] title ''[[Data East Arcade Classics]]'', produced by [[Majesco Entertainment]] with permission from G-Mode. In 2018, the [[Nintendo Switch]] version was released in the ''[[Johnny Turbo's Arcade]]'' series, featuring a new, live-action intro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ninten-switch.com/dragonninja-switch-ver-announcement|title=Nintendo Switch版『ドラゴンニンジャ (Bad Dudes)』が3月21日に海外で配信決定！データイーストの怪作アクション|website=Nintendo Switch|date=March 14, 2018 |language=ja|access-date=March 22, 2019}}</ref> It uses a fanart mockup screenshot but actually features the original arcade graphics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/03/random_bad_dudes_vs_dragonninja_fan_art_is_being_used_to_promote_eshop_release|title=Random: Bad Dudes vs. DragonNinja Fan Art Is Being Used To Promote eShop Release|date=March 16, 2018|website=Nintendo Life|language=en-GB|access-date=March 22, 2019}}</ref>

The 8-bit versions and the PC version lacked the two-player cooperative mode in any form, instead having an alternating two-player mode. The title screen of the Japanese version became different, while the English version's was unchanged. The Secret Service agent's quote at the intro screen to the NES version was phrased slightly differently as "The President has been kidnapped by ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the President?", while the Famicom counterpart's quote was slightly similar to the international arcade and NES quotes. The reference to President Ronnie (an overt reference to former president of the United States Ronald Reagan) was removed because [[Nintendo of America]] did not allow political content in games. In that version, the President bears a resemblance to [[George H. W. Bush]], who was the president of the United States when the NES version was released. The endings of the Japanese and English language versions of the NES port are based on the international arcade version, but the Japanese version does not show the credits but only shows "The End" at the White House scene and lasts a shorter time than the English version. The 8-bit home computer versions lacked the intro from either the arcade or the NES versions. The "I'm bad!" speech was only present in the NES version but it does not sound identical to its arcade counterpart.

===Arcade===
The game was commercially successful in arcades. In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''DragonNinja'' on their May 15, 1988, issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=332|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=May 15, 1988|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref> In North America, it was a high-earning arcade game,<ref>{{cite news |title=[[:File:Bad Dudes DragonNinja arcadeflyer.png|How Can Something This Bad Be So Good for Your Earnings?

The arcade game received generally positive reviews from critics upon release. ''[[Sinclair User]]'' magazine, in its January 1989 issue, gave it the award for best [[1988 in video games|Beat 'Em Up of 1988]].<ref name="sinclair-award" />

===Home===
In the ZX Spectrum sales charts, it was number two, behind ''[[RoboCop (1988 video game)|Robocop]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ysrnry.co.uk/ys41.htm |title=The YS Rock'n'Roll Years - Issue 41 |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |access-date=February 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126012022/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/ys41.htm |archive-date=January 26, 2014}}</ref>

The home conversions received a generally positive to mixed critical reception. ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' noted the IBM port was satisfactory and compared it favorably to similar ports of ''[[Double Dragon]]'' and ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]'', but the Apple II port suffered greatly.<ref name="CGW">{{citation | date = May 1989 | last = David M. | first = Russell | magazine = Computer Gaming World | title = Street Lethal | page = 26 | issue=59}}</ref>

President Ronnie, as he appears in the arcade version of the game, was ranked second in ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'''s list of the top ten video game politicians in 2008.<ref>Scott Sharkey, "EGM's Top Ten Videogame Politicians: Election time puts us in a voting mood", ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 234 (November 2008): 97.</ref> In 2010, [[UGO]] wrote: "No ninja game retrospective could possibly be complete without some mention of ...

==Legacy==
The game was followed by a [[1991 in video gaming|1991]] spiritual successor ''[[Two Crude]]'' (known in Japan as ''Crude Buster''). A sequel attempt, supposed to take place 23 years after the first game, was unsuccessfully attempted to be financed via [[Kickstarter]] by Pinstripe Games in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pinstripegames/bad-dudes-2 |title=Bad Dudes 2 by Pinstripe Games — Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=December 1, 2012 |access-date=February 10, 2014}}</ref>

The arcade version of the game appears in the 1989 film ''[[Parenthood (1989 film)|Parenthood]]'', in which the son of [[Steve Martin]]'s character wonders why the game is so difficult. Martin, grasping for an answer, says, "Well, they're bad dudes. That's why they call the game ''Bad Dudes''". The ''Bad Dudes'' logo can be seen at the end of Stage 4 in ''[[Sly Spy]]'', another Data East arcade game. In the 1990 film ''[[RoboCop 2]]'', Officer Duffy gets pushed by RoboCop into a ''Bad Dudes Vs.

The game's introduction, challenging the player to be a "bad enough dude to rescue the President", became a popular [[Internet meme]] and is often lampooned on various websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/philosophy-sunday-dudes.php |title=Philosophy Sunday: Dudes.

The webcomic ''[[The Adventures of Dr. McNinja]]'' often references the Bad Dudes, among many other 1980s pop culture touchstones.

An updated version of the game has been announced for release exclusively for the [[Intellivision Amico]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Intellivision® Reveals Initial Details For The Upcoming Amico™ Home Video Game Console!|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intellivision-reveals-initial-details-for-the-upcoming-amico-home-video-game-console-300734998.html|website=PR Newswire}}</ref>

==Rereleases==
Reissues of the game were nonexistent in the two decades that followed its original release. In recent years, however, rereleases of the original arcade version ''Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja'' and its NES port ''Bad Dudes'' have become increasingly common:
* ''Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja'' is one of the 15 arcade games included in [[Data East Arcade Classics]] released in February 2010 for the [[Wii]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/data_east_arcade_classics|title=Data East Arcade Classics|first=Nintendo|last=Life|date=March 1, 2010|website=Nintendo Life}}</ref>
