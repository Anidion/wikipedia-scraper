{{nihongo|'''''Face Off'''''|フェイスオフ|Feisu Ofu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[ice hockey]] arcade game developed and released by [[Namco]] for Japan only in 1988. Up to four players control players from one of eight hockey teams against each other, the objective being to score the most points before the timer ends. Similar to Namco's own ''[[Final Lap]]'', multiple cabinets can be linked together to enable multiplayer play. It runs on the [[Namco System 1]] arcade board. ''Face Off'' received a favorable critical reception for its visuals and gameplay. A digital re-release for the [[Wii Virtual Console]] was released in Japan in 2009.
