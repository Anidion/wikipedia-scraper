'''''Abrams Battle Tank''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Dynamix]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1988 for [[MS-DOS]]. Designed by [[Damon Slye]], the game is a 3D [[Vehicle simulation game|vehicle simulation]] of the [[M1 Abrams]] [[tank]]. The 1991 [[Sega Genesis]] port by [[Realtime Games Software]] was renamed to '''''M-1 Abrams Battle Tank'''''.

==Gameplay==
Although the simulation depicts the four crew positions, and is advertised as a simulation, gameplay is not actually very realistic; the missions are [[arcade game]]-like with a fixed sequence of actions to perform.<ref name="CGW"/> The graphics were very good for their time, but reviews are mixed, with many players enjoying the "fun factor" introduced by the lack of realism, and others decrying it for the same reason.

==Ports==

The port from MS-DOS to Genesis was performed by [[Realtime Games Software]] in the UK using their own 3D engine that was earlier used in ''[[Carrier Command]]'' with some tweaks to adapt it to the Genesis and the needs of the tank scenario.

==Reception==
In 1989, ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave the MS-DOS version of the game 3 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon147">{{cite journal
