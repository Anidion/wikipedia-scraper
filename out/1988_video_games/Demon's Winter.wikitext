'''''Demon's Winter''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Strategic Simulations]] in 1988. It is a sequel to SSI's 1986 ''[[Shard of Spring]]'', set two hundred years after the events of the original, featuring a game world 32-times the size of the previous one.

==Plot==
The evil sorceress Siriadne has been slain, the Shard of Spring has been recovered, and peace and prosperity returned to the fantasy island of Ymros. Two centuries later, however, great numbers of aggressive monsters have suddenly appeared, devastating the region and its inhabitants. A party of five adventurers must band together in order to combat this threat, starting only with meager skills and supplies after a kobold attack on the now-ruined village of Ildryn. Ultimately, they must uncover the source of the beasts, as well as the unnatural cold that plagues the land, and ultimately put an end to both.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] in 1988 described ''Demon's Winter'' as a general improvement over ''[[Shard of Spring]]'', although not without its own flaws. Combat was described as "uneven", with opponents either being trivial or quite difficult to defeat, while mapping was noted as being quite difficult in some areas. On the other hand, the addition of new classes and changes to the skill system were received favorably.<ref name="cgw">{{Citation | last=Scorpia | title=Winter Thunderland | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | volume=53 | pages=36–38 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=53 | date=November 1988 }}</ref> In 1993 she stated that ''Demon's Winter'' had "many improvements over the previous game and an interesting plot, although combat is not as balanced as it could be", and approved of the "refreshing" ending.<ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | accessdate=25 March 2016 | author=Scorpia | pages=34–50}}</ref> ''[[ST/Amiga Format]]'' in 1989 felt that the game took several steps forward to enhance the genre, but not without suffering in presentation. The reviewer concluded, "Unfortunately so much has been done to make the game play well that the appearance has fallen by the wayside, it looks and sounds awful which is a terrible shame, because ''Demon’s Winter'' is one of the best computer role-playing games to date." This earned the title an overall grade of 68%.<ref name="format">{{Citation | last=Barrett | first=Gary | title=Demon's Winter | periodical=[[ST/Amiga Format]] | volume=13 | pages=88 | date=July 1989 }}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' agreed, calling the game "unsatisfactory" because of graphics and gameplay.<ref name="randall198909">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-09-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_112_1989_Sep#page/n75/mode/2up | title=Game Overload | work=Compute! | date=September 1989 | accessdate=11 November 2013 | author=Randall, Neil | pages=75}}</ref>
