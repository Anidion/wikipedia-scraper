==Reception==
Wyatt Lee reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "All in all, ''Campaign Promises'' is fast enough to be a good family game; offers enough strategy to intrigue the thinking gamer; provides enough luck to attract the casual gamer; teaches enough valid lessons to make citizens think at election time; and is entertaining enough to make one play it over and over. If one does not want too cerebral a game, but is interested in politics, ''Campaign Promises'' has a lot to offer."<ref name="CGW51">{{cite magazine |last=Lee |first=Wyatt |title=Campaign '88: A Survey of Political Election Games for the Computer |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September 1988 |volume=1 |issue=51 |pages=15, 36}}</ref>
