'''Sword of Sodan''' is a [[hack and slash]] video game released for the [[Amiga]] in 1988 by Discovery Software, which also commissioned a port for the [[Apple IIGS]] (but not made public until 2018). A scaled-down version for the [[Sega Genesis]] was released in 1990 by [[Electronic Arts]], and in 1993 it was released for the Apple Macintosh [[System 7]] by [[Bethesda Softworks]].

==Plot==
Set in a [[medieval fantasy]] world, Lordan is the ruler of the northern [[monarchy|kingdom]]. Zoras, an evil [[necromancer]], is in his tower made of human bones, planning to make a second attempt to overthrow Lordan, after his first attempt was defeated by Sodan, the hero.

Zoras studied ancient parchments where he learned to experiment with long forgotten [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|spells]]. His new knowledge enabled him to conjure all kinds of nightmarish creatures, which he sent marching toward Lordan's [[castle]], leaving a path of death and destruction.

To protect his twin children, son Brodan and daughter Shardan, Lordan arranged for them to be taken from the castle across the Cthol mountains to the farthest corner of the land. After Lordan's defeat and death at Zoras' hands, his children were raised by an old, bitter man, who also trained them in the art of sword combat.

Before they start their journey to defeat Zoras, the old man hands over to them the [[sword]] of Sodan. Armed with the sword, they fight their way to castle Craggamoor and face the tyrannical Zoras. After they defeat Zoras, the people accept them as the true rulers and saviors of the land.<ref>Summarized from the Amiga manual</ref>

==Gameplay==

===Amiga===
[[Image:SwordofSodan2.jpg|thumb|left|Amiga screenshot]]

There are two [[Player character|playable characters]]: Brodan or his twin sister Shardan, whose gameplay characteristics are identical despite their physical differences. The character walks in a horizontally [[Side-scrolling video game|scrolled]] world from left to right, defeating enemies with their swords, wielding either standing or kneeling. Though the player is also equipped with a shield, it is merely for decoration. It was completely removed from the Sega Genesis version.

Before each [[Level (video games)|level]] starts, a map appears, showing the player's progress through the land on their way to castle Craggamoor. Scrolls give additional information about the current location. Once the player enters the castle, the map is replaced by a gloomy picture of an outside view of the castle. Most of the levels consist of simply fighting enemies with the sword, but sometimes the player must avoid traps or solve [[puzzle]]s.

The player starts with five [[Life (video games)|lives]], an [[Health (game terminology)|energy meter]] and a hit strength level. A player's energy is reduced every time they are hit by enemies, but their hit strength can be increased by using potions. There are different types of potions. Some increase hit strength, some give an extra life, some provide short-term [[Invincibility (video gaming)|invincibility]], while still others kill the current opponent immediately.

There are eleven different areas, five in the area surrounding the castle, and six within. The player starts at their own city gate, and progresses through the countryside towards the castle, passing through city streets, a forest and a graveyard. Once within the castle, the player wanders through [[catacomb]]-like levels, which lead to the [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard's]] tower at the end. The world is inhabited by 13 different enemies and a single supporting character, the [[ostrich]]-like creature called "the animal".

===Sega Genesis===
While the gameplay mechanic is very similar to the Amiga version, there are several differences. First, enemies attack from both directions, instead of the single direction in the Amiga game.  Second, the player relies more regularly on potions, which are also dropped more frequently and can combined to achieve different effects.  Third, the areas have been reduced from eleven to eight, with some completely deleted (e.g. the forest), while others combined. Finally, there are only eight enemies, as opposed to the thirteen in the Amiga game, however, the enemies are spawned more frequently, and in different areas.

==Development==
''Sword of Sodan'' was created by three Danish engineers from Discovery Software in 1988, while a simultaneous conversion port was worked on for the Apple IIGS by Visual Concepts. Two years later [[Innerprise Software]], who purchased the game rights, created a scaled-down port for the [[Sega Genesis]] system which differs in reduced graphics and sound quality, as well as notable changes in overall gameplay. The Genesis port was published by [[Electronic Arts]] in North America and Europe, and by [[Sega]] in Japan. The game was again ported in 1993 by [[Bethesda Softworks]] for the Apple Macintosh [[System 7]].

===Unreleased Apple IIGS port===
A partially completed port for the [[Apple IIGS]] was advertised and shown at the [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES Expo]] in 1989 by [[Visual Concepts]], Ltd (then known as "Visionware").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatisthe2gs.apple2.org.za/sword-of-sodan |title=What is the Apple IIGS? > Unreleased Games > Sword of Sodan |publisher=Whatisthe2gs.apple2.org.za |date= |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> Playable with a joystick, it was approximately 70% complete. Soon after, a three level self-playing demo was released and displayed in stores, virtually indistinguishable from the Amiga version in terms of graphics and animation fluidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualapple.org/swordofsodandisk.html |title=Virtual Apple&nbsp;– Online disk archive&nbsp;– Sword of Sodan Demo |publisher=Virtualapple.org |date= |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> Originally set to be released in mid-1989, it was pushed back several months when its programmer, Scott Patterson, was fired for misconduct and a replacement had to be found. Programmer Jimmy Huey was eventually hired, however Discovery Software went bankrupt soon after in 1990. Despite these developments, appearing in magazines ads, on display in stores and the game being included on vendor's price lists, the port remained in limbo and never released. Nearly 30 years later, on May 26, 2018, the unreleased Apple IIGS port was unearthed and made public, revealing an entirely playable and very polished version of the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.whatisthe2gs.apple2.org.za/a-development-version-sword-of-sodan-is-now-archived-it-s-playable-although-bugs-remain-on-the-iigs-right-now/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 20, 2018 |archive-date=June 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620232643/http://www.whatisthe2gs.apple2.org.za/a-development-version-sword-of-sodan-is-now-archived-it-s-playable-although-bugs-remain-on-the-iigs-right-now/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was revealed all levels are present, however five out of eleven (primarily castle areas) are missing enemy sprites or obstacles. The Apple IIGS source code required to complete programming of the game has still yet to be found.

===Canceled sequel and other ports===
Ports for the [[IBM PC]], [[Atari ST]] and the [[Commodore 64]] systems were planned but never developed.<ref>Computer + Video Games 90 Magazine (Apr 1989)</ref>

A sequel was developed but never released, however a single screenshot was shown in a magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playright.dk/screens/swordofsodan2_ami_01.jpg|language=da|format=jpg|access-date=2023-08-19|title=Unge Danskere Laver Super-Spil}}</ref>

==Reception==
According to programmer Søren Grønbech's homepage, ''Sword of Sodan'' on the Amiga was at the top 10 selling charts for more than six months and selling about 55,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sodan.dk/oldbits/sos.html |title=Sodan.dk |publisher=Sodan.dk |date= |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> Due to the violent nature of the game, it was indexed by the German [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons|BPjS/BPjM]] in 1989.

The original 1988 release for Amiga got mostly favorable reviews by the magazines, with praise for the graphics, which included large, detailed sprites, unusual for that time. However, the budget re-release in 1993 was met with negative reviews. For the Sega version, websites like I-Mockery.com or Somethingawful.com mocked the game for its bad graphics, annoying sound effects, frustrating controls and difficult gameplay.
