In the UK in 1989, a shipment of copies of the Amiga version of ''Sex Vixens from Space'' were seized by [[HM Customs and Excise|British Customs]] and subsequently destroyed due to their sexual content;<ref name=datormagazin /><ref name=amigabyte>{{cite magazine|title = Stop Sex in England!|date = March 1989|url = https://archive.org/details/AmigaByte10/page/n15/mode/2up|magazine = Amiga Byte|publisher = Elettronica 2000|issue = 10|page = 17|language = Italian}}</ref><ref name=sinclair /><ref name=infodestroyed /><ref name=auscom /> while other publications did not specify a number, ''[[.info (magazine)|.info]]'' stated that 75 copies were destroyed.<ref name=infodestroyed>{{cite magazine|title = Dangerous|date = January 1989|url = https://archive.org/details/info-magazine-24/page/n31/mode/2up|magazine = .info|publisher = Info Publications Ltd|issue = 24|page = 30}}</ref> Joe Hubbard from Free Spirit Software defended ''Sex Vixens' '' sexual content in a statement to ''The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review'', stating that "While ''Sex Vixens from Space'' may be a bit racy, it is not pornographic. Apparently, the British authorities are either quite prudish or completely lacking a sense of humor. Regardless, freedom of artistic expression and the freedom to disseminate such are cornerstones of democracy.

It's a heck of a lot tamer than ''Strip Poker''."<ref name=sinclair>{{cite magazine|title = Sex Vixens from Space|date = February 1989|url = https://archive.org/stream/YourSinclair37Jan89/YourSinclair/YourSinclair38-Feb89#page/n7/mode/2up|magazine = Your Sinclair|publisher = Dennis Publishing|issue = 38|page = 8}}</ref>

In an interview with Italian gaming magazine ''Amiga Magazine'', the president of Free Spirit Software, Joseph Hubbard, expressed that ''Sex Vixens from Space'' was inspired by the 1974 [[sexploitation film]] ''[[Flesh Gordon]]'', stating that "When we made ''Sex Vixens'', we thought of an old soft-core movie called ''Flesh Gordon'' ... It gave the public some eroticism and a lot of fun, although not necessarily in that order."<ref name=interview /> When asked about the moral impact of sexual computer games, Hubbard expressed that "Everyone has some fantasy, and there's nothing wrong with that. A computer cannot do more damage than what an individual can already do on their own. I prefer to see people play with erotic software rather than violent games."<ref name=interview /> Hubbard further expressed that "Anyone can sit at their computer and exterminate hundreds of aliens, or human beings in enemy uniforms ... Do you think this is healthier or less dangerous than sex?"<ref name=interview>{{cite magazine|title = Think big, big games: Free Spirit|date = June 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/Amiga-Magazine-13/page/n55/mode/2up|magazine = Amiga Magazine|publisher = Gruppo Editoriale Jackson|issue = 13|page = 57-58|language = Italian}}</ref>

In a June 1990 issue of ''[[STart]]'' magazine, the plot of ''Sex Vixens from Space'' was given as an example of [[Sexism and video games|sexism in the gaming industry]] and [[Sexual objectification#Sexual_objectification of women|objectification of women]] in media.<ref name=STart>{{cite magazine|title = Who's Buying Now? |date = June 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/STart-Magazine-Issue-34/page/n35/mode/2up|magazine = STart|publisher = Antic Publishing|last = Johnson|first = Amy H.|issue = 34|page = 36-37}}</ref> In 1996, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' declared ''Sex Vixens from Space'' the 19th-worst computer game ever released, stating that "This funny, sexy adventure game was neither funny, sexy nor adventurous."<ref name=cgw150>{{cite magazine | author=Staff | title=150 Best (and 50 Worst) Games of All Time | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |publisher = Ziff Davis | date=November 1996 | issue=148 | pages=94 |url = https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_148/page/n97/mode/2up}}</ref>

German gaming magazine ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' gave the Amiga version of ''Sex Vixens from Space'' an overall score of 3.2 out of 12, summarizing it as a "soft porno computer game" and calling the game's sexual content 'more tame' than what the cover or advertisements suggest. ''ASM'' criticized ''Sex Vixens from Space's'' graphics and text input, expressing that "If you're hoping for crisp graphics, you'll be disappointed. What is also disappointing is the adventure, specifically the core elements that determine the quality of the adventure. The parser should be red in the face should you flatter it by describing it as such. The graphics are thoroughly low quality, and the title screen is an absolute catastrophe: for this alone Free Spirit Software should be ashamed until the end of their days." ''ASM'' also criticized ''Sex Vixens' '' plot as "stupid", as well as its 'disappointing' amount of sexual content, stating that "there is too little sex for a computer-porno, not enough processing power for a proper adventure, and too much money for both. Overall, the game's forgettable!"<ref name=asm>{{cite magazine|title=Weder sexy noch sonst was!|trans-title = Neither sexy nor anything else!|date = December 1988|url = https://archive.org/details/asm_magazine-1988-12/page/n87/mode/2up|magazine = Aktueller Software Markt|publisher = Tronic Verlag|first = Bernd|last = Zimmermann|page = 88|language = German}}</ref>

''[[.info (magazine)|.info]]'' gave the Amiga version of ''Sex Vixens from Space'' an overall score of 2.5 stars out of 5, beginning their review by lamenting the game's glitches, expressing that "I wanted to like this game, and I know I would if it worked", but praised the game's adult content, stating that "The adults-only adventure game premise has been tried before, and this one comes very close to succeeding." ''.info'' further criticized ''Sex Vixens' '' glitches, expressing that "all the effort has gone into the graphics and story rather than the programming", particularly criticizing the game's parser and text input, noting the 'limited' commands and stating that the game has abrupt [[lag (video games)|lag]] spikes in which both the game and the parser are unresponsive. ''.info'' praised ''Sex Vixens' '' humor and "quite well done" graphics, but expressed that the game needed to be patched by the developers, concluding that "I hope Free Spirit will do the necessary fixes, because ''Sex Vixens'' has all the potential to become a deliciously funny and entertaining game."<ref name=inforeview>{{cite magazine|title = Sex Vixens from Space Amiga Review|date = November 1988|url = https://archive.org/details/Info_Issue_23_1988-11_Info_Publications_US/page/n49/mode/2up|magazine = .info |publisher = Info Publications Ltd|issue = 23|page = 48|last = Malcolm|first = Tom}}</ref>

Swedish gaming magazine ''Datormagazin'' gave the Amiga version of ''Sex Vixens from Space'' an overall score of 2 out of 10, bluntly captioning their review by stating that "''Sex Vixens from Space'' is a piece of shit. Apparently it's broken too, and not even so-bad-it's-funny." ''Datormagazin'' criticizes the game's plot as "tasteless" and furthermore calls ''Sex Vixens'' "a game which is so bad that you wonder why it even exists". ''Datormagazin'' praised ''Sex Vixens' '' "very well made" graphics, but expressed that they didn't make up for the game's shortcomings, stating that "what good will good graphics do if the rest of the game is pure shit?" ''Datormagazin'' criticized the lack of a save feature, expressing that it "characterizes the game's terrible quality well", and noted a glitch where if the player drops an item after picking it up for the first time, it may no longer be picked up. ''Datormagazin'' concluded their review by expressing that "[''Sex Vixens''] can be summarized in a single word: Avoid!"<ref name=datormagazin>{{cite magazine|title = Sex Vixens from Space|date = February 1989|url = https://archive.org/stream/Datormagazin1989/Datormagazin_1989_nr03#page/n15/mode/2up|magazine = Datormagazin|publisher = Egmont Publishing|last = Reuterswärd|first = Andreas|page = 16|language = Swedish|volume = 4|issue = 3}}</ref>

''QuestBusters'' reviewed the Amiga version of the game in a September 1989 issue, criticizing the game's "inconsistent" interface & inputs, and "far below average" parser. ''QuestBusters'' noted ''Sex Vixens' '' possible inputs as 'limited', stating that "In most situations, the program won't even let you examine much of the surroundings" and expressed that this limited the game's puzzles, saying that "There aren't a lot of logical puzzles, since the parser won't even let you examine most items, let alone use them. Basically, all you can do is "make love" or "talk" to the women". ''QuestBusters'' further criticized the impact of ''Sex Vixens' '' limited inputs with regards to puzzles, expressing that "There's only one solution for each puzzle, and with such a limited vocabulary, you can fall into the trap of knowing the answer but get stuck trying to guess what synonym the game wants to hear." ''QuestBusters'' praised ''Sex Vixens'' futuristic graphics as "slick and colorful", but criticized the 'bad' quality of the art of women in-game, stating that "Not only are the majority of the women ugly, but the actual drawings are drastically inferior to that of the space ships". ''QuestBusters'' furthermore criticized ''Sex Vixens'' minimal on-screen interaction with NPCs, expressing that "While most of these graphics [are of] professional quality, there are no people in 99% of them. This creates, oddly enough for a sex-oriented game, a sterile environment." ''QuestBusters'' criticized ''Sex Vixens' '' nudity as 'ugly and unappealing', and further expressed that the game's "limited" erotic text was similarly unattractive. ''QuestBusters'' condemned the lack of a save feature as 'unreasonable' for a modern adventure game, and also criticized the lack of music and sound effects.<ref name=questbusters>{{cite magazine|title = Sex Vixens in Space|date = September 1989|url = https://archive.org/details/vgmuseum_questbusters_qbustersVI9/page/n5/mode/2up|magazine = QuestBusters|last = Addams|first = Shay|volume = 6|issue = 9|page = 6, 14}}</ref>

Italian gaming magazine ''Game Republic'' noted ''Sex Vixens from Space'' as an oddity in a 2013 retrospective review, praising its "interesting narrative" but noted it as being "undeniably in poor taste" at times. '' Game Republic'' praised ''Sex Vixens from Space's'' "bizarre" environments and over-the-top presentation, calling it "a [[space opera]] as absurd as it is surprising".<ref>{{cite magazine|title = Weirdogames Inc.: Sex Vixens from Space|date = June 2013|url = https://archive.org/details/GameRepublic149/page/n91/mode/2up |magazine = Game Republic|publisher = Play Lifestyle Media|issue = 149|language = Italian|page = 93}}</ref>
