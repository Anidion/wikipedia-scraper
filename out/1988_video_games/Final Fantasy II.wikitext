{{nihongo foot|'''''Final Fantasy II'''''|ファイナルファンタジーII|Fainaru Fantajī Tsū|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha <!-- See [[WP:JFN]] -->}} is a [[fantasy]] [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] in 1988 for the [[Family Computer]] as the second installment of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. The game has received numerous [[video game remake|enhanced remakes]] for the [[WonderSwan|WonderSwan Color]], the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], the [[Game Boy Advance]], the [[PlayStation Portable]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Windows]]. As neither this game nor ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'' were initially released outside Japan, ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' was originally released in North America as ''Final Fantasy II'', so as not to confuse players. Following enhanced versions for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in 2010 and 2012 respectively, the game was re-released again as part of the 2021 ''Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster'' series.<ref>{{Cite web|title=FINAL FANTASY PIXEL REMASTER|url=https://finalfantasypixelremaster.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/|access-date=2021-08-27|website=FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster|language=en|archive-date=August 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210827010152/https://finalfantasypixelremaster.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The game's story centers on four youths whose parents were killed during an army invasion by the empire of Palamecia, who are using hellspawn to conquer the world. Three of the four main characters join a rebellion against the empire, embarking on missions to gain new magic and weapons, destroy enemy superweapons, and rescue leading members of the resistance. The Game Boy Advance remake adds a bonus story after the game is completed.

''Final Fantasy II'' introduced many elements that would later become staples of the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise, including [[chocobo]]s and the recurring character [[Cid (Final Fantasy)|Cid]]. It also eliminated the traditional [[experience point]] leveling system of the previous and later games in the series, instead introducing an [[Experience point#Activity-based progression|activity-based progression]] system where the characters' statistics increase according to how they are used or acquired. Despite being advertised as a sequel to ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', the game includes no characters and locations from the first game. ''Final Fantasy II'' received little attention from non-Japanese reviewers at its initial release, though its remakes have garnered favorable reviews.

==Gameplay==
''Final Fantasy II'' features gameplay similar to that of its predecessor, ''Final Fantasy''. The player can freely roam an [[overworld]] containing several towns and dungeons. A menu-based system allows the player to outfit each character with equipment and up to two—often disposable—items for battle. Magic spells are assigned to the character from the item menu, and certain spells, such as "Cure", spelled "Kearu" (IPA: [kéərɯ]) in the Japanese versions, can be used outside of battle.<ref name="Origins1">{{cite book | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy Origins instruction manual | page=17 | publisher=Square Enix | id=SLUS-05141}}</ref> The player can also [[saved game|save]] their progress on the overworld. Weapons, armor, items, and [[Final Fantasy magic|magic spells]] can be purchased at shops, and townspeople provide useful information for the player's progression through the game. One new feature is the "Word Memory" system: when in [[Dialog tree|conversation]] with [[non-player character]]s (NPCs), the player can "ask" about and "memorize" special keywords or phrases, which can later be repeated to other NPCs to gain more information or unlock new actions. Similarly, there exist a handful of special items that can be shown to NPCs during conversation or used on certain objects, which have the same effect.<ref name="Origins">{{cite book | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy Origins instruction manual | pages=15, 22 | publisher=Square Enix | id=SLUS-05141}}</ref> Characters and monsters are no longer separated into separate windows in the battle screen as they were in the first ''Final Fantasy'', and players can see their current and total hit points below the battle. Players can also fight with less than four characters in their party, which was not possible in the first game. ''Final Fantasy II'' introduced the [[chocobo]], the signature ''Final Fantasy'' mascot, which lets characters ride to a location at great speed without being attacked by enemies. The recurring character Cid was also introduced, and a character of the same name has appeared in every main-series game since.<ref name="FFII"/>

A line of trees is displayed above the battle scene, and two white-rimmed black boxes cover the bottom of the image, with one displaying the HP and MP of the four characters and the other displaying their whacky water weasels in Japanese.]]

On the overworld and within dungeons, [[random encounter]]s with enemies can be fought to improve each character's [[Statistic (role-playing games)|attributes]].<ref name="Origins2">{{cite book | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy Origins instruction manual | page=22 | publisher=Square Enix | id=SLUS-05141}}</ref> Unlike the original ''Final Fantasy'', players cannot upgrade their characters' classes. The game is also one of the few games in the series to not use [[experience point|experience-based levels]]. Instead, each character participating in battle develops depending on what actions they take. For instance, characters who frequently use a particular type of weapon will become more adept at wielding a weapon of that type, and will also increase in physical strength and accuracy.<ref name="FFII"/><ref name="Origins2"/> Attributes include hit points, magic points, magic power, stamina, strength, spirit, agility, intelligence, and evasion. [[Hit point]]s (HP) and [[magic point]]s (MP) increase with their use; a character who takes a heavy amount of damage in a battle might earn an increase in maximum HP, while a character who uses a lot of MP during battle might increase their maximum MP.<ref name="Origins2"/> This experience system had several unintended consequences that allowed characters to gain much more experience than intended, such as players having their characters attack each other and repeatedly cast spells, thus causing their HP and abilities to grow extensively.<ref name="FFII"/> ''Final Fantasy II'' uses the same [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]] [[Conditional Turn-Based Battle System|battle system]] seen in the original ''Final Fantasy'', with battle parties consisting of up to four characters at a time. The game introduces a "back row" in battle, within which characters or enemies are immune to most physical attacks, but can be harmed with [[Bow and arrow|bows]] and magical attacks.<ref name="Origins1"/>

''Final Fantasy II'' features four playable characters as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. Primary characters include {{nihongo|Firion|フリオニール|Furionīru|"Frioniel" in the Japanese release and English NES prototype}}, a resident of the country of Fynn and the main protagonist; {{nihongo|Maria|マリア}}, a soft-spoken archer and dedicated enemy of the Empire; {{nihongo|Guy|ガイ|Gai|"Gus" in the remake for the PlayStation}}, a simple monk who communicates with animals; and {{nihongo|Leon|レオンハルト|Reonharuto|"Leonhart" in the Japanese release and English NES prototype}}, a conflicted dark knight who is missing for most of the game.<ref name="FFII"/><ref name="OriginsCharacters">{{cite book | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy Origins instruction manual | page=15 | publisher=Square Enix | id=SLUS-05141}}</ref> Five playable characters temporarily join the party to assist Firion, Maria, and Guy in their missions for the rebellion. These are {{nihongo|Gordon|ゴードン|Gōdon}}, the prince of Kashuan and a member of the rebellion; {{nihongo|Josef|ヨーゼフ|Yōzefu}}, a villager in the town of Salamand; {{nihongo|Leila|レイラ|Reira|"Reila" in the Japanese release and English NES prototype}}, a pirate; {{nihongo|Minwu|ミンウ|Min'u|"Mindu" in the PlayStation remake and "Ming-Wu" in the Japanese release and English NES prototype}}, who is a [[White Mage (Final Fantasy)|White Mage]] with the rebellion, and {{nihongo|Ricard Highwind|リチャード・ハイウインド|Richādo Haiuindo|"Gareth" in the PlayStation remake, Edward in the English NES prototype and "Richard" in the Japanese release}}, who is the first dragoon to appear in the series.<ref name="FFII"/>

Firion and the  {{nihongo|Emperor of Palamecia|パラメキア皇帝|Paramekia Kōtei}} (named {{nihongo|Mateus|マティウス|Matiusu}} in Kenji Terada's novelization of the game) are the respective hero and villain representing ''Final Fantasy II'' in ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy|Dissidia 012]]'' and ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy NT|Dissidia NT]]'', fighting games featuring characters from across the series. Firion is voiced by [[Hikaru Midorikawa]] in the Japanese versions and by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] in the English versions; Mateus is voiced by [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] in the Japanese versions and [[Christopher Corey Smith]] in the English versions. In the PlayStation's opening FMV of ''Final Fantasy II'', Firion is also voiced by Yukimasa Obi, while Maria is played by [[Noriko Shitaya]], Guy by [[Kenta Miyake]], and Leon by [[Takayuki Yamaguchi (voice actor)|Takayuki Yamaguchi]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

===Story===
''Final Fantasy II'' begins as Firion, Maria, Guy and Leon are attacked by Palamecian Black Knight soldiers and left for dead. Firion, Maria, and Guy are rescued by Princess Hilda, who has established a rebel base in the town of Altair after her kingdom of Fynn was invaded by the Emperor. Hilda denies their request to join the rebel army because they are too young and inexperienced. The three set off for Fynn in search of Leon; there they find a dying Prince Scott of Kashuan, Hilda's fiancé, who informs them that a former nobleman of Kashuan, Borghen, betrayed the rebellion and became a General in the Imperial army. The party returns to Altair to inform Hilda. She allows the group to join the rebellion and asks them to journey north to find [[Mithril|mythril]], a metal which could be used to create powerful weapons. The party makes its way north to the occupied village of Salamand, saves the villagers forced to work in the nearby mines, kills Borghen, and retrieves the mythril.

For their next mission, the party is sent to the city of Bafsk to prevent the construction of a large airship known as the Dreadnought; however, it takes off just as they arrive. After retrieving the Sunfire, a weapon which can blow up the Dreadnought, they watch helplessly as an airship with Hilda on board is captured by the Dreadnought. When the Dreadnought lands to stock up on supplies, the party rescues Hilda and throws the Sunfire into the airship's engine. Before escaping from the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight whom Maria thinks she recognizes as Leon.

On his deathbed, the King of Fynn tasks the party to seek the help of the seemingly extinct dragoons of Deist. In Deist, the party finds only a mother with her son, learning that all but one of the Dragoons are dead, partly as a result of Imperial poison. After placing an egg of the last [[wyvern]] in a cavern, the party returns to Altair and rescues Hilda from the Empire a second time, before successfully reclaiming Fynn from the Imperial forces. They then travel west in search of a powerful magic item, joining forces with the last surviving dragoon on the way. The party returns to Fynn and sees that many towns have been destroyed by a [[cyclone]] summoned by the Emperor. The party calls upon the newly born last wyvern to take them to a castle inside the cyclone, where they confront and kill the Emperor. Back at Fynn, everyone celebrates the Empire's defeat, but a mortally wounded Fynn soldier arrives and reveals that Leon has taken the throne and plans to destroy the Rebels with the Imperial army.

The party enters the castle of Palamecia and confronts Leon, but the Emperor reappears in the throne room in a new demonic form, revealing he has become the ruler of Hell and returned with the intention of destroying the entire world. The party and Leon escape Palamecia Castle with the wyvern, as the castle is replaced with the palace of Hell, Pandaemonium. Leon agrees to help the group seal the Emperor away. The party travels to the Jade Passage, an underground passage to the underworld, and finds the portal to Pandaemonium, where they finally defeat the Emperor. Afterwards, Leon chooses to leave in response to the trouble he caused, though Firion assures him that he'll be welcomed back if and when he returns.

====''Soul of Rebirth''====
The ''Dawn of Souls'' remake of the game for the [[Game Boy Advance]] includes an additional storyline that takes place after the game, which follows the four party members who died during the story of the game.

Following his sacrifice to unseal the door guarding the Ultima Tome, Minwu awakens in a new area and sees someone resembling Gordon fight off Imperial soldiers. Minwu assists him, and the man soon explains he is Scott, Gordon's brother. Minwu informs him of the events up to his own demise, and the two surmise they are in the Jade Passage since they both died. They find Josef and subsequently Ricard, eventually emerging in Machanon, a village in the mirror image of Poft where the citizens are dead victims of the Emperor's conquest, including Cid and Tobul, with the former asking the group to find out where they are and why they have been called here.

The four enter the teleporter at the north edge of town and enter what Minwu believes is Pandaemonium. Climbing to the highest floor, the party meets the Light Emperor, who explains that when Firion and his allies killed him, his soul was split, with the Emperor's "dark half" falling to Hell and acquiring more power, while his light half—the Emperor they now see—ascended to Heaven. He then explains they are in Arubboth, palace of Heaven, and the cave they traveled through was Raqia, the place where fallen angels are cast down to become demons, and that he called them here to ask for forgiveness on the behalf of his dark half, and offers them eternal life with him in Arubboth if they forgive his sins.

Though the four are tempted by the offer, apparitions of their loved ones show them a vision of Firion and his allies battling the Dark Emperor in Pandaemonium. Realizing this Emperor is just as evil as the original, the four reject his offer, and defeats the Light Emperor just as Firion and his allies vanquish the Dark Emperor. As the rebels in the world of the living celebrate their victory, the specters of Minwu, Scott, Josef and Ricard watch them and wish them well, and as they fade away into peaceful rest, Minwu comments that if anyone can change man's legacy of violence, it's Firion and his friends.

==Development==
During the development of the first installment in the series, [[Square (video game company)|Square]]'s management decided to manufacture 400,000 copies of the game to make a sequel possible,<ref name="developmentFF">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/28960/Sakaguchi-discusses-the-development-of-Final-Fantasy |title=Sakaguchi discusses the development of Final Fantasy |author=Fear, Ed |date=December 13, 2007 |magazine=Develop |publisher=Intent Media |access-date=October 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922005246/http://www.develop-online.net/news/28960/Sakaguchi-discusses-the-development-of-Final-Fantasy|archive-date=September 22, 2013}}</ref> then the original Famicom (NES) version successfully shipped 520,000 copies in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gamez.itmedia.co.jp/games/articles/0912/17/news104.html|title=もっとも売れたのはどれ？ 歴代「Ff」シリーズの出荷本数をまとめてみました|access-date=December 15, 2018|archive-date=December 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214164315/http://gamez.itmedia.co.jp/games/articles/0912/17/news104.html|url-status=live}}</ref> As there were no concrete ideas for ''Final Fantasy II'' from the start, it was eventually taken in a new direction and included none of the previous game's characters or locations.<ref name="FFII" /><ref name="developmentFF" /> [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], who had previously served as the main [[video game design|planner]] for ''Final Fantasy'', assumed the role of [[Video game producer|director]] to accommodate for the larger development team.<ref name="famitsusakaguchi">{{cite magazine|title=Interview with Hironobu Sakaguchi |url=http://playstationjapan.tripod.com/Sakaguchi.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717103402/http://playstationjapan.tripod.com/Sakaguchi.html |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |date=June 5, 1998 |magazine=[[Famitsu|Shūkan Famitsu]] |publisher=[[ASCII (company)|ASCII]] |access-date=February 6, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Using the experience gained from the first installment, which focused more on fitting story ideas into their new gameplay system and game world, the developers fully crafted the story of ''Final Fantasy II'' first.

In April 1989, the game was novelized by its original scenario writer Kenji Terada under the title ''Final Fantasy II: Muma no Meikyū'' (lit. "The Labyrinth of Nightmares"). It was published in Japan exclusively by [[Kadokawa Shoten]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ファイナルファンタジー2 夢魔の迷宮 |url=http://books.yahoo.co.jp/book_detail/AAD37156/ |work=Yahoo!

==Music==
The [[Music of Final Fantasy I and II|music for ''Final Fantasy II'']] was later arranged by [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]] for the WonderSwan Color, PlayStation, and Game Boy Advance remakes. Although the two soundtracks were composed separately, the soundtrack to ''II'' has only been released as a combined album with the soundtrack to ''Final Fantasy I''. They were first released as ''All Sounds of Final Fantasy I•II'' in 1989, which was then republished in 1994.<ref name="RPGFAS">{{cite web|author1=Gann, Patrick |author2=Schweitzer, Ben |title=All Sounds of Final Fantasy I – II |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff1&2/index.html |publisher=RPGFan |access-date=July 9, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116215146/http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff1%262/index.html |archive-date=January 16, 2013}}</ref> An arranged album of music from the two soundtracks titled ''Symphonic Suite Final Fantasy'' was also released in 1989, while ''Final Fantasy & Final Fantasy II Original Soundtrack'', a combined soundtrack album for the PlayStation versions of the games, was released in 2002 and re-released in 2004.<ref name="RPGFSSFF">{{cite web|author=Gann, Patrick |title=Final Fantasy Symphonic Suite |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ffss/index.html |publisher=RPGFan |access-date=July 9, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214253/http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ffss/index.html |archive-date=January 16, 2013}}</ref><ref name="RPGFFF12REreview">{{cite web|title=Final Fantasy I • II Original Soundtrack |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff1&2-remake/index.html |publisher=RPGFan |access-date=September 14, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116213840/http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff1%262-remake/index.html |archive-date=January 16, 2013}}</ref> The music of ''Final Fantasy II'' has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as ''[[List of Final Fantasy compilation albums#20020220 Music from Final Fantasy|20020220 music from Final Fantasy]]'', a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the games.<ref name="RPGF20020220review">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/20020220/index.html |title=20020220 – Music from FINAL FANTASY |publisher=RPGFan |access-date=April 1, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120065018/http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/20020220/index.html |archive-date=January 20, 2013}}</ref> Additionally, several songs from the game were performed as part of a medley by the [[Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra]] for the ''Distant Worlds – Music from Final Fantasy'' concert tour,<ref name="SEMOFFDinfo">{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/f/ffdistantworlds.shtml |title=Distant Worlds – Music from Final Fantasy – Album Information |publisher=Square Enix Music Online |access-date=February 22, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409215604/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/f/ffdistantworlds.shtml |archive-date=April 9, 2012}}</ref> while a different medley of songs from the game were performed by the [[New Japan Philharmonic]] Orchestra in the ''[[Final Fantasy concerts#Tour de Japon|Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy]]'' concert series.<ref name="SEMOTDJinfo">{{cite web |url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/dvds/tourdejapon.shtml |title=Album Information – Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy DVD |publisher=Square Enix Music Online |access-date=February 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120065505/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/dvds/tourdejapon.shtml |archive-date=January 20, 2013}}</ref>

==Versions and re-releases==
''Final Fantasy II'' has been remade several times for different platforms, and has frequently been packaged with the first ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' in various collections. While all of these remakes retain the same basic story and battle mechanics, various tweaks have been made in different areas, including graphics, sound, and specific game elements.

===Unreleased English version===
Following the successful North American release of the original ''Final Fantasy'' by Nintendo in 1990, [[Square Soft]], Square's North American subsidiary, began work on an English language [[Internationalization and localization|localization]] of ''Final Fantasy II'', to be called ''Final Fantasy II: Dark Shadow Over Palakia''. Assigned to the project was Kaoru Moriyama, whose later work included script translations for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' and ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' (known as ''Seiken Densetsu 2'' in Japan). Although a [[beta version]] was produced, and the game was advertised in several Square Soft trade publications, the long development time, the age of the original Japanese game and the arrival of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], the NES's successor [[video game console|console]], led Square Soft to cancel work on the ''Final Fantasy II'' localization in favor of the recently released ''Final Fantasy IV'' (which, to avoid confusing North American players, was retitled ''Final Fantasy II'').<ref name="FFII"/><ref name="Cancelled">{{cite web|author=Collette, Chris |title=Spotlight: Final Fantasy II |url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200312/200312-ffan2.shtml |publisher=LostLevels.org |access-date=August 25, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902172158/http://www.lostlevels.org/200312/200312-ffan2.shtml |archive-date=September 2, 2006}}</ref>

Although a prototype cartridge of the English NES ''Final Fantasy II'' was produced, the project was, by Moriyama's own admission, still far from complete: "We had so very limited memory capacity we could use for each game, and it was never really "translating" but chopping up the information and cramming them back in... [Additionally] our boss had no understanding in putting in extra work for the English version at that time".<ref name="Cancelled"/> In 2003, when the game was finally released to English-speaking audiences as part of ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)#Versions and re-releases|Final Fantasy Origins]]'', it was released with new graphics, music, and a brand new translation under the supervision of Akira Kashiwagi. A [[fan translation]] of the original game was also created prior to the release of ''Origins'', and makes use of an original translation as the existence of the prototype cartridge was not common knowledge at the time.<ref name="Cancelled"/>

===Re-releases===
In addition to its original Famicom release, ''Final Fantasy II'' was re-released on the WonderSwan Color in 2001, and both singularly and as part of a collection with ''Final Fantasy I'' for the PlayStation in 2002. It was released on the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of ''Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls'', on the [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2007, and for the Japanese [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] on June 16, 2009.<ref name="VCFF2">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_ff2/index.html |title=VC ファイナルファンタジーII |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |language=ja |access-date=November 30, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225121142/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_ff2/index.html |archive-date=February 25, 2010}}</ref>

The ''Final Fantasy I•II'' collection included the original game with only minor changes.

Sekito also composed a few new tracks to be used in the new [[cutscene]]s. It was published both individually (in Japan only) and alongside ''Final Fantasy I'' in a collection entitled ''Final Fantasy Origins'' (or ''Final Fantasy I+II Premium Collection'' in Japan); this was the first release of the game outside Japan.<ref>{{cite web|author=Triche, Stephen |title=Final Fantasy Origins |publisher=gamevortex.com |year=2002 |url=http://www.psillustrated.com/psillustrated/soft_rev.php/1283/final-fantasy-origins-playstation.html |access-date=March 8, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102194012/http://www.psillustrated.com/psillustrated/soft_rev.php/1283/final-fantasy-origins-playstation.html |archive-date=November 2, 2010}}</ref> The port was re-released as part of the ''Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box'' package in December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con2j5/ff_ultimate_box_game_list/ |title=Full Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box Game List |publisher=Andriasang |author=Gantayat, Anoop |date=August 31, 2012 |access-date=September 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060243/http://andriasang.com/con2j5/ff_ultimate_box_game_list/ |archive-date=September 21, 2013}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy II'' was again released in a new format in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance as part of ''Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls''.

The story was considered to be much more involved and deep than the first ''Final Fantasy'', as it involved romance and the death of characters. The game's plot was thought by some reviewers to mirror elements of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: A New Hope]]'' in its use of an orphan joining a rebellion against an empire that was building a massive ship, with a captive princess inside.<ref name="FFII"/> [[GameSpy]] praised the addition of the ability to save the game at any time, calling the feature crucial for a game on a [[handheld game console]], and in contrast to [[GameSpot]], praised the graphics, saying that while they were primitive, they were "well-suited" to the Game Boy Advance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/final-fantasy-gba-rumored/569939p1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222912/http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/final-fantasy-gba-rumored/569939p1.html|archive-date=October 4, 2013|title=Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls|last=Vassar|first=Darryl|date=December 1, 2004|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|access-date=December 2, 2009}}</ref>

The PSP version was met with generally average reviews. GameSpot described the "more intriguing" story and "key words" system as "notable" in "the evolution of the series and genre" but called the level up system "chaotic" and noted that unlike previous versions, this was shipped without a version of ''Final Fantasy I''.<ref name="GSPSPreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/final-fantasy-ii-anniversary-edition/reviews/final-fantasy-ii-anniversary-edition-review-6176175/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105020234/http://www.gamespot.com/final-fantasy-ii-anniversary-edition/reviews/final-fantasy-ii-anniversary-edition-review-6176175/|archive-date=November 5, 2012|title=Final Fantasy II Review|last=VanOrd|first=Kevin|date=August 3, 2007|website=[[GameSpot]]|access-date=November 25, 2009}}</ref> IGN described the "dialogue and story" as "much more interesting than" its predecessor and the "proficiency system not unlike what's found in ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]''" as a "semi-innovation" for its time, but also complained about the gameplay.<ref name="IGNPSPreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/26/final-fantasy-ii-review-3 |title=Final Fantasy II Review |last=Dunham |first=Jeremy |date=July 26, 2007 |website=IGN |access-date=November 25, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210032118/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/26/final-fantasy-ii-review-3 |archive-date=December 10, 2012}}</ref> Both sources praised the graphics, however.<ref name="GSPSPreview"/><ref name="IGNPSPreview"/> GameSpy, while echoing similar complaints about the "quirky and sometimes confusing" leveling system and praises for the graphics, also applauded the supposed decrease in difficulty of the game, which in the reviewers' opinion eliminated the necessity to abuse the leveling system in order to progress in the game as the player had to do in the original game.<ref name="GSpy">{{cite web|url=http://uk.psp.gamespy.com/playstation-portable/final-fantasy-ii/808381p1.html |title=Final Fantasy II |last=Graziani |first=Gabe |date=July 26, 2007 |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |access-date=December 2, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716181544/http://uk.psp.gamespy.com/playstation-portable/final-fantasy-ii/808381p1.html |archive-date=July 16, 2008}}</ref>
