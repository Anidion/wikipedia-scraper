==Reception==
John Harrington reviewed ''Head Coach'' for ''[[Games International]]'' magazine, and gave it a rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that "It is gratifying to see a small British software company come up with a reasonable sport simulation, and although the game will probably pall after a few seasons it should maintain its appeal long enough to get gridiron junkies through the baseball season."<ref name="gi13">{{cite journal | last = Harrington |first = John | title =Computer Games | journal = [[Games International]] | issue = 13 | pages =53–54 |date=February–March 1990}}</ref>
