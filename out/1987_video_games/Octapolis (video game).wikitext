'''''Octapolis''''' is a [[video game]] for the [[Commodore 64]] written by [[Finland|Finnish]] [[game programmer]] [[Jukka Tapanimäki]] and published by [[English Software]] in 1987. The game is a hybrid between a [[shoot-'em-up]] and a [[platform game]].<ref name="dome">Kauppinen, Jukka O.: ''[http://dome.fi/pelit/artikkelit/pelit/suomalaisen-pelialan-varhaiset-vuodet-ja-ensimmaiset-suomalaiset-pelit Suomalaisen pelialan varhaiset vuodet ja ensimmäiset suomalaiset pelit]'', Dome 1 November 2013. Accessed on 21 November 2015.</ref> The title comes from the eight cities in the game.

==Gameplay==
Each of the eight cities contains a short shoot-'em-up part and a longer platform game part. The shoot-'em-up part includes two screens similar to ''Sanxion'', one of which is a top-down view and the other is a side view. The game is played around a landing platform. The player's ship moves left or right automatically, and its speed can be adjusted. A sound effect tells the player when they can land on the platform and enter the platform game part. The better the player does on the shoot-'em-up part, the easier the platform game part will be.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The platform game part consists of a character resembling an [[astronaut]] moving around on single-screen (non-scrolling) rooms in which the character has to reach the exit. The character is armed with a [[raygun]] and can jump upwards or diagonally. Some enemies can be shot, some have to be avoided. The challenge is to shoot enemies well in advance and watch the movement patterns of unshootable enemies carefully to get past them. When enough rooms have been passed, the city is cleared. When all eight cities have been cleared, the game restarts with at a higher difficulty.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

==Development==
''Octapolis'' was Tapanimäki's first commercial release. Its shoot-'em-up phase resembles Stavros Fasoulas's ''[[Sanxion]]'', which inspired Tapanimäki to try designing games.<ref>Kuorikoski, p.13.</ref><ref>Saarikoski, p.267.</ref> Tapanimäki sent a demo of the game to several foreign publishers, of which Hewson, CRL and English Software replied with an offer about a publication contract. Tapanimäki agreed to English Software's contract, but the company went bankrupt soon after publishing ''Octapolis'',<ref>Kuorikoski, p.14.</ref> which limited the distribution of ''Octapolis''.<ref>Saarikoski, p.268.</ref>

The music was composed by Wally Beben.<ref name="dome"/>

==Reception==
Finnish magazine ''[[C-lehti]]'' rated the game five stars out of five.<ref name="dome"/>
