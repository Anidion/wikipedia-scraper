'''''Match Day II''''' is a [[Football (soccer)|football]] [[sports game]] part of the [[Match Day (series)|''Match Day'' series]] released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Amstrad PCW]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[MSX]] and [[Commodore 64]] platforms. It was created in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] by [[Jon Ritman]] with graphics by Bernie Drummond and music and sound by Guy Stevens<ref>[http://www.jonritman.f2s.com/games/md2/index.htm Comment about authors of the game in Ritman's home page, ritman.co.uk]</ref> (except for the Commodore version, which was a line-by-line conversion by [[John Darnell]]<ref>[http://s64.emuunlim.com/reviews/matchday2.htm Matchday II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724053455/http://s64.emuunlim.com/reviews/matchday2.htm |date=2008-07-24}} at Stadium64</ref>). It is the sequel to 1984's ''[[Match Day (video game)|Match Day]]''.

==Gameplay==
The controls consist of four directions (allowing eight directions including diagonals) and a shot button. Each team has seven players,<ref>[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/48/matchday2.htm Match Day II review at crashonline.org]</ref> including [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] and there are league and cup options available.

The game is considered highly addictive due to its difficulty level, the complete control over ball direction, power and elevation (using a Diamond Deflection System),<ref>[http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/matchdayii.htm Matchday 2 review at Your Sinclair Rock and Roll Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221113802/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/matchdayii.htm |date=2008-02-21}}</ref> and the importance of tactics and player positioning over the field (barging if necessary<ref>[http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/zxsoftware/SinclairData/M/instructions/MatchDay2.txt Match Day 2 instructions]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} at zxsoftware.co.uk</ref>), which makes it challenging to break strong defences. It was the first game to use a kickometer.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000516151934/http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/5874/footy.htm Football games] at geocities.com/SiliconValley</ref>

Some versions of the game play the song "[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]" while the players are walking to their initial positions on the field at the beginning of each half.<ref>[http://www.pressplaythenanykey.com/reviews/m.php Match Day 2 review] at pressplaythenanykey.com (in Spanish)</ref>
