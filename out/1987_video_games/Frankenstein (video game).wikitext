'''''Frankenstein''''' is a [[interactive fiction|text adventure]] game released by [[CRL Group|CRL]] in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] home computers. The game is based on the 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].

== Plot ==
[[Dr. Frankenstein]] must find and destroy his murderous escaped monster; [[Frankenstein's monster|the monster]] must remain free and learn the reason for its existence.

== Gameplay ==
''Frankenstein'' is a standard text adventure with static graphics in some locations to set the scene. It is similar to the earlier game ''[[Dracula (1986 video game)|Dracula]]'', which was produced by the same author. It is divided into three parts; the player takes the role of Dr. Frankenstein in the first two, and of his monster in the third. Part One is entitled Hard Journey, Part Two The Slaying and Part Three The Monster's Story. Part Three is only accessible once the first two parts have been completed.

In the second part the player can engage in conversation with other characters. In the third part the player has to raise the monster's intelligence which can be done by using their senses. Both this and experiences they undergo will raise their IQ rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worldofspectrum.org//pub/sinclair/games-info/f/Frankenstein.txt|title=Frankenstein 1997 Complete Documentation
