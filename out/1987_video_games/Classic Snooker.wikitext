The game received mixed reviews from critics. ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' magazine scored the game at 84%, and were positive about the game's mechanics, despite bugs, saying "The action does slow down if more than three balls are moving but this is acceptable as the whole thing is flicker free and as a bonus loads in only a few seconds."<ref name="ComputerGamer"/> German gaming review magazine ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' (ASM) scored the game at 62% saying "The game itself is quite entertaining and realistic. The running of the balls on the table, the effect, the change of direction after the billiards and the playing of the games were pretty well done."<ref name="ASM"/>

ASM were however, less positive about the game's presentation, saying "A major disadvantage of the program is that it is extremely difficult to distinguish the colors of the balls from each other. So it is hardly possible to recognize the pink, brown and red balls as well as the yellow and the white ball."<ref name="ASM"/> ASM were pleased with the graphics despite this, saying "Of course, the mentioned drawback spoils the fun, but this disadvantage is offset by the quite realistic presentation."<ref name="ASM"/> ''[[Zzap!64]]'' reviewed the game, commenting on how the poorly the game ran on the [[Commodore 16]] system, saying that the game "plays okay, but the screen tends to flicker quite violently at times and can prove most off-putting."<ref name="Zzap"/>
