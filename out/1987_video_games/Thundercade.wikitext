'''''Thundercade''''', also known as '''''Twin Formation''''' and {{nihongo|'''特殊部隊UAG'''|Tokushu Butai U.A.G.|"Special Forces U.A.G. (Un-Attached Grenadier)}}", is a [[Scrolling shooter|vertically scrolling shooter]] developed by [[SETA Corporation|SETA]] and released as an [[arcade game]] in 1987. A version for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] from [[Sammy Corporation|American Sammy]] was released in 1989.

The original arcade flyer establishes that despite a 199X treaty eliminating all nuclear weapons, a certain northerly nation was suspected of developing such weapons in secret. Therefore, the [[United States of America]] military sends in the U.A.G. elite unit consisting of an armed motorcyclist and a support bomber to quell the threat.<ref>https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/videogames/show/1817</ref> The American NES version's manual describes a slightly different story, casting players as a part of Operation Thundercade, a special forces operation battling against the nuclear threat of the Atomic Age Terrorist Organization of Miracali (AATOM).<ref name="mobygames">[http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/thundercade ''Thundercade''] at [[MobyGames]]</ref><ref name="allgame">[http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14344&tab=overview ''Thundercade''] at [[allgame]]</ref>
