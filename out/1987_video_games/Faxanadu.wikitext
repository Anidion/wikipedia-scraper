{{Nihongo foot|'''''Faxanadu'''''|ファザナドゥ|Fazanadu|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed by [[Hudson Soft]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The name was licensed by [[Video game developer|computer game developer]] [[Falcom|Nihon Falcom]] ("Falcom") and was developed and released in [[Japan]] by [[Hudson Soft]] for the Famicom in 1987. [[Nintendo]] released the game in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] as a first-party title under license from Hudson Soft.

''Faxanadu'' is a spin-off or side-story of ''[[Xanadu (video game)|Xanadu]]'', which is the second installment of Falcom's long-running RPG series, ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]''. The title ''Faxanadu'' is a [[portmanteau]] formed from the names Famicom and ''Xanadu''.

The game uses side-scrolling and platforming game-play, while employing role-playing elements with an expansive story and medieval setting.

==Story==
The player-controlled [[protagonist]] of ''Faxanadu'' is an unnamed wanderer who returns home.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=The NES book: everything you need to know about Nintendo's iconic console; The master system: the Sega book|others=Jones, Darran,, Imagine Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781785460180|location=Bournemouth|page=51|oclc=909815695}}</ref> He has no name, though the Japanese version allows the player to choose one. The game begins when he approaches Eolis, his hometown, after an absence to find it in disrepair and virtually abandoned. Worse still, the town is under attack by Dwarves. The Elven king explains that the Elves' fountain water, their life source, has been stopped and all other remaining water has been poisoned and provides the protagonist with 1500 gold, the game's currency, to prepare for his journey to uncover the cause.

As the story unfolds, it is revealed that [[elf|Elves]] and [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarves]] lived in harmony among the [[World tree|World Tree]] until The Evil One emerged from a fallen [[meteorite]]. The Evil One then transformed the Dwarves into [[monster]]s against their will and set them against the Elves. The Dwarf King, Grieve, swallowed his magical sword before he was transformed, hiding it in his own body to prevent The Evil One from acquiring it. It is only with this sword that The Evil One can be destroyed.

His journey takes him to four [[overworld]] areas: the tree's buttress, the inside of the trunk, the tree's branches and finally the Dwarves' mountain stronghold.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Faxanadu NES gameplay.png|250px|thumb|right|A typical gameplay shot]]
''Faxanadu'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side scrolling]] [[Action role-playing game|action role playing game]],<ref name=":5" /> sometimes classified as a [[metroidvania]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Episode 111 resumes our exploratory journey into the metroidvania realm |url=http://retronauts.com/article/482/episode-111-resumes-our-exploratory-journey-into-the-metroidvania-realm |access-date=2022-12-31 |website=Retronauts |date=7 August 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Players guide the hero through a screen-by-screen series of fields, towns, and dungeons. The hero can walk, jump, and climb ladders – all typical characteristics of a [[platform game]]. Along the way, he may also purchase usable items with gold, equip and use bladed weapons against enemies, equip armor, and cast magic projectiles. In addition, he can access information regarding the game's events by speaking with townsfolk or by consulting other sources.

The limits of physical damage the hero can sustain from enemies is tracked by a [[life bar]], and the magical power he can exert is tracked by a [[magic point|magic bar]]. These are listed on the top of the screen along with total experience, total gold, time (for items with a timed duration), and the currently held item.

When the hero defeats an enemy, it usually leaves behind gold or life-giving bread. The hero also gains a set amount of experience. [[Experience points]] help increase the hero's rank. Occasionally, an enemy will also drop an item; some  activate specific effects when touched, while other items may be stored for later use.

The game utilizes a [[Password (video games)|password]] system. Passwords, or "[[mantras]]" as they are known in the game, can be obtained from church-dwelling [[Guru]]s. Gurus also bestow ranks to the hero when he meets certain experience totals; these determine the amounts of experience and gold a player will possess upon resuming a game via password.

Because of its use of statistics, reliance on story, thematic basis upon [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[fantasy]], and provision of interactive [[Non-player character|NPCs]], many observers have classified ''Faxanadu'' as a [[role-playing video game]].

==Development==
[[Jun Chikuma]] composed the music for the game and was assisted by Hudson Soft's sound programmer, Toshiaki Takimoto. Chikuma, working with just the tone generator of the NES which had only three channels, used her background in jazz technique to create melodic movements and express chord progression. The team gave her full freedom "from general directions to sound-making details. I was able to work quite freely under these good circumstances".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tieryas |first=Peter |date=2021-12-25 |title=The Unique Artist Behind Bomberman's Catchy Beats |url=https://kotaku.com/the-unique-artist-behind-bombermans-catchy-beats-1848268051 |access-date=2023-01-16 |website=Kotaku |language=en}}</ref>

The game world is featured in two episodes of Season 2 (1990–1991) of the Nintendo-based, Saturday morning cartoon series, ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''. They are "The Feud of Faxanadu" and "Germ Wars". The Elven King is named Melvis and looks and sounds like [[Elvis Presley]] for his first appearance; the voice was changed in the latter episode. The Dwarf King is not featured in the series; he is replaced by Queen Dwarfine.

The game was released on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2010 and 2011.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_fxd/ |title=Vc ファザナドゥ |access-date=2018-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814133628/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_fxd/ |archive-date=2014-08-14 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/OlLet3sroPTmTWkLNGd2jiBR7MYVITQ- |title=Nintendo - Official Site - Video Game Consoles, Games - Nintendo - Official Site |access-date=2018-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008134857/https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/OlLet3sroPTmTWkLNGd2jiBR7MYVITQ- |archive-date=2018-10-08 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Virtual-Console-Wii-/Faxanadu-277259.html|title = Faxanadu}}</ref>

The game has received critical acclaim. ''[[Weekly Famitsu]]'' scored it 29 out of 40.<ref name=":0" /> ''[[IGN]]'' reviewed the game in 2011, after its [[Wii virtual console]] release, giving it a better score of 8.5 out of 10 and called it a hidden gem. ''IGN'' went on to call it a better action RPG than ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'' and ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2011/02/26/faxanadu-review|title=Faxanadu Review - IGN|website=IGN|date=26 February 2011 |access-date=2015-12-31|archive-url=https://archive.today/20161027082041/http://ca.ign.com/articles/2011/02/26/faxanadu-review|archive-date=2016-10-27|url-status=live}}</ref>

Marcel van Duyn of [[Nintendo Life]] gave the game an 8 out of 10, saying that it is a surprisingly fun game and an absolutely essential purchase for those who like RPGs. However, he criticized the password system for western audiences, and was grateful the Virtual Console release eliminates that feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/faxanadu_virtual_console|title=Review: Faxanadu (Virtual Console / NES)|website=Nintendo Life|date=28 November 2010|access-date=2015-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082246/http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/faxanadu_virtual_console|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' listed the game as the 16th best game for the NES, saying it is a "forgotten gem" of the system's library.<ref name=":5" /> ''IGN'' listed the game as the 36th best NES game, calling it "one of the best and least-known Nintendo-published adventures.<ref>{{Citation|title=Top 100 NES Games - IGN.com|url=http://ca.ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games/36|language=en|access-date=2018-08-25|archive-date=2020-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201228050056/https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games/36|url-status=live}}</ref>
