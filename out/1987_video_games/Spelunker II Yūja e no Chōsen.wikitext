{{Nihongo|'''''Spelunker II: Yūja e no Chōsen'''''|スペランカーII {{Ruby-ja|勇者|ゆうじゃ}}への{{Ruby-ja|挑戦|ちょうせん}}||{{lit|Spelunker II: A Challenge for the Brave}}}} is a Japan-exclusive [[action game|action]] [[platformer]] video game released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in 1987.

Despite being titled as a sequel to [[Spelunker (video game)|''Spelunker'']], ''Spelunker II: Yūja e no Chōsen'' features vastly different gameplay.<ref>[http://www26.atwiki.jp/gcmatome/pages/608.html Comparison to ''Spelunker'' {{in lang|ja}}] at FC no Game Seiha Shimasho</ref> There was a separate arcade sequel, titled ''Spelunker II: 23 no Kagi'', which features similar gameplay to the first ''Spelunker'' game as well. The two ''Spelunker II'' games are separate entries in the series and are not related.

The word "Yūja" ({{lit|hero|brave one}}) in the title is often [[Romanization of Japanese|misromanized]] as "Yūsha"<ref name="mobygames"/><ref name="gamefaqs"/><ref name="hg101"/> – a more common reading of the same word – but the [[furigana]] featured on the box specifies that the former is correct.

==Gameplay==
[[File:SpelunkerIIClergyvsZombie.png|200px|left|thumb|The player dodges a fireball attack from a zombie.]]
Geyla took over Fairy Land in a massive demon invasion one thousand years ago and continues to rule it with an iron grip.<ref name="mobygames"/> A viewpoint similar to ''[[Legend of the Mystical Ninja|Ganbare Goemon]]'' is utilized, allowing players to go in four different directions.<ref name="giantbomb">[http://www.giantbomb.com/spelunker-ii-yuusha-e-no-chousen/61-20016/ Viewpoint/character information] at Giant Bomb</ref>

The player controls an anonymous treasure hunter who seeks treasure within Fairy Land. Unlike most video game characters, the player is an [[antihero]] who is unsure whether to liberate Fairy Land or simply become rich from all their treasures. Actions in the game will ultimately influence how the story ends. Lava fields along with bottomless pits and scattered enemies will make life tough for the player. There are also some [[boss (video gaming)|boss]]es that appear at the end of each respective stage.<ref name="mobygames"/>

Two distinct meters keep track of the character's well-being in the game; a "life" meter helps to govern the player's stamina while a "Toku" meter helps to govern the player's morality level. Killing undead creatures improves the player's "Toku" rating. Players can choose from three character classes: explorer, [[clergy]] or esper.<ref>[http://www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown/7197/SPE2_m.htm Advanced game information {{in lang|ja}}] at GeoCities.jp</ref> While the explorer is basically a variation from the original ''Spelunker'' character, the Esper is an adept magic user with the ability to throw thunderbolts while the clergy member can shoot out fireballs at the enemy.<ref name="giantbomb"/> The number of days that have elapsed in-game in addition to the current in-game time is included and is vital for certain tasks.<ref>[http://udontaro.blog79.fc2.com/blog-entry-114.html Additional game information {{in lang|ja}}] at Udontaro</ref> If the player falls down a pit while having a high "Toku" rating; he is revived at a minimum cost. Suffering that same fate with a low "Toku" meter causes the player to descend to eternal damnation in Hell, thus [[game over|ending the game]].<ref name="hg101">[http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/spelunker-ii/ ''Spelunker II: Yuusha e no Chōsen''] game information at Hardcore Gaming 101</ref>
