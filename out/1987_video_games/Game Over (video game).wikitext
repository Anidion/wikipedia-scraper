Controversy arose around the presence of a visible nipple on the advertising and inlay artwork, which had originally appeared on the cover of ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' (May 1984 - Vol. 8, No. 2) called ''Cover Ere Comprimee'' and is attributed to [[Luis Royo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-080/SinclairUser_080_Nov_1988#page/n49/mode/2up/ |title=Sinclair User Magazine Issue 080 |date= November 1988|access-date=2014-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonowt.com/magfold/articfol/boob.html |title=Nonowt eZine X - The Great 'Game Over' Boob |publisher=Nonowt.com |date= |access-date=2014-05-04}}</ref> [[Oliver Frey]], the art editor for ''Crash'' magazine, painted over the original bare-breasted image with a thin grey corset so that it could be printed, but retailers demanded that logos be placed over the nipple.<ref>''Edge'' 114, September 2002, "Box Clever" article on game packaging artwork.</ref> ''Game Over'' won the awards for best advert and best inlay of the year, according to the readers of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/51/awards.htm |title=CRASH 51 - Readers' Awards |publisher=Crashonline.org.uk |date= |access-date=2014-05-04}}</ref>
