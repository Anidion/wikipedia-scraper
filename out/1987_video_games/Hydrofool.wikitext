'''''Hydrofool''''' is an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game released by [[Faster Than Light (software publisher)|FTL]] in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Sweevo's World]]''. The game music was composed by [[Rob Hubbard]], with the title track based on [[Abe Holzmann]]'s "Blaze Away!"{{fact|date=October 2017}}

== Plot ==
The gigantic [[aquarium]] known as the "Deathbowl" has become so heavily polluted that the only remedy is to completely drain it by pulling out each of its four plugs. The robot Sweevo has been ordered to perform this task.

== Gameplay ==
Sweevo must swim through the caverns of the Deathbowl finding and pulling the plugs in the correct order. To pull a plug several puzzles must be solved using the objects that scatter the floor of the aquarium. The Deathbowl is populated by creatures which will try to stop Sweevo from carrying out his task.

The Deathbowl is constructed of several superimposed levels and Sweevo can travel between them by riding bubbles or diving into [[whirlpool]]s.

Sweevo begins to [[rust]] as soon as he enters the water and must complete his mission before he becomes incapacitated. Contact with dangerous creatures or structures will also cause rusting, while [[lubricating oil|oil cans]] will remove some rust from him.

''[[Sinclair User]]:'' "The graphics are superb - particularly if you like fish..."<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{Citation|title=Hydrofool Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=June 1987}}</ref>

''[[Your Sinclair]]:'' "All great fun. The graphics and sprites are all wonderfully clear and well thought out, and as usual with [[Gargoyle Games|Gargoyle]]/[[Faster Than Light (software publisher)|FTL]], the design's immaculate."<ref name="Your Sinclair Review">{{Citation|title=Hydrofool Review|newspaper=[[Your Sinclair]]|date=August 1987}}</ref>

''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]:'' "The feel of the game relies heavily on the high quality graphics - Sweevo really does seem to be swimming underwater. With the large number of screens, and the intricately woven [[Greg Follis]] puzzles, Hydrofool should hold {{sic|it's}} appeal for quite some time."<ref name="Crash Review">{{Citation|title=Hydrofool Review|newspaper=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]|date=June 1987}}</ref>
