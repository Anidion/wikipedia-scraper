Harvey Bernstein for ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' stated "Hardcore wargamers will probably find Breach's variations on old themes intriguing, but for the rest of us this ST game just isn't much fun."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/1988-03-anticmagazine|title=Antic Magazine Volume 6 Number 11 (Next Generation Game Machines)|date=March 9, 1988|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
