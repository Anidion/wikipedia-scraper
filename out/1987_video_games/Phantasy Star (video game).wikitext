{{nihongo foot|'''''Phantasy Star'''''|ファンタシースター|Fantashī Sutā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[role-playing video game]] (RPG) developed by [[Sega]] and released for the [[Master System]] in 1987. One of the earliest [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese RPGs]] for consoles, ''Phantasy Star'' tells the story of [[Alis Landale|Alis]] on her journey to defeat the evil ruler of her star system, King Lassic, after her brother dies at his hands. She traverses between planets, gathering a party of fighters and collecting the items she needs to avenge her brother's death and return peace to the star system. The gameplay features traditional Japanese RPG elements including [[random encounter]]s and [[experience point]]s. All the characters have predefined personalities and abilities, a unique element compared to the customizable characters of other RPGs of the era.

Sega launched the development of ''Phantasy Star'' so their Master System could compete with the burgeoning popularity of console RPGs, particularly ''[[Dragon Quest (video game)|Dragon Quest]]'' (1986) on the [[Famicom]]. Designer Kotaro Hayashida and programmer [[Yuji Naka]] formed a team, staffed by a large number of women for the time, including graphic designer [[Rieko Kodama]]. The team wanted ''Phantasy Star'' to be a unique RPG experience, so they added elements like 3D [[dungeon crawling]], a female protagonist, and ample animation. The game's setting was a fusion between [[medieval fantasy]] and [[science fiction]], an idea inspired by ''[[Star Wars]]''. The team had to use several techniques to fit all their content on a four [[megabit]] cartridge, a large game size for the time.

The game was released for the Master System two days after ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' arrived for the competing Famicom. It was praised for its grand sense of adventure due to its advanced visual effects and deep gameplay. The battery backup system drew praise but also contributed to the game's notably high retail price which made it difficult for some critics to recommend. The game was re-released on several platforms in the following years, including [[Phantasy Star Collection|a series of ''Phantasy Star'' compilations]]. In 2003, a [[Video game remake|remake]] titled {{nihongo foot|''Phantasy Star Generation 1''|ファンタシースター generation:1|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released for the [[PlayStation 2]].

''Phantasy Star'' is considered a landmark RPG for its use of predetermined characters and a [[science fantasy]] setting. Sega launched [[Phantasy Star|a series of sequels]], some of which were developed by staff who worked on the original. Kodama directed ''[[Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium]]'' (1993) and Naka produced ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' (2000).

==Gameplay==
[[File:PhantasyStarBattle2.png|thumb|left|Alis battles two "Owl Bear" enemies near the start of the game, although only one is rendered onscreen.]]

''Phantasy Star'' is a traditional [[Japanese role-playing game]].<ref name=":22" /> It alters between a [[top-down perspective]] when the player is exploring the overworld, and changes to a [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] view when engaged in battle or exploring dungeons.<ref name=":6" /> The dungeons are long and twisted, and require the player to map most of them on paper.<ref name=":5" /><ref name="egp" /> When exploring the overworld, the player can venture into a town to buy items and weapons.<ref name=":3" /> Outside the towns, monsters may randomly engage the player in battle.<ref name=":3" /> The player controls the main character [[Alis Landale|Alis]], and as the game progresses, other characters are recruited to her party: a wizard named Noah, a warrior Odin, and a talking cat-like creature named Myau.<ref name=":22" /> Each character has different strengths, weaknesses, and abilities.<ref name="egp" /> The party has a shared inventory of items and equipment.<ref name=":6" />

When encountering enemies, all party members enter into battle.<ref name=":6" /> Battles are handled using a menu system which allows the player to fight or attempt to talk and negotiate with an enemy.<ref name=":22" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":15" /> When an enemy is defeated, party members gain [[experience point]]s and are rewarded with a treasure chest that may contain money or a booby trap.<ref name=":6" /> As the characters gain experience points, they increase in level, gaining access to new magic spells and raising their offensive and defensive statistics.<ref name=":5" />

==Plot==
''Phantasy Star'' is set in the Algol star system which consists of three planets: the lush and green Palma, the arid and barren Motavia, and the icy and desolate Dezoris. Algol is ruled by King Lassic, who while originally benevolent, becomes a cruel, sociopathic tyrant. After a string of harsh political changes, small pockets of rebellion emerge but are mostly ineffective against Lassic's iron rule. One such rebel named Nero is killed by Lassic's forces, and his sister Alis swears revenge. Alis builds a party of adventurers including a warrior named Odin,{{Efn|Odin is named Tyrone in the Japanese version}} a wizard named Noah,{{Efn|Noah is named Lutz in the Japanese version and later English games}} and a catlike creature named Myau. Together, they embark on an adventure spanning the three planets, meeting with townspeople, battling enemies, and finding special items that will help in the fight against Lassic. Eventually, the party engages and defeats Lassic, after which an ethereal voice tells them to return to Motavia. There, they encounter a more evil force, Dark Falz, and after destroying him, finally return peace to the Algol system.

The team consisted of around ten people.<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2018/09/29/phantasy-stars-main-designer-talks-about-what-went-into-the-making-of-the-game/|title=Phantasy Star's Main Designer Talks About What Went Into The Making Of The Game|last=Wong|first=Alistair|date=September 29, 2018|website=Siliconera|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215070037/http://www.siliconera.com/2018/09/29/phantasy-stars-main-designer-talks-about-what-went-into-the-making-of-the-game/|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=December 11, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Hayashida was lead designer and Naka was lead programmer.<ref name="untold2" /><ref name=":1" /> Other staff members from ''Miracle World'' joined the project including lead graphic designer [[Rieko Kodama]], and composer Tokuhiko Uwabo.<ref name=":1" /> There were more women on the development team than was typical at the time.<ref name=":4" /> Among them were Kodama, who drew most of the artwork,<ref name=":2" /> designer Miki Morimoto, who did much of the [[playtesting]] and enemy statistics configuration,<ref name=":4" /> and Chieko Aoki, who wrote the game's original story and script.<ref name=":4" /> Aoki had already been working on an original story with most of the dialogue already completed, and this became the first draft for the RPG project.<ref name=":4" /> The game would be character designer [[Naoto Ohshima]]'s first project at Sega.<ref name="untold" /> Although there was no team director,<ref name="untold">{{Cite book|title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers Vol. 3|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|publisher=SMG Szczepaniak|year=2018|pages=297–299|chapter=Ohshima, Naoto}}</ref> Hayashida believes he had the largest role in shaping the game as lead designer and scenario writer,<ref name="untold2">{{Cite book|title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers Vol. 3|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|publisher=SMG Szczepaniak|year=2018|pages=325–330|chapter=Hayashida, Kotaro}}</ref> although Ohshima recalls Naka leading the project.<ref name="untold" /> The name "Phantasy Star" was formed after Naka took the word "Fantasy" from a song he enjoyed titled "Nagisa no Fantasy" by [[Noriko Sakai]].<ref name=":4" /> The team shared the same room, so they could see each other's work.<ref name=":4" /> They were given the freedom to build the game how they wanted without restrictions, which Hayashida believes led to them enjoying themselves more and producing a higher quality game in the end.<ref name=":4" />

===Production===
The team wanted ''Phantasy Star'' to be different from other RPGs. They took many new approaches to the design of the game and its art to provide a unique experience.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-nextlevel.com/feature/interview-rieko-kodama|title=Interview: Rieko Kodama Feature|last1=Ali Almaci|first1=Hasan|last2=Kemps|first2=Heidi|date=December 13, 2004|website=The Next Level|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916010555/http://www.the-nextlevel.com/feature/interview-rieko-kodama|archive-date=September 16, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> One approach was with the setting. The team was strongly influenced by ''[[Star Wars]]'' and how it combined Western culture with Japanese touches, such as how clothing resembled [[judo]] uniforms, and [[lightsaber]]s were used like [[Katana|samurai swords]].<ref name="untold2" /><ref name=":2" /> Kodama took this approach and designed the world of ''Phantasy Star'' using a [[science fiction]] motif mixed with [[medieval fantasy]] elements.<ref name=":2" /> Rather than use an [[airship]] to navigate over mountainous landscape, something common in other games, they added in a vehicle that could mow down impassable terrain.<ref name=":4" /> The team also added detailed event scenes, and animated monsters to help set the game apart.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> Their philosophy was to use extensive animation, so the ocean and walkways on the world map are always moving.<ref name=":2" /> Because the Master System could not draw large [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], some parts of large characters were drawn to the background and only the animated portions were drawn as sprites.<ref name="untold2" />

[[File:Phantasy Star dungeon.gif|thumb|left|Navigating a 3D dungeon in ''Phantasy Star'']]
Another unique addition to ''Phantasy Star'' was the 3D dungeons.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" /> They became a central concept in the game's early planning stages,<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> in part because the Famicom was incapable of handling them.<ref name=":4" /> The team drew inspiration from Western [[dungeon crawl]]ing RPGs like ''Wizardry'' and wanted to add animated navigation to help the player know their location and orientation more easily.<ref name="untold2" /> Naka had experimented with creating dungeons inspired by these RPGs. Typically these scenes were rendered in small boxes, so Naka was motivated to engineer a full-screen dungeon that could be used for an action game or an RPG.<ref name=":1" /> Originally the artists were drawing full 2D backgrounds using a 3D perspective, but the number of frames necessary to achieve the animated effect used too much space on the cartridge.<ref name=":2" /> Naka solved this by programming true [[Wire-frame model|wireframe]] 3D dungeons.<ref name=":2" /> The artists then used a program by Naka to superimpose their art on top of the wireframes.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /> They also saved three-quarters of the memory they would normally need by making each quadrant of the screen identical.<ref name="untold2" /> The new dungeons scrolled faster than expected and needed to be slowed down.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" />

The female heroine, Alis, was a sharp contrast compared with the typical male protagonists of other RPGs.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" /> Kodama had designed female characters before but never one in a strong and prominent role. This was an uncommon portrayal when games at the time usually had a [[damsel in distress]].<ref name=":13">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2017/12/behind-the-design-phantasy-star/|title=Behind the Design: Phantasy Star|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|date=December 6, 2017|website=Sega-16|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322015531/http://www.sega-16.com/2017/12/behind-the-design-phantasy-star/|archive-date=March 22, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=December 15, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Kodama went through about a dozen designs until she achieved a strong but feminine character, one with whom female gamers could empathize.<ref name="untold3" /><ref name=":13" /> Noah was also designed by Kodama, as a mysterious and intelligent character.<ref name="untold3" /> In the original draft, Noah was an androgynous character and would become male or female depending on how the player progressed. Eventually, it was decided the character would be male.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /> Ohshima designed Odin because Kodama did not enjoy drawing muscular men.<ref name=":2" /><ref name="untold" /> Kodama envisioned the visual contrast between Noah and Odin as comparable to that between [[Raistlin Majere]] and [[Caramon Majere]] in the ''[[Dragonlance]]'' book series.<ref name="untold3" /> Ohshima was also responsible for a third of the monster designs, at most.<ref name="untold" /> The lead monster designer enjoyed classic fantasy monsters such as [[golem]]s and [[Medusa]], so these types of characters appeared in the final game.<ref name=":2" /> Myau was designed by Takako Kawaguchi.<ref name=":2" />

At four [[megabit]]s, the game's data was large for the time.<ref name=":4" /> ''Phantasy Star'' was only the second game for the Master System to use a chip this large. It was one of four games where it would be used.{{Efn|''Phantasy Star'' was the second game following ''[[After Burner]]'' to use a 4M cartridge.<ref name=":1" /> The other two games where it was used later were ''[[SpellCaster (video game)|SpellCaster]]'' and ''[[R-Type]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=ストーリー・作品解説 |url=https://sega.jp/fb/album/07_ps/story.html |website=Sega |access-date=December 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407063202/http://sega.jp/fb/album/07_ps/story.html |archive-date=April 7, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}} In spite of the chip's capacity, the team made many compromises to save space.<ref name=":4" /> The original story featured four planets, but this was reduced to three.<ref name=":4" /> The artists had to make compromises with the backgrounds and battle animations.<ref name=":2" /> Background scenes were mirrored vertically to save space. This created inconsistencies with shadowing.<ref name=":2" /> There were plans for a password system to save progress, but this was cut due to memory limitations; batteries were used instead.<ref name=":4" /> The team wanted to have a password feature as a [[failsafe]] in case saving the data corrupted it as was often the case in [[playtests]]. Instead, Naka programmed a backup of the save data that could be used to restore a corrupted save file.<ref name=":1" />

Composer Uwabo noted that the game was developed during the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese economic bubble]], which fueled his enthusiasm which he believes is reflected in the music.<ref name="music">{{cite book|title=Phantasy Star 1st Series Complete Album ''liner notes''|date=2008|publisher=Wave Master}} ([http://shmuplations.com/phantasystarmusic/ Translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214065935/http://shmuplations.com/phantasystarmusic/ |date=December 14, 2018 }})</ref> The game was compatible with the Master System [[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesis]] expansion unit which housed a [[Yamaha YM2413]] chip that added nine more mono channels to the console's [[programmable sound generator]] (PSG), the [[Texas Instruments SN76489|SN76489]]. The expansion gave the soundtrack a wider range and heavier bass. The unit was not released outside Japan.<ref name=":13" />

==Release==
[[File:Sega Mark III.jpg|thumb|right|''Phantasy Star'' was originally released on the [[Master System]] (Japanese Mark III model pictured).]]
''Phantasy Star'' was first released in Japan for the Master System on December 20, 1987, two days after ''Final Fantasy'' was released for the Famicom.<ref name=":1" /> The game was released in the West in November 1988, introducing players outside Japan to the emerging JRPG scene, having been localized before ''Dragon Quest'' or ''Final Fantasy''.<ref name=":1" /> It was the most expensive game for the Master System in every market, its price being driven by the large 4 megabit chip, the save battery, and a concurrent chip shortage across the industry.<ref name=":1" /> In Japan, the game was difficult to find in stores.<ref name=":4" /> Sega often got requests from fans for a [[Mega Drive]] port,<ref name=":4" /> so they eventually shipped a limited release for the Mega Drive as part of a contest in 1994 under the title ''Phantasy Star Fukkokuban'' exclusively released in Japan.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Gaming Gossip|date=December 1993|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=Sendai Publishing|issue=53|page=64}}</ref><ref name=":19">{{cite magazine|date=April 1994|title=BEメガドッグレース|magazine=[[Gemaga|Beep! Mega Drive]]|language=ja|page=18}}</ref> This version was identical to the Master System version but lacked FM sound enhancements.<ref name=":19" /> [[Tectoy]] translated the Master System version to Portuguese and released it in Brazil in 1991.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Shots: Made in Brazil|magazine=[[Ação Games]]|language=pt|issue=1|pages=8}}</ref> Since the original Western release retained the text formatting of the Japanese version, it used fewer characters than a proper English translation required. In 2008, fans modified the text engine to fit longer lines of dialogue, and released a newly translated version with the Japanese FM soundtrack as well.<ref name=":1" />

[[Phantasy Star Collection|A series of ''Phantasy Star'' compilations]] were released for the [[Sega Saturn]], [[Game Boy Advance]], and [[PlayStation 2]].<ref name=":1" /> The Saturn version was released in 1998. It includes both [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] alphabets, an improvement from the original which had only katakana due to limited memory.<ref name=":21" /> The 2008 PlayStation 2 version is based on the Saturn version and has additional features.<ref name=":21" /> The Game Boy Advance compilation was a straight emulation and was the only compilation released outside Japan.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":16" /> ''Phantasy Star'' also appeared in emulated form on ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]],<ref name=":1" /> and on the [[Wii]] via the [[Virtual Console]] in 2009.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/phantasy_star|title=Phantasy Star|website=[[Nintendo Life]]|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331122443/http://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/phantasy_star|archive-date=March 31, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=December 12, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2018, a port developed by [[M2 (game developer)|M2]] was released through the ''[[Sega Ages]]'' label for the [[Nintendo Switch]].<ref name=":21">{{Cite web|url=https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1150731.html|title=「SEGA AGES ファンタシースター」インタビュー|last=山村智美|date=October 31, 2018|website=GAME Watch|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215122119/https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1150731.html|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=December 12, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/phantasy_star_joins_the_sega_ages_line_on_switch_today|title=Phantasy Star Joins The Sega AGES Line On Switch Today|last=Craddock|first=Ryan|date=December 13, 2018|website=Nintendo Life|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215123007/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/phantasy_star_joins_the_sega_ages_line_on_switch_today|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=December 15, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=":20" /> This version includes enhancements such as options to make the game easier and faster, guides for items, spells, and monsters, the FM soundtrack, hiragana support, and a dungeon auto-mapping feature.<ref name=":21" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.sega.jp/segaages/ps/|title=SEGA AGES ファンタシースター|date=2018|website=Sega Ages|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020115801/http://archives.sega.jp/segaages/ps/|archive-date=October 20, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=December 15, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Naka's tricky programming efficiencies to save memory in the original proved difficult for the programmers handling the port.<ref name=":20" /><ref name=":21" />

''Phantasy Star'' was well received.

Critics praised the game for its presentation, building a grand sense of adventure and atmosphere.<ref name="egp" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" /> ''VideoGames & Computer Entertainment'' commended the mix of science fiction and fantasy elements, and felt it had a grander scale than other RPGs.<ref name=":5" /> ''Electronic Game Player'' wrote that the atmosphere was "simply breathtaking by current video game standards".<ref name="egp" /> The graphics were enjoyed by many reviewers, especially for their vivid colors and animation;<ref name="egp" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":8" /> the monster animations, in particular, received considerable positive attention.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":3">{{cite magazine|last=Glancey|first=Paul|title=Mean Machines: Phantasy Star|magazine=Computer and Video Games|issue=89|date=March 1989|pages=93}}</ref> Many reviewers enjoyed the dungeons, thinking the lighting and perspective effects made for a realistic presentation.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":10" /> ''Electronic Game Player'' called ''Phantasy Star'' a "visual tour-de-force" and "so technologically superior in graphics, that the Nintendo titles pale by comparison".<ref name="egp" /> ''Zzap!'' called it a technical achievement considering the Master System's hardware limitations.<ref name=":8" /> It was awarded Best Graphics for 1988 by ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s Player's Choice Awards.<ref name=":9">{{cite magazine|date=1989|title=The 1989 "Player's Choice Awards"|magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly 1989 Buyer's Guide|pages=19}}</ref>

The game was difficult to recommend for some because of its high price.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":10" /> ''Computer Entertainer'' found the purchase difficult to justify as it was the highest price they had ever seen for a game on any cartridge-based system or disk-based computer.<ref name=":10" /> ''Computer and Video Games'' felt they could only recommend it for hardcore RPG fans for this reason.<ref name=":3" /> ''VideoGames & Computer Entertainment'', however, called it "such a remarkable video game that it may justify its existence as the most expensive cartridge on the shelf."<ref name=":5" />
