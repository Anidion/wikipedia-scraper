'''''The Train: Escape to Normandy''''' is a [[video game]] released by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] in 1987 and themed loosely on the motion picture ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'', starring [[Burt Lancaster]].  In the video game, the player assumes the role of a train hijacker who has commandeered a [[steam train]] to escape [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. When the train is in motion the player must maintain the correct speed, steam pressure and other operational parameters of the train; also, the player must attempt to shoot down Nazi [[fighter plane]]s which occasionally strafe the train by aiming and firing [[anti-aircraft gun]]s mounted to the engine of the train. When the train occasionally stops briefly for resupply at various train stations, the player also must provide cover fire against attackers in the station buildings for comrades resupplying the train.

''The Train'' was initially released for several [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] [[home computer|computer]] platforms, including the [[Commodore 64]]. The game was also later released on [[IBM PC]].
