'''''MIDI Maze''''', also known as '''''Faceball 2000''''', is a networked [[first-person shooter]] [[maze game]] for the [[Atari ST]] developed by Xanth Software F/X and released in 1987 by Hybrid Arts. The game takes place in a maze of untextured walls. The world animates smoothly as the player turns, much like the earlier ''[[Wayout]]'', instead of only permitting 90 degree changes of direction. Using the [[MIDI]] ports on the Atari ST, the game is said to have introduced [[Deathmatch (video games)|deathmatch]] combat to gaming in 1987.  It also predated the [[LAN party]] concept by several years. The game found a wider audience when it was converted to ''Faceball 2000'' on the [[Game Boy]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:ST Midi Maze.png|thumb|Atari ST gameplay]]
Up to 16 computers can be networked in a "MIDI Ring" by [[Network_topology#Daisy_chain|daisy chaining]] MIDI ports that are built into the Atari ST series.

The game area occupies only roughly a quarter of the screen and consists of a [[First person (video games)|first-person view]] of a flat-shaded maze with a crosshair in the middle. All players are shown as ''Pac-Man''-like [[smiley]] [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] in various colors.<ref>{{cite web|title=25 years of Pac-Man|publisher=MeriStation|date=July 4, 2005|url=http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_articulo.php?pic=DC&id=cw42b7458f0dfc7&idj=&idp=&tipo=art&c=1&pos=7|access-date=2011-05-06|archive-date=2011-09-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929150234/http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_articulo.php?pic=DC&id=cw42b7458f0dfc7&idj=&idp=&tipo=art&c=1&pos=7|url-status=dead}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meristation.com%2Fv3%2Fdes_articulo.php%3Fpic%3DDC%26id%3Dcw42b7458f0dfc7%26idj%3D%26idp%3D%26tipo%3Dart%26c%3D1%26pos%3D7&sl=es&tl=en&hl=&ie=UTF-8 Translation])</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-5|title=Gaming's Most Important Evolutions|page=5|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=October 8, 2010|access-date=2011-04-27}}</ref> Bullets are represented as small spheres.

The game is started by a designated master machine, which sets rules, divides players into teams, and selects a maze. A number of mazes come with the game, and additional mazes can be constructed using a text-editor.

==Development==
The original ''MIDI Maze'' team at Xanth Software F/X consisted of James Yee as the business manager, Michael Park as the graphic and networking programmer, and George Miller writing the AI and drone logic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

==Ports==
A [[Game Boy]] version was developed by Xanth, and published in 1991 by [[Blue Planet Software|Bullet-Proof Software]], with the title ''Faceball 2000''.<ref>Schiffmann, William. "In your Face! New toy will wow Game Boy owners." Chicago Sun-Times. 1992-05-22. Retrieved 2012-10-21 via HighBeam Research [https://web.archive.org/web/20140611135346/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4111554.html URL].</ref> James Yee, owner of Xanth, had the idea of porting the 520ST application to the Game Boy. George Miller was hired to rewrite the AI-based drone logic, giving each drone a unique personality trait.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} This version allows two players with a [[Game Link Cable]], or up to four players with the Four Player Adapter.

It is often rumored that the Game Boy version would allow up to 16 players by daisy-chaining Four Player Adapters, which is not the case. According to programmer Robert Champagne, the game does contain a 16-player mode; however, it requires a special connector that would be bundled with the game, to create a "chain" of Game Link Cables. As Nintendo did not allow them to do so, that connector was never released, so the 16-player mode cannot be enabled using Game Boy systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Komarechka |first1=Don |title=Interview with Robert Champagne |url=http://fb2k.retro-spect.ca/rchampagne.html |website=Faceball 2000 GB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509163809/http://fb2k.retro-spect.ca/rchampagne.html |access-date=22 November 2020|archive-date=2010-05-09 }}</ref> However, a method exists for players to daisy chain Game Boy Advance link cables, where each purple end connects to the hub of another cable and the gray ends connecting to a Game Boy Advance, to allow up to 15 players.<ref>{{cite web |title=Faceball 2000 - The 3D First Person Shooter for the original Game Boy that supported 16 players! |url=https://redd.it/x6y87z |website=Reddit |access-date=6 September 2022 }}</ref>

A [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] version, also titled ''Faceball 2000'', was released in 1992, supporting two players in split-screen mode. This version features completely different graphics and levels from the earlier Game Boy version. A variety of in-game music for this version was composed by [[George Sanger (musician)|George "The Fat Man" Sanger]].<ref>{{Citation |title=City Zone - Faceball 2000 (SNES Music) By George Sanger |url=https://soundcloud.com/slugsnail/city-zone-faceball-2000-snes-music-by-george-sanger |language=en |access-date=2022-06-03}}</ref>

A [[Game Gear]] version, also titled ''Faceball 2000'', was released to the [[Japan]]ese market by [[Riverhillsoft|Riverhill Soft]].<ref>Komarechka, Don.

Electric Pickle Online. 2006-03-19. Retrieved 2012-10-21.</ref> It is a colorized version of the monochrome Game Boy version, supporting two players with two handheld consoles connected by the Gear-to-Gear Cable.

A [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD/CD-ROM²|PC-Engine CD-ROM]] version, titled only ''Faceball'' (フェイスボール), was released in Japan by Riverhill Soft.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Unreleased ports===
A port of ''MIDI Maze'' for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was developed by Xanth, but cancelled circa 1989. A prototype was eventually found and the ROM was released.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reichert |first=Matt |title=MIDI Maze |website=AtariProtos.com |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/8bit/software/midimaze/midimaze.htm |access-date = 2007-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-midi-maze_3380.html |website=Atari Mania |access-date=12 December 2020|title=Atari 400 800 XL XE MIDI Maze : Scans, dump, download, screenshots, ads, videos, catalog, instructions, roms }}</ref>

According to Robert Champagne, other unreleased ports were worked on at Xanth, including IBM PC and NES.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Komarechka |first1=Don |title=Interview with Robert Champagne |url=http://fb2k.retro-spect.ca/rchampagne.html |website=Faceball 2000 GB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509163809/http://fb2k.retro-spect.ca/rchampagne.html |access-date=22 November 2020|archive-date=2010-05-09 }}</ref>

A port for Nintendo's [[Virtual Boy]] console, to be titled ''NikoChan Battle'' (ニコちゃんバトル) in Japan, was almost completed, but canceled as the system was discontinued in late 1995.<ref>{{cite web |title=NikoChan Battle for Virtual Boy |url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/virtualboy/189285-nikochan-battle |website=GameFAQs |access-date=22 November 2020}}</ref> A prototype was found in 2013, and the ROM was subsequently released.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Suszek |first1=Mike |title=Lost Virtual Boy game NikoChan Battle found and being re-released |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013-01-06-lost-virtual-boy-game-nikochan-battle-found-and-being-re-release.html |website=Engadget |access-date=22 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Niko-Chan Battle (Prototype) |url=https://hiddenpalace.org/Niko-Chan_Battle_%28Prototype%29 |website=Hidden Palace |access-date=22 November 2020}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' picked ''Faceball 2000'' as the #5 greatest game available in 1991, saying: "The Game Boy meets virtual reality (i.e., artificial, computer-enhanced, first-person perspective). In ''Faceball 2000'', you assume the identity of a Holographically Assisted Physical Pattern Yielded for Active Computerized Embarkation — or HAPPYFACE — and hunt down your opponents. You can play alone or link up with as many as three additional players. More fun than real-life tag, and much more stimulating."<ref>[https://ew.com/article/1991/11/22/video-games-guide/ Video Games Guide],  Bob Strauss, November 22, 1991, EW.com</ref> [[CNET|CNET Gamecenter]] called ''MIDI Maze'' one of the 10 most innovative computer games of all time.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000615070900/http://www.gamecenter.com/Features/Exclusives/Hallofgame/ss04.html Features - The Hall of Game Innovation], GAMECENTER.COM, ''...Midi Maze...Hybrid Arts...Derivatives: Doom and its countless clones...''</ref> In 2018, [[Den of Geek]] ranked the game 25th on their "25 Underrated Game Boy Games."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Freiburg|first=Chris|date=2018-08-27|title=25 Underrated Game Boy Games|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/games/25-underrated-game-boy-games/|access-date=2022-01-09|website=Den of Geek|language=en-US}}</ref>
