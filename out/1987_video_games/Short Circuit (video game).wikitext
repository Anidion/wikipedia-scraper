'''''Short Circuit''''' is a video game based on the 1986 [[Short Circuit (1986 film)|film of the same name]]. It was developed and published by British company [[Ocean Software]], and was released in Europe in 1987, for [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] (C64), and [[ZX Spectrum]].<ref name=CVG1/><ref name=Dator/><ref name=Happy/> It was published again in 1989 as a budget re-release.<ref name=CU/><ref name=CVG3/>

==Gameplay==
''Short Circuit'' is based on the [[Short Circuit (1986 film)|film of the same name]], in which a weaponized robot, Number 5, is struck by lightning and gains human emotion. The president of Number 5's manufacturing company - NOVA Robotics wants to capture him before he can do any harm to the public, and the scientist who built Number 5 wants to disassemble him and discover how he gained emotion. Meanwhile, a security chief wants to destroy Number 5.<ref name=CVG2/>

''Short Circuit'' consists of two gameplay modes, both in which the player takes control of Number 5. In the first portion, Number 5 must wander through numerous rooms in the robotics facility and try to escape. From computers, the player downloads software that allows Number 5 to jump, shoot a laser to stun guards, and search for items that must be used to escape. The player must also locate instructions for how to build a decoy robot later in the game.<ref name=CVG1/><ref name=ACAR/><ref name=CG/><ref name=SU/><ref name=ZXC/>

The second portion is a [[side-scrolling game]] in which Number 5 must evade security guards and other robots while running through country land. Animals are encountered on Number 5's path, and he must avoid running into them. Otherwise, he feels remorse for harming the wildlife and will eventually shut himself down if it occurs often enough. Likewise, the player must be careful not to kill the guards with Number 5's laser. The player wins the game by reaching a van and building the decoy robot.<ref name=CVG1/><ref name=ACAR/><ref name=CG/><ref name=SU/><ref name=ZXC>{{cite magazine |date=May 1987 |title=Short Circuit |magazine=ZX Computing |location=United Kingdom |pages=10â€“11}}</ref>

''Short Circuit'' was praised for its graphics,<ref name=ACAR/><ref name=CVG1/><ref name=CVG2/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=SU/> and its music and sound.<ref name=CUser/><ref name=CVG2/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=Z64/> J. Mark Hunter of ''The Australian Commodore Review'' stated that the Number 5 character "is identical to the movie representation and moves exactly the same way", while writing that the music "harmonizes perfectly with the excellent movability of the robot along a very fine graphic scroll-scape". Hunter concluded that the game was "definitely a pleasurable investment, and one that you won't get sick of for a long, long time".<ref name=ACAR/> Lee Brathwaite of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' (''CVG'') wrote that the Number 5 character "has been captured in every detail", while the background graphics "are good and suit the game well".<ref name=CVG2>{{cite magazine |last=Brathwaite |first=Lee |date=June 1987 |title=Short Circuit (C64) |magazine=Computer and Video Games |location=United Kingdom |pages=14, 40}}</ref>

Reviewers for ''[[Zzap!64]]'' found it to be a repetitive and average film-based game,<ref name=Z64/> while Jim Douglas of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' called it a "very worthwhile purchase".<ref name=SU/> Douglas praised the gameplay and its variety, but preferred the second stage, calling the first one difficult.<ref name=SU/> Gwyn Hughes of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' was disappointed with the second stage, calling it "a shallow let down after that superb first part".<ref name=YS/> Paul Boughton, also writing for ''CVG'', praised the gameplay and considered it clever.<ref name=CVG1>{{cite magazine |last=Boughton |first=Paul |date=April 1987 |title=Short Circuit (C64/Amstrad CPC) |magazine=Computer and Video Games |location=United Kingdom |pages=14, 30}}</ref>

''CVG'' reviewed the game's re-release in 1989. The magazine called the first stage "reasonably addictive" but commented that the second stage "is much too difficult, requiring absolutely precise timing to avoid the many animals which get in your way". ''CVG'' stated that the ZX Spectrum version offered crisper graphics than the Amstrad CPC version.<ref name=CVG3/>
