'''''Evening Star''''' is a [[vector graphics]] train simulation game for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Acorn Electron]], and [[Amstrad CPC]] published by [[Hewson Consultants]] in 1987. It is the [[sequel]] to ''[[Southern Belle (video game)|Southern Belle]]''.

==Gameplay==
The idea of the game is to successfully get the "Evening Star" from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to its destination [[Bournemouth]] on the old [[Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway|Somerset and Dorset line]]. The objectives are keeping to the tight timetable, earning points for safety and economy, and obeying signals. Stops are made at stations along the route to pick up passengers.

''Evening Star'' received positive reviews from critics. Bob Hillyer of ''The Games Machine'' praised the game's "fine-tuned" improvements on its predecessor, ''[[Southern Belle (video game)|Southern Belle]]'', citing its longer track and better graphics display.<ref name=TGM>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Games Machine|issue=1|title=West Country Express: Evening Star|last=Hillyer|first=Bob|pages=132â€“33|date=October 1987|url=https://archive.org/details/thegamesmachine-01/page/n53}}</ref> ''Computer & Video Games'' found the game's merits and flaws to be largely identical to ''[[Southern Belle (video game)|Southern Belle]]'', but highlighted the game's hazards, including the potential for derailment and collisions.<ref name=CVG/> ''Your Sinclair Magazine'' commended the game's attention to detail in its recreation of the rail line and the range of gameplay options and engine controls, but noted the game was "less than startling" in its monochrome graphical presentation.<ref name=YS/>
