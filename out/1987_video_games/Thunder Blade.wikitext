[[File:ARC Thunder Blade.png|thumb|left|Arcade version]]
The player controls a helicopter gunship using its chain gun and missiles to destroy enemy tanks, helicopters, and other vehicles and structures, to save their home country. Each level is in either a top-down or [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] perspective view. The [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] levels are in the top-down view.

The player is given 2 "lives" as continues, used if they are killed in a level. Clearing a level allows you to return, bypassing the levels before it.

The 3D classic release allows joystick emulation and gyroscopic controls.

==Development==
The plot and setting were inspired by the 1983 film ''[[Blue Thunder]]'',<ref name="TGM15"/> from which a [[digitized]] frame became the [[title screen]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Thunder Blade |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/thunder-blade/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=July 28, 2017 |access-date=May 4, 2021}}</ref>
