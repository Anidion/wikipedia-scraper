'''''Team Yankee''''' is a 1990 [[real-time strategy]] [[Simulation video game|simulation]] [[computer wargame]] developed by Oxford Digital Enterprises and published by [[Empire Software]] for [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[Commodore CDTV]]. Based on [[Harold Coyle]]'s [[Team Yankee|novel]] and [[Team Yankee (board game)|board game]] of the same name, the game depicts a [[World War III]] scenario between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] from an [[armoured warfare]] perspective.

Gameplay is conducted both from a map of the area and in a 3D environment with 2D sprites. The game features numerous iconic [[Cold War]]-era [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s, including the [[M1 Abrams]], [[M2 Bradley]], [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]], [[T-62]], [[T-72]], and [[BMP-2]], among others.

''Team Yankee'' was released to somewhat negative reception from critics for its "arcade-like" gameplay and its lack of [[infantry]] or [[military aircraft]]. The game received two sequels, ''[[Pacific Islands (video game)|Pacific Islands]]'' in 1992 and ''[[War in the Gulf]]'' in 1993.

==Reception==
1992 and 1994 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' surveys of wargames with modern settings gave the game two stars out of five, describing it as "an arcade-like product trying to pass as a simulation of modern tactical armored warfare".<ref name="brooks199206">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

The magazine concluded that it, while more realistic than ''Pacific Islands'', was not for "the hard-core wargamer, but are for people who enjoy a quick and relatively easy run-through of a tank game".<ref name="savage199212">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=101 | title=Empire's Team Yankee & Pacific Islands | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1992 | accessdate=5 July 2014 | author=Savage, Richard | pages=172}}</ref>
