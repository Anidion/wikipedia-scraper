'''''Exolon''''' is a [[run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] game programmed by [[Raffaele Cecco]] and published by [[Hewson Consultants|Hewson]] in 1987 for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Amstrad CPC]]. It was later converted to the [[Enterprise (computer)|Enterprise 128]], [[Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]].

==Gameplay==

The player takes control of a futuristic soldier named Vitorc<ref name='crash55cecco'>{{cite magazine |title=Cecco's Log|magazine=Crash|issue=55|publisher=Newsfield|date=August 1988|page=48-49|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=1022&page=48|access-date=24 February 2023}}</ref> across several [[flip-screen]] levels of gameplay. The screens that make up these levels are filled with various generic aliens as well as gun emplacements, homing missiles, landmines and other hazards. The soldier can defend himself with both a gun and rocket-propelled [[grenade]]s. The two different weapons are effective against different enemies.

The enemies themselves are varied, taking the forms of flying aliens of the type traditionally found in shoot 'em up games as well as homing missiles, fixed guns, tanks, [[land mine]]s, swarming red pods and "crushers" which shoot out of the ground.

Partway through each level, there is a pod in which the player can "upgrade" until the end of the current level to an armoured [[exoskeleton]] with improved weapons and armour. Completing the level without this upgrade results in a score bonus.

==Legacy==
After developing the two ''[[Cybernoid]]'' titles in 1988, Cecco's next game was ''[[Stormlord]]''.
