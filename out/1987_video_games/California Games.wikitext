'''''California Games''''' is a 1987 [[sports video game]] originally released by [[Epyx]] for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]], and ported to other [[home computer]]s and [[video game console]]s. Branching from their ''[[Summer Games (video game)|Summer Games]]'' and ''[[Winter Games]]'' series, this game consists of a collection of outdoor sports purportedly popular in [[California]]. The game was successful and spawned a sequel, ''[[California Games II]]''.

* [[Half-pipe]]

==Development==
Several members of the development team moved on to other projects. Chuck Sommerville, the designer of the half-pipe game in ''California Games'', later developed the game ''[[Chip's Challenge]]'', while [[Ken Nicholson]], the designer of the [[footbag]] game, was the inventor of the technology used in Microsoft's [[DirectX]]. Kevin Norman, the designer of the [[BMX]] game, went on to found the educational science software company Norman & Globus, makers of the ''ElectroWiz'' series of products.

The sound design for the original version of ''California Games'' was done by Chris Grigg, member of the band [[Negativland]].{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

==Ports==
Originally written for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]], it was eventually [[Porting|ported]] to [[Amiga]], [[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari ST]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[MSX]] and [[Master System]]. The [[Atari Lynx]] version was the [[pack-in game]] for the system when it was launched in June 1989. An Atari XE version was planned and contracted out by Atari Corp. to Epyx in 1988 but no code was delivered by the publication deadline.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10221846349820667|title=November 30, 1998 ATARI Corp.

In 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' listed the "Games" series collectively as number 89 on its "Top 100 Games of All Time".

==Legacy==
The game was followed in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]] by ''[[California Games II]]'', but the sequel failed to match the original's success.

A ''California Games'' television series was considered in the late 1980s as part of the ''Super Mario Bros. Power Hour'', a one-hour animation block of Nintendo focused video game adaptations. Concept art was produced for the project by [[DIC Animation City]]. Only the Mario and Zelda segments for the block were ultimately produced, airing in 1989 as part of ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/8/18536769/super-mario-bros-power-hour-metroid-castlevania-cartoons-dic|title=The Super Mario Bros.

The game was released for [[mobile phones]] in the Java format, and current rights holders [[System 3 (software company)|System 3]] CEO Mark Cale has stated that the game will be available in future as both a retail product and an online product for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gonintendo.com/?p=18211 |title=Blog Archive » System 3 CEO confirms upcoming original Wii downloadable games, new California Games included - What are you waiting for? |publisher=GoNintendo |date=2007-05-20 |access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref> The Commodore 64 version was released for the Wii's [[Virtual Console]] service in Europe on April 11, 2008, and in North America on July 6, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vc-reviews.com/games/c64/california_games |title=California Games (Virtual Console) Review |date=7 July 2009 |publisher=Vc-reviews.com |access-date=2019-10-28}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>
