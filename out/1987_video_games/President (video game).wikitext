Following on from Toms' ''Football Manager'' and ''Software Star'' games, ''President'' is a game where the player takes control of a small country, and decides whether to be a dictator, or a hero. The player has to balance the wants and needs of their virtual citizens, while also balancing the books and trying to build up an army and search for oil.
