'''''Agent Orange''''' is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] released by A&F Software in January 1987 for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

==Gameplay==
Tasked with cultivating crops on eight alien planets in order to fund space travel, the player must combat rival alien farmers whilst planting and harvesting crops for income;<ref name="crash">{{cite journal | last = Dunn| first = Mike |author2= Evans, Paul|author3= Stone, Ben| title = Reviews - Agent Orange| journal = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| issue = 38| pages = 23| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications Ltd]]| date = March 1987}}</ref> the ultimate goal is to reach the final planet and take possession of a batch of alien weedkiller called agent orange.<ref name="cvg">{{cite journal | last = Brathwaite| first = Lee | title = C+VG Reviews Shorts - Agent Orange| journal = [[Computer and Video Games]]| issue = 67| pages = 38| publisher = [[EMAP]]| date = May 1987}}</ref> Play begins with the player's [[mothership]] heading to the first planet, the mothership displays the number and strength of enemy farmers on the planet. The mothership contains seeds and 8 smaller daugheterships; seeds generate crops when planted and daughterships are combination fighter craft and planters. When ready the player's first daughtership is launched onto the planet's surface, it is this vehicle which the player directly controls and each represents the player's 'lives'. The daughtership can move in eight directions, the play area scrolls left and right from the mothership.<ref name="crash"/> Alien farmers attack while the daughtership flies around the planet's surface, initially they can be destroyed easily but this becomes more difficult as play progresses.<ref name="su">{{cite journal | last = Douglas| first = Jim | title = Agent Orange| journal = [[Sinclair User]]| issue = 60| pages = 70, 71| publisher = [[EMAP]]| date = March 1987}}</ref>

Aliens plant crops of their own, which act as [[weed]]s and choke the player's own crops, and take up some of the planet surface's limited space suitable for crop planting. These weeds can be destroyed by the player firing on them. Indigenous weeds also spread across planet surfaces,<ref name="zx">{{cite journal | title = Games - Agent Orange| journal = ZX Computing| pages = 38| publisher = [[Argus Specialist Publications]]| date = April 1987}}</ref> unlike alien crops these cannot be razed by the player's weapon fire. The daughtership can plant crops if the player has seed available, when planted seeds grow through three coloured stages, once at the third stage they can be harvested; failure to harvest crops in time will result in them withering. Crops behave in a lifelike fashion; too many or too few crops in an area stunts their growth, players must find the optimum density of crop.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Preview - A Spot of Bovver with the Weedkiller| journal = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| issue = 35| pages = 158| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications Ltd]]| date = December 1986}}</ref> The daughtership can hold a limited amount of crop units, indicated by a bar on the screen which fills when crops are collected, collecting more than the ship can carry will result in a crash landing and the destruction of the vessel.<ref name="ys">{{cite journal | last = Berkmann| first = Marcus | title = Agent Orange| journal = [[Your Sinclair]]| issue = 15| pages = 27| publisher = [[Dennis Publishing]]| date = March 1987}}</ref> The mothership also has limited cargo space, once the mothership's [[hold (ship)|hold]] is full the vessel must return home so that the crops can be sold. The mothership cannot ascend from the planet's surface until all alien aggressors have been eliminated, forcing the player to destroy the enemy before escaping. Upon returning home the harvested crops, remaining seeds and remaining daughterships are converted into cash, allowing the player to purchase new daughterships with improved shields to defend against rivals. At this point the player can return to the same planet, where additional alien farmers will now be present, or move onto the next and more difficult planet. Each new planet features more powerful and numerous alien ships.<ref name="crash"/>

==Reception==
{{expand-section|date=October 2017}}
The Commodore 64 version was rated as being very poor by [[Julian Rignall]] and Paul Sumner of ''[[Zzap!64]]'' magazine, with an overall review score of 37%.<ref name="zzap">{{cite journal | last = Rignall| first = Julian | author-link = Julian Rignall |author2= Sumner, Paul| title = Zzap! Test - Agent Orange| journal = [[Zzap!64]]| issue = 23| pages = 100| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications Ltd]]| date = March 1987}}</ref> Sumner stated that despite the game's graphics; which were rated comparatively higher in the review than other aspects of the game, that underneath it is "a very simple and unchallenging shoot 'em up".<ref name="zzap"/> Rignall drew comparisons with other similar games being released at the time, stating "I'm sick to death with crummy two-way scrolling shoot 'em ups - why do companies keep churning them out onto the market?"<ref name="zzap"/> He continued by comparing the game's [[graphics]] in comparison to gameplay as "gift wrapping an empty cardboard box",<ref name="zzap"/> describing the title's gameplay as lacking the essentials necessary for an exciting shoot 'em up game.<ref name="zzap"/>
