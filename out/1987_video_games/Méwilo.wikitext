== Plot and gameplay ==
Set in the town of [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|Saint-Pierre]], [[Martinique]] on May 7, 1902, the game takes place a day before [[Mount Pelée]] is set to erupt, causing catastrophic damage. The player is a [[Parapsychology|parapsychologist]] called into town to investigate [[zombie]] sightings.<ref name=":0" />

== Release and aftermath ==
Tramis suggests that while the game was a failure in France, ''Mewilo'' performed better in Germany due to the country being "tinged with colonialism".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sipress |url=http://archive.org/details/JoystickHebdo07 |title=Joystick Hebdo 07 |date=1988-12-21}}</ref>

For the 30th anniversary, Tramis created a crowdfunding campaign to create a [[remake]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=ulule |title=MEWILO and the secret of the jar of gold |url=https://www.ulule.com/mewilo/ |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=Ulule |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-06-09 |title=Mewilo 30th anniversary |url=http://mewilo30th.com/ENG-index.php |access-date=2022-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609095523/http://mewilo30th.com/ENG-index.php |archive-date=2018-06-09}}</ref>
