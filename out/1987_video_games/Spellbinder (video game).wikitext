'''''Spellbinder''''' is an adventure game, released for the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] in 1987.<ref name=bbc/>

== Plot ==
The player takes the role of a Magelord, named Eldon the Spellbinder. His task is to find the evil Magelord outcast Zorn, in the castle of Lorraine, and defeat him by use of the so-called Ultimate Spell.

== Gameplay ==
The game is pseudo-3D, allowing the player to move left, right, forwards and backwards in a room, though not up and down. It was presented in a [[monochrome]] format, with black and one other colour being used to draw the sprites and backdrops, although the colour varied from room to room, illustrating the environments. A large number of items could be examined for clues, or searched for possible items. The game was relatively open-ended for a game of the time, similar to ''[[Exile (1988 video game)|Exile]]'', allowing the player to move around a large section of the castle right from the start, and start to mix various spells. A few of these spells were listed in the manual, but most had to be discovered from in-game clues.

Unusually, for a BBC Micro game, it has continuous background music: a version of ''Midnight Summer Dream'', the 1983 song from British rock group [[The Stranglers]]' album ''[[Feline (The Stranglers album)|Feline]]''.

== Development ==
The game was written by Dan and Etan Shirron, two teenagers from Israel. They were 14½ and 16 when they started coding the game in 1986. The equipment used to write it was a memory monitor chip, a monochrome 14" TV, a cassette tape recorder and their own BASIC-written graphic-design software. The game was originally named ''Magelords'', later to be named ''Spellbinder'' by Superior Software marketing team.
