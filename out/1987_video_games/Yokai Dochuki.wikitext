{{nihongo foot|'''''Yokai Dochuki'''''|妖怪道中記|Yōkai Dōchūki|Phantom Travel Journal|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1987 [[platform game|platform]] [[arcade game]] developed and released by [[Namco]] in Japan and other parts of Asia. The player controls a young boy named Tarosuke as he must make his way through Jigoku, the Japanese concept of Hell, to reach [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], who will determine his fate. Tarosuke can fire small "[[Qi|ki]]" bullets at enemies to defeat them; he can also charge them to increase their power. Enemies will drop money when defeated, which can be used to purchase weapons and other items in stores. Two versions of the arcade original were released: a Japanese version and an English version which was released in other Asian countries outside Japan. The [[Arcade Archives]] release includes both versions.

==Release==
The game was later ported to the [[PC Engine]], and [[Family Computer]] consoles with several additions and different level design; the PC Engine version and the arcade version were both later re-released for the Japanese [[Virtual Console]]. The game was also followed by a Japan-only spin-off in 1990 named ''[[Kyūkai Dōchūki]]'', which is a "yakyū" ([[baseball]]) video game that plays similar to the entirety of Namco's own ''[[World Stadium]]'' series.

Tarosuke also appears as a playable character in the Japan-only [[role-playing game|role-playing]] [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[Namco X Capcom]]'', where he is teamed up with Taira no Kagekiyo from ''Genpei Tōma Den''. He also makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Project X Zone 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]].
