{{Nihongo foot|'''''After Burner'''''|アフターバーナー|Afutā Bānā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[rail shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and released by [[Sega]] in 1987.<ref name="KLOV"/><ref name="YS26"/> The player controls an American [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14 Tomcat]] fighter jet and must clear each of the game's eighteen unique stages by destroying incoming enemies. The plane is equipped with a machine gun and a limited supply of heat-seeking missiles. The game uses a third-person perspective, as in Sega's earlier ''[[Space Harrier]]'' (1985) and ''[[Out Run]]'' (1986). It runs on the [[Sega X Board]] arcade system which is capable of surface and [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] rotation. It is the fourth Sega game to use a hydraulic "taikan" [[motion simulator]] [[arcade cabinet]], one that is more elaborate than their earlier "taikan" simulator games.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games |date=6 July 2018 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-3196-7 |page=131 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qZhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA131 |quote=''After Burner'' was the fourth and most extravagant of Sega's taikan simulators and topping it would not be easy.}}</ref> The cabinet simulates an aircraft cockpit, with [[flight stick]] controls, a chair with seatbelt, and hydraulic motion technology that moves, tilts, rolls and rotates the cockpit in sync with the on-screen action.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Lendino |first1=Jamie |title=Attract Mode: The Rise and Fall of Coin-Op Arcade Games |date=27 September 2020 |publisher=Steel Gear Press |page=331 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6wCEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA331}}</ref>

Designed by Sega veteran [[Yu Suzuki]] and the [[Sega AM2]] division, ''After Burner'' was intended as being Sega's first "true blockbuster" video game. Development began in December 1986, shortly after the completion of ''Out Run'', and was kept as a closely guarded secret within the company. Suzuki was inspired by the 1986 films ''[[Top Gun]]'' and ''[[Laputa: Castle in the Sky]]''; he originally planned for the game to have an aesthetic similar to ''Laputa'', but instead went with a ''Top Gun'' look to make the game approachable for worldwide audiences. It was designed outside the company in a building named "Studio 128", due to Sega adopting a [[flextime]] schedule to allow for games to be worked on outside company headquarters. An updated version with the addition of [[throttle]] controls, '''''[[#After Burner II|After Burner II]]''''', was released later the same year.

''After Burner'' was a worldwide commercial success, becoming Japan's second highest-grossing large [[1987 in video games|arcade game of 1987]] and overall [[1988 in video games|arcade game of 1988]] as well as among America's top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1988. It was acclaimed by critics for its impressive visuals, gameplay and overall presentation, and is seen as being important and influential. It was followed by a series of sequels and ports for many platforms, including the [[Master System]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[Famicom]]. Sega also produced several successors to the game to capitalize on its success, such as ''[[G-LOC: Air Battle]]''. ''After Burner'' has also been referenced in many other Sega video games, such as ''[[Fighters Megamix]]'', ''[[Shenmue]]'', and ''[[Bayonetta (video game)|Bayonetta]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:After Burner screenshot.png|thumb|left|Arcade version]]
The game allows the player to control an [[F-14 Tomcat]] jet airplane. At the start of the game, the player takes off from an aircraft carrier called the ''SEGA Enterprise'' on a mission to destroy enemy jets over 18 stages.

In the arcade version, the jet employs a machine gun and a limited number of heat-seeking missiles (in the [[Master System]] version the player has unlimited missiles). These weapons are replenished by another aircraft, after beating a few stages. The aircraft, cannon and missile buttons are all controlled from an integrated [[Joystick|flight stick]].

The game itself was released in two variations in the US: a standard upright cabinet and a closed rotating cockpit ''deluxe'' version. In the cockpit version, the seat tilted forward and backwards, and the cockpit rotated from side to side.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web |url=http://www.klov.com/A/After_Burner.html|title=KLOV entry for After Burner |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |access-date=2009-04-23}}</ref> It featured two speakers at head-level for stereo sound, and had a seatbelt to hold the player when the cockpit moved. Both cabinets contained a grey monitor frame with flashing lights at the top that indicated an enemy's "lock" on the player's craft. Japan also received a commander cabinet that moved left and right. A third variation, called ''commander'', released elsewhere, featured an open cabinet.

==Development and release==
''After Burner'' was designed by [[Yu Suzuki]] of [[Sega AM2]], with assistance by programmer Satoshi Mifune and composer Hiroshi "Hiro" Kawaguchi.<ref name="Interviews">{{cite web |title=After Burner II - Developer Interviews |url=http://shmuplations.com/afterburner/ |website=Shmuplations |access-date=27 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230191946/http://shmuplations.com/afterburner/ |archive-date=30 December 2019}}</ref> Development of the game begin in early December 1986 shortly after work on ''[[Out Run]]'' was completed, with much of the development team having worked on ''Out Run''.<ref name="Interviews"/> ''After Burner'' was intended as Sega's first "true blockbuster" video game; as such, the project was kept as a closely guarded secret within the company during the entirety of its development cycle.<ref name="Interviews"/> When the game was in its initial concept stages, Sega had adopted a [[flextime]] work system, allowing development of games to be done outside the company; ''After Burner'' was one of the first games to be produced under this new system, with development taking place in a building named "Studio 128".<ref name="Interviews"/>

Suzuki was inspired by the film ''[[Laputa: Castle in the Sky]]'' and initially wanted to employ a similar aesthetic for ''After Burner'', but this idea was scrapped early on in favor of a style akin to the movie ''[[Top Gun]]'', as Suzuki wanted the game more approachable for a worldwide audience.<ref name="Interviews"/> The game was programmed and tested on a [[PC-98]] system, making it the first Sega-published video game to be developed using [[personal computer]]s rather than [[workstation]]s.<ref name="Interviews"/>

[[File:Sega Afterburner.jpg|thumb|right|The interior parts of a ''commander'' sit-down arcade cabinet for ''After Burner''.]]

One of the biggest challenges the team had to overcome was researching and implementing sprite and surface rotation, which for the time was considered a milestone in video games.<ref name="Interviews"/> The team also struggled with creating the smoke trails made by firing missiles, seeing several tweaks and revisions as development progressed.<ref name="Interviews"/> Unlike their earlier game ''Out Run'', which featured real-world locations in its levels, Suzuki lacked the time to visit any specific places or landmarks, so he and his team made up their own stage settings.<ref name="Interviews"/> Suzuki toyed with the idea of having the [[Soviet Union]] as the antagonists to potentially increase sales in the west, but decided against it later on after struggling to tie it together with the game's level designs and settings.<ref name="Interviews"/> The refueling and landing sequences were created to add variety.<ref name="Interviews"/>

The ''After Burner'' arcade cabinet was significantly more expensive than most of Sega's other machines at the time.<ref name="Interviews"/> The first prototype unit constructed, which consisted of the monitor attached to a steel frame, was claimed by Mifune to have "amazing power", but was considered too dangerous to operate and had the power levels lowered.<ref name="Interviews"/> Suzuki also thought of the game using a gyroscopic arcade cabinet that spun the player around, an idea that later became the [[Sega R360|R-360]].<ref name="Interviews"/> A throttle control was briefly considered, but was abandoned as it would have destroyed the game's difficulty balance. It uses the [[Sega X Board]], which was also used for games such as ''[[Thunder Blade]]'' (1987) and ''[[Super Monaco GP]]'' (1989). ''After Burner'' was officially released in Japan in July 1987, and in October of that year in North America.<ref name="Akagi">{{cite book|last=Akagi|first=Masumi|url=https://archive.org/stream/ArcadeGameList1971-2005#page/n37/mode/1up|title=セガ社 (Sega); Sega; A|work=アーケードTVゲームリスト 国内•海外編 (1971-2005)|edition=1st|publisher=Amusement News Agency|date=13 October 2006|pages=36, 131, 145|isbn=978-4990251215|language=ja}}</ref> In Europe, it was released in September 1987,<ref name="YS23"/> with the hydraulic sit-in cabinet costing £4,000, or {{US$|{{To USD|4000|GBR|year=1987|r=-2}}|1987|long=no|round=-3}}, in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Jenkins |first1=Chris |title=Back to the Future: Coin-ops in 1988 |magazine=[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]] |date=4 February 1988 |issue=6 (March 1988) |pages=25–27 (25) |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/10/358}}</ref>

==''After Burner II''==
[[File:After Burner II.jpg|thumb|European box art of ''After Burner II'' (note erroneous use of [[F-15]]).]]

''After Burner'' was followed by ''After Burner II'', which was released in the same year (1987),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=6822 |title =After Burner II |publisher =The International Arcade Museum |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20200120152913/http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=6822 |access-date =1 Nov 2013 |archive-date =2020-01-20}}</ref> also released for the [[Sega X Board]] arcade system. Some consider this game to be more of a revision of its predecessor, rather than an entirely new game, a practice later repeated by Sega for ''[[Galaxy Force (arcade game)|Galaxy Force]]'' and ''Galaxy Force II''. In the game, players fly an [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14 Tomcat]] jet fighter, gunning down enemies while avoiding incoming fire. ''After Burner II'' came both a standard [[arcade cabinet]] and a [[Servomechanism|servo]] actuated, sit-down [[motion simulator]] version which moved according to the motion of the plane onscreen. The cockpit would bank in the same direction the on-screen aircraft was banking. It is an updated version of ''After Burner'', with the addition of [[throttle]] controls. It was a commercial success, becoming Japan's highest-grossing [[1988 in video games|arcade game of 1988]].

The game was mostly created by three men: [[Yu Suzuki]], Satoshi Mifune, and Kawaguchi. During development, it was codenamed ''Studio 128'' to specify the secrecy of the project.<ref>{{Cite web|author=blackoak|url=http://shmuplations.com/afterburner/|title=shmuplations.com|website=shmuplations.com|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>

The arcade game received positive reviews from critics. Clare Edgeley of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called it a "fabulous game" with praise for the gameplay and motion cabinet while noting it has a lock-on mechanic similar to the [[Data East]] arcade game ''[[Lock-On (video game)|Lock-On]]'' (1986).<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |last=Edgeley |first=Clare |title=Arcade Action: After Burner |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=15 October 1987 |issue=73 (November 1987) |page=134 |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-073/page/n133}}</ref> ''Top Score'' said it has "all the finger-numbing action of the best arcade shoot-em-ups, combined with some of the most stunning animation ever seen in a video game" and that it was "a glossy air combat game that ranks higher than similar efforts that have preceded it".

The C64 has two versions: a European version by U.S. Gold, and a US version by Activision and Weebee Games. A port of ''After Burner'' to the 32X was done by Rutubo Games, and was known as ''[[After Burner Complete]]'' in Japan and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=721&redirect=%2Fgames%2Fsearch%2Easp%3Fdevelopers%3D1437|title=VGRebirth entry for After Burner Complete|access-date=2008-06-06|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726212247/http://www.vgrebirth.org/games/game.asp?id=721&redirect=%2Fgames%2Fsearch.asp%3Fdevelopers%3D1437 |archive-date=2011-07-26}}</ref> An unlicensed [[NES]] port of the game developed by [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] also exists, which was reworked by [[Sunsoft]] for their Japanese-exclusive port to the same console. A port of ''After Burner'' to the [[Game Boy Advance]] was included in an arcade 4 pack named ''[[Sega Arcade Gallery]]''.

''After Burner'' for the [[Master System]] was a best-seller for Sega in the United States during 1988.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gellene |first1=Denise |title=The Joystick Lives: New Technology, Better Marketing Give Video Games a Second Life |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21593457/nintendo-report-1987-super-mario/ |access-date=13 September 2021 |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=13 June 1988 |pages=57}}</ref>

Reviewing the 32X version, ''[[GamePro]]'' commented that the graphics, sound, and gameplay are all great, but that the only difference between it and the Genesis version of ''[[After Burner II]]'' are some minor graphical and audio enhancements, making it only worthwhile to gamers who have never played an ''After Burner'' game before.<ref name="GamePro">{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Afterburner|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=78|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1995|page=60}}</ref>

The game was rebuilt with [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic 3D]] feature as one of [[3D Classics]] for [[Nintendo 3DS]].

==Legacy==
===Sequels and related games===
Although the ''After Burner'' brand was long dormant, Sega created a number of aerial combat games centered on the [[F-14]] Tomcat with many similar features, which are frequently regarded as part of the series.<ref>[http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=after-burner-commander-model&page=detail&id=19580 Arcade-history.com]</ref><ref>[http://system16.com/hardware.php?id=698&page=1#1847 System16.com]</ref> These include ''[[G-LOC: Air Battle]]'' and its sequel ''[[Strike Fighter]]'' (later rebranded ''[[After Burner III]]'' in its home release). Later games associated with the series include ''[[Sky Target]]'' (which retained similar gameplay and presentation to the original, but with the addition of 3D graphics) and ''Sega Strike Fighter'' (an arcade flight combat game which featured free-roaming movement, boasting similar music but with an F/A-18 Hornet as the main plane).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=5566&image=2|title=Arcade Flyer for Sega Strike Fighter|access-date=2012-04-17}}</ref>

In 2006, Sega released a new sequel on [[Sega Lindbergh]] hardware, ''[[After Burner Climax]]'', the first arcade game to bear the brand since ''After Burner II''.

''After Burner Climax'' was later ported to [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and [[PlayStation Network|PSN]]. It was followed by the spin-off ''[[After Burner: Black Falcon]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] in 2007. ''After Burner Climax'' was de-listed in December 2014, leaving the game no longer available for purchase, only to be brought back in March 2019 to digital mobile platforms for free, with ads, under the ''[[Sega Forever]]'' brand.

In Japan, ''After Burner II'' was released on the [[PlayStation 2]] as part of the ''[[Sega Ages]]'' classic series.

[[M2 (game developer)|M2]] ported ''After Burner II'' in Sega's [[3D Classics]] series to the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]] in Japan on 2013 and worldwide in 2015. This version is faithful to the original arcade game with additions, including Touch Controls and screen layouts that resemble the Upright as well as the Commander and Deluxe cabinets. An unlockable new Special mode was also added, which used a time-slowing "Burst" system similar to ''[[After Burner Climax]]'', and featured a different story and altered stages. This mode has no stage select or continues, and instead depends on frequent acquisition of extra lives over the course of the game in order to complete it.<ref>[http://archives.sega.jp/3d/ab2/index.html Sega 3D Classics After Burner II page (Japan)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211111318/http://archives.sega.jp/3d/ab2/index.html |date=2015-02-11}}</ref>
