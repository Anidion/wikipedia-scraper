'''''Xybots''''' is a [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] [[third-person shooter]]<ref name="AllGame">{{cite web|url=https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11604|title=Xybots|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010101/https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11604|archive-date=2014-01-01|url-status=dead|website=[[All Media Network#AllGame|AllGame]]}}</ref> [[arcade game]] by [[Atari Games]]. In ''Xybots'', up to two players control "Major Rock Hardy" and "Captain Ace Gunn", who must travel through a 3D maze and fight against a series of robots known as the Xybots whose mission is to destroy all mankind. The game features a split screen display showing the gameplay on the bottom half of the screen and information on player status and the current level on the top half. Designed by [[Ed Logg]], it was originally conceived as a sequel to his previous title, ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]''. The game was well received, with reviewers lauding the game's various features, particularly the cooperative multiplayer aspect. Despite this, it was met with limited financial success, which has been attributed to its unique control scheme that involves rotating the joystick to turn the player character.

''Xybots'' was [[ported]] to various personal computers and the [[Atari Lynx]] handheld. Versions for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]] were announced, but never released.<ref name="EGM9b2">{{cite magazine|last=Harris|first=Steve|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_Issue_009_April_1990#page/n74/mode/1up|title=Outpost: Genesis - Genesis Games Getting Even Better!|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=9|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=April 1990|pages=73–77}}</ref> [[Emulated]] versions of the arcade game were later released as part of various compilations, starting with ''[[Midway Arcade Treasures 2]]'' in 2004.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC Xybots.png|thumb|left|The gameplay area shows the perspectives of both characters in the lower half of the screen, with the top half being split between the player statuses and level map.]]
One or two players navigate through corridors as either Rock Hardy or Ace Gunn, battling enemy Xybots with a laser gun, seeking cover from enemy fire behind various objects and attempting to reach the level's exit. In certain levels, players face off against a large [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] Xybot. Players move using the joystick, which also rotates to turn the player character. The lower half the screen shows the gameplay area for both players while the upper half is split between the map for the current level and the [[HUD (video gaming)|status display]] for each player. The display shows the player's remaining energy, which can be replenished by collecting energy pods within the levels. Energy can also be purchased at shops between levels, using coins dropped by defeated Xybots.<ref name="CU">{{cite news|title=Xybots|publisher=Commodore User|last=Kelly|first=Nick|date=February 1988|pages=108–109|url=https://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/264/407/xybots_review.html}}</ref> The player can also purchase [[power-ups]] at these shops, including extra armor, increased speed, strength and firepower along with maze and enemy maps.<ref name="CVG">{{cite news|title=Xybots|date=February 1988|pages=122–123|url=https://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/233/407/xybots_review.html|publisher=Computer+Video Games}}</ref><ref name="TGM">{{cite news|title=Xybots|date=February 1988|url=https://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/20/407/xybots_review.html|pages=69–70|publisher=The Games Machine}}</ref>

==Development==
The concept for the game was born out of an attempt by designer [[Ed Logg]] and engineer/technician Doug Snyder to create a first-person video game without specialized hardware. In 2005, Logg recalled that he had trouble with the controls for the game—both building controls that worked with the game design and getting players to realize they could rotate the joystick to turn the in-game characters. Because of these difficulties, Logg was unsure if the game would enter mass production. Originally Logg envisioned the game as a second sequel to ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'' titled ''Gauntlet III: Catacombs.'' However, the marketing department at Atari Games did not want to make another ''Gauntlet'' game and made him change the title. Logg and co-programmer Bob Flanagan eventually settled on a theme based on ''[[Major Havoc]]'', a previous Atari arcade game.<ref name="GTM">{{cite news|title=Behind the Scenes: Xybot|publisher=Future Publishing|work=GamesTM|pages=152–555|issue=39}}</ref>

Upon release, the game was positively reviewed. It drew favorable comparisons to both ''[[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]'' and ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'' for its maze-like stages and shooting gameplay.<ref name="TGM" /><ref name="Crash">{{cite news|title=Xybots|publisher=Crash|date=May 1988|pages=34–35|url=https://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/77/407/xybots_review.html}}</ref> The game's various features, including the cooperative gameplay, were praised, with ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' and ''[[The Games Machine]]'' citing them as aspects that made the game addictive.<ref name="CVG" /><ref name="TGM" /> ''[[Commodore User]]'' also cited the two-player game as a highlight, saying "its real appeal is as a team game, with you and your mate running about the place, covering each other, dividing up and destroying all the robots in the maze, and lending one another gold coins in the shop."<ref name="CU" />

Ed Logg recalled in 2005 that the game was not a financial success. ''[[GamesTM]]'' wrote that "''Xybots'' was overlooked in arcades due to its complex controls and tricky gameplay" and that its lack of earnings in arcades was the reason no sequel was ever developed. In retrospect, they wrote that the game was "ahead of its time" and "offered a unique experience that similar games of the era were unable to match."<ref name="GTM" />

A planned [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] port from Tengen also went unreleased.<ref>{{cite web |title=Xybots [NES – Unreleased] |url=https://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/11/xybots-nes-unreleased/ |website=Unseen64 |date=11 April 2008 |access-date=28 August 2022}}</ref>
