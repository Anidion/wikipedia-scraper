'''''Goldrunner''''' is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] developed by Steve Bak<ref name="giantlist"/> and [[Pete Lyon]] for the [[Atari ST]] and published by [[Microdeal]] in 1987. [[Rob Hubbard]] composed the music.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.karsmakers.nl/metal-e-zine/robb.htm | title=Interview with Rob Hubbard }}</ref> An [[Amiga]] version followed, as well as a 1988 sequel, ''Goldrunner II''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldrunner II|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-st-goldrunner-ii_9465.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
''Goldrunner'' is a freely vertically scrolling shooter game where it is possible to fly back and forth as in ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]''. The player steers a golden spaceship equipped with two laser cannons, flying over huge ring worlds whose structures must be destroyed. The ship has a speed booster to accelerate.

== Legacy ==
The immediate follow-on, ''Goldrunner II'', offered a similar aesthetic to the original title. A third entry in the series was planned, entitled ''Goldrunner 3D.'' This was to mark a departure from the traditional 2D scrolling shooter format with a radical new look and gameplay. Trailed as early as 1989,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Goldrunner 3D preview from Zero 2 (Dec 1989) - Amiga Magazine Rack|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_39308|access-date=2020-07-27|website=amr.abime.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Goldrunner 3D preview from CU Amiga-64 (Nov 1989) - Amiga Magazine Rack|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_17641|access-date=2020-07-27|website=amr.abime.net}}</ref> the project suffered significant delays however, finally seeing release under [[Ocean Software|Ocean]] as [[Epic (video game)|''Epic'']] in 1992.
