'''''Streaker''''' is an [[action game]] published by [[Mastertronic]] on their "Bulldog" label in 1987. The game was released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]], [[ZX Spectrum]].

==Plot==
The hero of the game is Carlin, a naked man who has been mugged and stripped, and needs to find all of his clothes. Carlin is in a town on the planet Zuggi, which resembles a town in Earth in many ways, with locations including an [[hotel]], a [[Coffeehouse|cafe]], a [[supermarket]] and a [[Pharmacy|chemist's shop]]. As Streaker finds more clothes, he is able to enter more and more locations. The game is won when he is fully dressed.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay is controlled through a nested menu system, as in [[Mastertronic]]'s ''[[Spellbound (video game)|Spellbound]]''. There are a multitude of items in the game, many of which can be used and some of which seem to have no purpose. Streaker can pick up [[key (lock)|key]]s to open doors, eat food items to raise his hunger levels, and needs to solve a number of simple puzzles.

While most aspects of life on Zuggi are very similar to Earth, there are a number of fantastic elements in the world. For example, Streaker may [[Teleportation|teleport]] ("beam transfer") by using a number of different coloured beamers. These will teleport Streaker to the location of the corresponding beampad. These beampads can be moved by Streaker and are a good way to avoid thieves. Nice touches include Streaker's ability to advance time by acquiring a stopwatch (the game is played in real time, and you often need to wait for a particular location to open) and the "Save" and "Load" options appearing after Streaker picks up a Tape Recorder.

Streaker's quest is made more difficult by the presence of a number of thieves. They will steal Streaker's clothes on contact, or cause him to lose a life if he is naked. The clothes may be regained from the thieves by finding and offering the thief an item that he wants.
