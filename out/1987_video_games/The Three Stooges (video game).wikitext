'''''The Three Stooges''''' is a [[video game]] released by [[Cinemaware]] in 1987 for the [[Amiga]] based on the [[The Three Stooges|comedy trio of the same name]]. Players control Stooges [[Moe Howard|Moe]], [[Larry Fine|Larry]], and [[Curly Howard|Curly]] in [[minigame]]s based on Stooges films with the aim of raising enough money to save an [[orphanage]]. It was ported to the [[Apple IIGS]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Game Boy Advance]]. The game has been praised as a faithful adaptation of the Stooges films, but has been criticized for repetitive gameplay and limited [[replay value]].<ref name="ferrell198809" />

A [[video game remake|remake]] was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Macintosh]]. {{fact|date=March 2024}}

==Gameplay==
[[File:Three stooges screenshot.png|thumb|left|Players must select a minigame to complete for each in-game day.]]

John Cutter designed the game as a kind of [[board game]].<ref name="Gamasutra">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/26583/Interview_Bob_Jacob_On_The_Cinemaware_Era.php|title=Interview: Bob Jacob On The Cinemaware Era|last=Barton|first=Matt|date=2010-01-05|website=Gamasutra|access-date=2010-06-11}}</ref>
The Three Stooges must rescue an old woman's orphanage by earning money in minigames based on various Three Stooges films. These include cracker-eating contests (based on the Stooges short ''[[Dutiful But Dumb]]'') and boxing matches (based on the short ''[[Punch Drunks]]'').<ref name="Joystiq">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/17/virtually-overlooked-the-three-stooges/|title=Virtually Overlooked: The Three Stooges|last=Fletcher|first=JC|date=2008-04-17|access-date=2010-06-11}}</ref> Players select minigames by timing a button press as a hand randomly points to various symbols representing in-game events, including non-interactive events that can raise or lower the Stooges' cash total. Each event takes up one in-game day; players have 30 in-game days to earn as much money as possible.<ref name="YourAmiga">"The Three Stooges." Your Amiga. Aug–Sep 1988. pp 24-25.</ref>

The hand gradually speeds up from one day to the next, but can be slowed down by landing on a space that allows Moe to pummel Larry and Curly. The player must avoid mousetrap spaces, which injure the fingers on the hand; landing on four such spaces immediately ends the game, regardless of the number of days completed. {{fact|date=March 2024}}

Several different game endings are possible, depending on the amount of money the player has earned. These range from the banker foreclosing on the orphanage due to the Stooges' inability to collect enough money to pay the rent, to the orphanage being saved and renovated and the Stooges marrying the owner's three daughters.<ref name="YourAmiga" />

==Reception==
The Amiga version of the game received mixed reviews, with the game's graphics and digital voices receiving most of the praise. Mark Patterson of [[Commodore User]] gave the game an 8 out of 10, citing positive impressions of the game's humor, writing that the game was "probably the only game that has intentionally set out to make people laugh, and worked."<ref name="YourAmiga" /><ref name="CommodoreUser">The Three Stooges Review. May 1988. pp 62-63.</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' wrote that the Amiga and Commodore 64 versions "captured the Three Stooges magic", stating that for fans of the trio it was "simultaneously a delight and piece of 'living' memorabilia".<ref name="wilson198808">{{cite news | title=Yes, We Have No Bananas! | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1988 | author=Wilson, David M. | pages=30}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' called ''The Three Stooges'' "one of the high points of the season", stating that the game "''looks'' like the Stooges, ''sounds'' like the Stooges ... and most important, ''feels'' like the Stooges".<ref name="ferrell198809">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-09-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_100_1988_Sep#page/n67/mode/2up | title=The Three Stooges | work=Compute! | date=September 1988 | access-date=2013-11-10 | author=Ferrell, Keith | pages=66}}</ref> However, Commodore Computing International criticized the game's limited replay value and long loading times. The publication also criticized the game's lack of a "common theme" and called the game "a little disjointed."<ref name="CCI">"The Three Stooges." Commodore Computing International. August 1998. p 89.</ref> [[The Games Machine]] offered similar criticism, stating that while the game is "a masterpiece in FX and presentation", the gameplay is "disappointingly shallow."<ref name="GamesMachine">"Where There's Nyuk There's Brass." The Games Machine. June 7, 1988. p 54.</ref> Six reviewers in ''Digital Press'' gave the NES version 9, 7, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (all out of 10).<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Santulli|first=Joe|title= Random Reviews|url= https://archive.org/stream/Digital_Press_Issue_21_1994-09_Santulli_Joe_US#page/n9/mode/2up|magazine= Digital Press|page= 10|date= September 1994}}</ref>
