{{nihongo foot|'''''Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished''''',|イース Ancient Ys Vanished|Īsu}} also known as '''''Ys: The Vanished Omens'''''  or '''''The Ancient Land of Ys''''' (Japanese title: イース), is a 1987 [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[Nihon Falcom]]. It is the first installment in the [[Ys (series)|''Ys'' series]]. Initially developed for the [[PC-8800 series]] by [[Quintet (company)|Masaya Hashimoto]] (director, programmer, designer) and [[Quintet (company)|Tomoyoshi Miyazaki]] (scenario writer), the game was soon ported to the [[Sharp X1]], [[PC-98]], [[FM-7]], and [[MSX2]] Japanese computer systems.<ref name="gtm_falcom_154"/>

Set in a land called Esteria, the story centers around the titular civilization called Ys, which had mysteriously vanished 700 years ago with only traces of its existence being mentioned within the game's six books. When rumors of an impending darkness threatening to consume Esteria begin to spread, a young and adventurous warrior named Adol Christin is chosen to collect these six books to aid him in vanquishing the mysterious threat. 

''Ancient Ys Vanished'' saw many subsequent releases, such as an English-language version for the [[Master System]] and an [[Video game remake|enhanced remake]] for the [[TurboGrafx-CD]] system as part of a compilation called ''[[Ys I & II]]'', alongside its 1988 sequel ''[[Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished – The Final Chapter]]''. [[Dotemu|DotEmu]] has released the game on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] with the following localizations: English, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Italian, German, and Portuguese.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ys Chronicles I (Ancient Ys Vanished Omen)|url=https://www.dotemu.com/game/ys-chronicles-omen/|access-date=2020-12-12|website=Dotemu|language=fr-FR|archive-date=2021-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116105459/https://www.dotemu.com/game/ys-chronicles-omen/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Plot==
''Ys'' was a precursor to role-playing games that emphasize storytelling.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ys Series|url=http://www.falcom.com/licence/character/ys_e.html|publisher=[[Nihon Falcom]]|access-date=23 April 2012|archive-date=3 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203034546/http://www.falcom.com/licence/character/ys_e.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The hero of ''Ys'' is an adventurous young swordsman named Adol Christin. As the story begins, he has just arrived at the Town of Minea, in the land of Esteria. He is called upon by Sara, a fortune-teller, who tells him of a great evil that is sweeping the land.

Adol is informed that he must seek out the six Books of Ys. These books contain the history of the ancient land of Ys, and will give him the knowledge he needs to defeat the evil forces. Sara gives Adol a crystal for identification and instructs him to find her aunt in Zepik Village, who holds the key to retrieving one of the Books. With that, his quest begins.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Adol on a game field viewed from a [[top-down perspective]]. As he travels on the main field and explores dungeons, Adol encounters numerous roaming enemies, which he must battle in order to progress.

Combat in ''Ys'' is rather different from other RPGs of the era, which either had [[turn-based]] battles or a manually activated sword. ''Ys'' instead features a battle system where fighters automatically attack when walking into their enemies off-center. When one fighter comes into contact with an enemy, damage can be sustained on both sides if both combatants are facing each other. Attacking straight-on causes the attacker the most damage to himself, but clipping the edge of the defender causes the attacked fighter to take most or all of the damage. If one fighter contacts the enemy's side or back, only the attacked fighter will sustain damage. This combat system was created with accessibility in mind. This "bump attack" system has become one of the series' defining features.<ref name="gtm_falcom">{{cite journal|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=Falcom: Legacy of Ys|journal=[[GamesTM|Games<sup>TM</sup>]]|date=7 July 2011|issue=111|pages=152–159 [153]|url=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/32/yshistory02.jpg/|access-date=2011-09-07|archive-date=2012-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023182039/http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/32/yshistory02.jpg/|url-status=dead}} ([[cf.]] {{cite web|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=History of Ys interviews|url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/07/history-of-ys-interviews-by-john.html|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=6 September 2011|date=July 8, 2011|archive-date=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AxjEMeyl?url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/07/history-of-ys-interviews-by-john.html|url-status=live}})</ref> Falcom staff have compared this style of gameplay to the enjoyment of popping air bubble sheets, in the sense that it took the tedious task of [[Grinding (video gaming)|level-grinding]] and turned it into something similar to a [[High score|high-score]]-based [[arcade video game]]. According to ''[[GamesTM|Games<sup>TM</sup>]]'' and John Szczepaniak of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' and ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'', "repetition of the act was pleasurable as you developed a psychological rhythm and, even in the event of backtracking, progress was always swift since the player never needed to stop moving".<ref name="gtm_falcom_154">{{cite journal|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=Falcom: Legacy of Ys|journal=[[GamesTM|Games<sup>TM</sup>]]|date=7 July 2011|issue=111|pages=152–159 [154]|url=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/844/yshistory03.jpg/|access-date=2011-09-08|archive-date=2012-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023182108/http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/844/yshistory03.jpg/|url-status=dead}} ([[cf.]] {{cite web|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=History of Ys interviews|url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/07/history-of-ys-interviews-by-john.html|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=8 September 2011|date=July 8, 2011|archive-date=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AxjEMeyl?url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/07/history-of-ys-interviews-by-john.html|url-status=live}})</ref>

Another feature that has been used in nearly every ''Ys'' title since the original is the [[Health (gaming)#Recharging health|recharging health]] mechanism, which had previously been used in the ''[[Hydlide]]'' series. Recharging health has since become a common mechanism used in many video games today.<ref name="gtm_falcom"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Hydlide|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/hydlide/hydlide.htm|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|last1=Kalata|first1=Kurt|last2=Greene|first2=Robert|access-date=2011-09-08|archive-date=2016-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429001619/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/hydlide/hydlide.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Ports==
[[File:Ys SMS Box.JPG|thumb|left|Cover art for the North American and European release of ''Ys'' on the Master System]]

Aside from graphical differences, the game layout remains essentially the same across the many ports of ''Ys''; there are some versions where the details were changed. The [[Master System]] version, for example, saw some of the game's dungeon areas flipped horizontally (including some other minor differences).

The most distinctive of the early ports was the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] edition, which was published by [[Victor Entertainment|Victor Musical Industries]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=3243|title=イース [ファミコン] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-24|archive-date=2015-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426025953/http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=3243|url-status=live}}</ref> This version was a vast departure from the original, featuring entirely new layouts for the towns, field, and dungeons, replacement of a number of the original musical tracks, and a new final battle sequence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The version developed for the [[MSX2]] contained a handful of new musical tracks which replaced part of the original game's soundtrack. Some of these tracks, along with a number of unused tracks first composed for the original, were later incorporated into the soundtrack of ''Ys Eternal'' and ''Ys Complete''.

The versions developed for the [[TurboGrafx-CD]], released as ''[[Ys I & II]]'' in 1989, included additional [[cutscene]]s, such as an opening detailing Adol's arrival in the town of Minea. The [[Microsoft Windows]]-based remakes, ''Ys Eternal'' and ''Ys Complete'', expand further on this and many other story elements, through both cutscenes and additional gameplay.

The 1991 [[Video game remake|remake]] for the [[X68000]] uses [[pre-rendering|pre-rendered 3D graphics]] for the boss [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], which was called "a bizarre contrast" with the game's mostly [[2D computer graphics|2D graphics]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=Falcom: Legacy of Ys|journal=[[GamesTM|Games<sup>TM</sup>]]|date=7 July 2011|issue=111|pages=152–159 [157]|url=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/718/yshistory06.jpg/|access-date=2011-09-09|archive-date=2012-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718225754/http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/718/yshistory06.jpg/|url-status=dead}} ([[cf.]] {{cite web|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|title=History of Ys interviews|url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/07/history-of-ys-interviews-by-john.html|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=9 September 2011|date=July 8, 2011|archive-date=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AxjEMeyl?url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2011/07/history-of-ys-interviews-by-john.html|url-status=live}})</ref>

In 2024, a [[Nintendo Switch]] port based on the PC-8801 version was released by [[D4 Enterprise]] as part of their EGGCONSOLE series.

==Music==
Composed by [[Yuzo Koshiro]] along with Mieko Ishikawa, the soundtrack is notable for its rich melodies,<ref name="kalata_ys">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|title=Ys|url=http://hardcoregaming101.net/ys/ys.htm|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=3 September 2011|date=2010-11-27|archive-date=2012-10-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004180928/http://hardcoregaming101.net/ys/ys.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> in an age when [[video game music]] was beginning to progress from monotonous bleeps.

Several soundtrack albums dedicated to the music of ''Ys'' have been released by Falcom. This includes:
*'''''Music from Ys''''' (1987): Contains the soundtrack to the original PC-8801 edition, along with a number of unused tracks and the replacement tracks used in the MSX edition, many of which were later incorporated into the ''Ys Eternal'' soundtrack. Also included are five arranged tracks from Ryo Yonemitsu, who arranged the soundtrack to the [[TurboGrafx-CD]] version of ''[[Ys I & II]]'' (1989).
* '''''Perfect Collection Ys''''' (1990): A two-disc release, the first disc of which is a new arrangement of the ''Ys'' soundtrack by Ryo Yonemitsu. The second disc contains assorted arrangements of tracks from both ''Ys I'' and ''II''.
* '''''Music from Ys Renewal''''' (1995): The complete ''Ys'' soundtrack, including the bonus tracks, reproduced on upgraded synthesizer equipment.

The Master System version of ''Ys'' received positive reviews.
