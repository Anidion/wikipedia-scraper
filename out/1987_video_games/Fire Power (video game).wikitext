'''''Fire Power''''' (also ''Firepower'') is a military tank [[action game]] developed by Silent Software for the [[Amiga]]. It was released in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] and published by [[MicroIllusions]] and [[Activision]]. Ports were released for the [[Apple IIGS]], the [[Commodore 64]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pctimeline.info/c64/c641988.htm | title=Chronology of the Commodore 64 Computer (1988) }}</ref> and for [[MS-DOS]] in 1988. An [[Atari Lynx]] version was planned but development never started due to internal conflict with [[Epyx]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Ash|url=https://retrogamingblog.co.uk/2015/05/14/reichart-von-wolfsheild-3do-return-fire-and-the-industry/|title=Reichart Von Wolfshield - 3DO, Return Fire and the Video Game Industry: Interview|website=retrogamingblog.co.uk|date=May 14, 2015|accessdate=2019-04-21}}</ref>

==Summary==
The gameplay consists of controlling a tank through an expansive, outdoor landscape. Each map has at least two bases - one for the green team, and one for the yellow (red in the PC version) team. Initially, the base locations were hidden from the players, so an extensive search of the landscape had to be conducted first.
Nonetheless, many players chose to rampage around the map, simply blasting away. Obstacles included enemy [[Gun turret|turret]]s spread around the map, various fortifications and destructible buildings. If the player stood still for too long (to set up an ambush, for instance), a series of enemy helicopters would appear from off screen and attack. The helicopters could be shot down with the tank's main weapon.

===Bases and tanks=== 
Each base has several different types of buildings, such as armories, barracks, and bio-domes. The objective is to [[capture the flag]] from inside the enemy base by blasting through walls and destroying any defenses. You could also rescue [[prisoners of war]] by destroying the POW camps that were scattered throughout the enemy base. Destroying the camps would allow the captives to hop in your tank for a ride back to your base. An extra tank life is rewarded for each fifteen POWs rescued.<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/fire-power/screenshots/gameShotId,46234/ Screenshot] at MobyGames.com showing pre-game instructions: "Lives: Each game starts with five tank lives. One additional life is added each time fifteen men are rescued (unloaded at a friendly first-aid station.)"</ref>

Three different tanks are available: one is fast and fragile, one is slow but strong, and the third is rated in between the two. Each tank could carry a different amount of POWs. To capture the enemy flag, you had to carefully maneuver your tank into the flag building and drive over the enemy flag to pick it up. Your weapons could not destroy garages.

===Features===
The game includes the ability to run over enemy soldiers, crushing them with an accompanying "squish" sound effect and a bloody "splat" that remains on the battlefield for several minutes.  A map editor allows creation of custom multiplayer experiences.

''Fire Power'' can be played alone, against a human opponent on a split screen, or over a [[modem]], which allowed players to chat with each other while playing.

==Reception==
Roy Wagner reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "I find Fire Power to be a fair priced design with exceptional presentation. In other words, it is a great shoot 'em up arcade wargame."<ref name="CGW42">{{cite magazine |last=Wagner |first=Roy |title=Fire Power |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=December 1987 |volume=1 |issue=42 |pages=51}}</ref>
