'''''500cc Grand Prix''''', one of the first French-made games, is a motorcycle [[racing game]] developed by [[Microïds]] and released in 1987<ref>{{Cite web |title=500 cc Grand Prix |url=https://videogamegeek.com/videogame/298038/500-cc-grand-prix |access-date=2022-05-02 |website=VideoGameGeek |language=en-US}}</ref> on multiple platforms, including the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MS-DOS|Microsoft DOS]], [[Commodore 64]], and the [[Atari ST]]. The game included a multiplayer mode, considered by magazines to be the technology of the future.<ref>{{Cite web |first= |title=Tilt Magazine #043, Page 35 |url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Tilt/tilt_numero043/TILT%20043%20-%20page035.JPG |access-date=29 September 2022 |website=Abandonware.org |language=French}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Génération 4 Magazine #001, Page 30 |url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Generation%204/generation4_numero001/Generation4%20001%20-%20Page%20030%20(1987-Q4).jpg |access-date=29 September 2022 |website=Abandonware.org |language=French}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2023}}
The game provides a two-player [[Split screen (computing)|split-screen mode]] and three levels of general difficulty. Players can choose between the training mode, a single Grand Prix, or the World Championship.

During a race, the screen is split into two vertical halves showing the point of view of two racers. In single-player mode, one screen has the player's motorcycle, while the other has a motorcycle controlled by the computer. In two-player mode, each player is given one side of the screen. The camera is positioned in the [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third person perspective]] behind the bike, with a [[HUD (video gaming)|Heads Up Display]] showing various indicators. The controls consist of accelerating, braking, steering (pushed at two different inclinations), and gear changing between the four available gears. In the event of an accident or crash, the player is penalized and will restart immediately from a stationary position where they crashed.

In training mode, there are only two laps and two racers per circuit; contrary to a single Grand Prix, there are nine laps and six racers — four racers for the C64 version — for each circuit. The game contains a total of twelve available circuits, inspired by those of real life. In the [[Microsoft DOS|DOS]] and [[Atari ST]] versions, there is a [[Saved game|save mode]] after every race.

In the World Championship mode, the player or players must run all twelve circuits with the aim of obtaining a final classification or score based on their placements across all twelve races. Similar to the Grand Prix mode, each circuit contains nine laps with six participating motorcycles — again, with the C64 having four — and there is a save mode after each race in the DOS and Atari ST versions.

==Reception==
