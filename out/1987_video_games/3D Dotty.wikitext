'''''3D Dotty''''' is a [[List of maze video games|maze video game]] written by J.L. Harris and published by [[Blue Ribbon (software house)|Blue Ribbon]] for the [[Acorn Electron]] and [[BBC Micro]] [[home computer]]s in 1987.<ref name=bbc/> Each screen consists of vertically stacked mazes connected by ladders. The goal is to collect all of the dots while avoiding a fungus.

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2020}}

Contact with the fungus reduces energy, and a life is lost when the energy reaches zero. The fungus can be blocked, but only three blocks are permitted at any one time. On completing a screen bonus points are given proportional to the amount of energy remaining. Extra lives are awarded when the score reaches 5,000 and 10,000 points.

There are eight different screens. After the eighth, the screens are repeated, but energy is reduced by two units upon contact with the fungus. A practice mode allows trying any of the screens.
