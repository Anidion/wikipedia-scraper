''Throne of Fire'' is an [[Action game|action]] [[Strategy video game|strategy]] game. Set in the Burning Citadel, located around the rim of a volcano, the player assumes the role of one of the three princes of the recently deceased King Atherik: Alorn the Lion Prince, Cordrin the Sun Prince, and Karag the Wolf Prince.<ref name="Instructions">{{cite book|title=Throne of Fire Instruction Manual|publisher=Consult Computer Systems|date=1986|last=Singleton|first=Mike|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/t/ThroneOfFire.txt|access-date=2017-06-15|archive-date=2015-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907234424/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/t/ThroneOfFire.txt|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="CVG2"/> As one of the princes, the player can play against two computer players or a second player and a computer player, who play the role of the other two princes. Each prince and their [[men-at-arms]] must fight the other princes and their army to the death. The player must also fight against the King's Guard, the protectors of the Throne of Fire. Weapons with their own strengths and weaknesses can be found around the castle, along with magical objects that can increase or decrease a character's strength.<ref name="Instructions"/><ref name="CVG1"/>

Each army group are distinguished by color, with Prince Alorn and his men as red, Cordrin as yellow, Karag as purple, and the King's Guard as green. The castle has one hundred rooms to enter through. If any characters enter a room, their group color will light up the room. Each of the princes starts with nine men-at-arms. Reinforcements will join the side of whoever last visited Gate Rooms. If no one entered a Gate Room before the man-at-arms appears, they will join the King's Guard.<ref name="CVG2"/><ref name="SU"/>

Once the player enters the Throne Room with their prince, they become the king and take control of the King's Guard. The other players lose the ability to control their men-at-arms, with their men staying in their rooms to defend themselves. If the new king dies, the King's Guard will return to being neutral and the other princes regain their men.<ref name="CVG2"/><ref name="CVG1">{{cite magazine|title=Street Seen|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|page=101|issue=65|date=June 1987|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-video-games-magazine-065/CVG065_Mar_1987#page/n99/mode/2up}}</ref><ref name="SU"/>

Ben Stone, Paul Sumner, and Ricky Eddy from [[Crash (magazine)|''Crash'']] were more critical of the gameplay, as they considered the game to be too easy to play in single-player, with all three recommending the two-player mode. Stone added that the lack of difficulty spoiled the gameplay. Eddy also criticized the game for lacking the compulsion and depth Mike Singleton's other games had.<ref name="CRASH"/> Judy Daniel from ''[[Sinclair User]]'' called the gameplay "dodgy" and thought it was not one of Singleton's best games.<ref name="SU"/> A reviewer for ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' was more negative towards the game. While saying that the game had interesting ideas in it, they did not think that the ideas worked together. ''Computer Gamer'' also called the action on screen confusing and considered the game to be "tedious" overall.<ref name="CG"/>
