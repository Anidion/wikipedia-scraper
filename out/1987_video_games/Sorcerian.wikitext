{{nihongo foot|'''''Sorcerian'''''|ソーサリアン|Sōsarian}} is a 1987 [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[Nihon Falcom]] as the fifth installment in the ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' line of games. Originally released for the PC-8801 Personal Computer, it has since been released on a wide variety of platforms.

==Gameplay==
''Sorcerian'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] action-RPG. The player can create up to ten characters, from whom up to four members can be present in a party at the same time. Each character is highly customizable, with four different classes/races (fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf) and over 60 possible jobs/occupations (ranging from clown to exorcist) available for them to perform; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, affecting the seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, protection, magic resistance, vitality, dexterity, and karma) in different ways,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=20094|title=Sorcerian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010101/https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=20094|archive-date=2014-01-01|url-status=dead|website=[[All Media Network#AllGame|AllGame]]}}</ref> as well as different equipment limitations.<ref name=GameCola/>

The player can choose from fifteen different scenarios, or [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]], to play through in the order of their [[Nonlinear gameplay|choice]]. The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison.<ref name=GameCola/><ref>{{cite news|author=Kurt Kalata|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragonslayer/dragonslayer.htm|title=Dragon Slayer|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=2011-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120074448/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragonslayer/dragonslayer.htm|archive-date=2018-01-20|url-status=live}}</ref> The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[Shooter game|shooter]] ''[[Gradius]]'' (1985).<ref name="gamasutra_ds"/> ''Sorcerian'' also employs class-based [[Puzzle game|puzzles]], such as using a high-strength character to force open doors.<ref name=GameCola>[http://gamecola.net/2010/10/sorcerian-pc/ Sorcerian (PC)], ''GameCola.net'', October 30, 2010 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122162343/http://gamecola.net/2010/10/sorcerian-pc/ |date=November 22, 2010}}</ref>

All the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an "Advance Time" to speed up the flow of time. Another new feature of ''Sorcerian'' was its [[Episodic video game|episodic]] format that extended across various [[expansion pack]]s. Besides the default fifteen scenarios that come with the game, there were a number of additional scenario packs released. The aging system was created with the additional scenario packs in mind.<ref name=GameCola/>

== Release ==
It was originally released for the [[NEC PC-8801]] in 1987, and was later ported to other [[personal computer]] platforms such as the [[NEC PC-9801]], the [[NEC PC-88VA]], the [[X1 (computer)|Sharp X1 Turbo]], and the [[MSX2]], for which it was released under the title '''''Dragon Slayer V: Sorcerian'''''. An English version for [[MS-DOS]] was published by [[Sierra Entertainment]] in 1990, ports for the [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[Apple IIGS]] and [[Macintosh]] platforms were announced,<ref>{{cite journal|date=September 1989|title=News and new products|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|issue=149|pages=79–80 [80]}}</ref> but not released.

In [[2000 in video gaming|2000]], Falcom released ''Sorcerian Original'', a [[Video game remake|remake]] of Sorcerian for Microsoft Windows-based PCs.

==Add-ons==
A number of add-on [[expansion pack]]s containing new [[Episodic video game|scenarios]] were developed for the PC-8801 version of ''Sorcerian'', by both Falcom themselves and by other companies:

*'''Developed by Falcom:''' ''Sorcerian Utility Vol. 1, Sorcerian Additional Scenario Vol. 1, Sorcerian Additional Scenario Vol. 2 – Sengoku Sorcerian, Sorcerian Additional Scenario Vol. 3 – Pyramid Sorcerian''
*'''Developed by Amorphous:''' ''Sorcerian New Scenario Vol. 1 – The Visitor from Outer Space, Selected Sorcerian 1, Selected Sorcerian 2, Selected Sorcerian 3, Selected Sorcerian 4, Selected Sorcerian 5''
*'''Developed by Quasar Soft:''' ''Gilgamesh Sorcerian''

==Music==
The soundtrack to the original ''Sorcerian'' was composed by [[Yuzo Koshiro]], Mieko Ishikawa, Reiko Takebayashi, Hideya Nagata, and Takahito Abe. The Falcom-developed ''Additional Scenarios'' were handled solely by Ishikawa. The music for the original ''Sorcerian'' was arranged by [[Kenji Kawai]] for the [[PC Engine CD]] release. Rob Atesalp and Ken Allen converted the original score to be a [[Roland MT-32#Music for PC games|MT-32 MIDI-compatible]] arrangement of the soundtrack for Sierra Entertainment's English version of the game.

Soundtrack releases for ''Sorcerian'' include:
*'''''Music from Sorcerian''''': The original score to the PC-88 version of the game.
*'''''All Sounds of Sorcerian''''': The original sound again, this time in the form of medleys for each scenario, along with two arranged tracks.
*'''''Sorcerian Super Arrange Version''''': A series of three albums featuring arrangements by [[Hiroyuki Namba]]. Volume 1 contains a set of arrangements from the base scenario of Sorcerian. Volume 2 contains arrangements from the base scenario and Additional Scenario Vol. 1, along with the original sound of Additional Scenario Vol. 1. Volume 3 contains arrangements and the original sound from Additional Scenario Vol. 2 and Vol. 3.
*'''''Perfect Collection Sorcerian''''': A set of 3 2-disc albums containing various arrangements of the base Sorcerian soundtrack, similar to the ''Perfect Collection [[Ys]]'' album series.
*'''''Sorcerian Forever I & II''''': Two albums containing upgraded versions of the Sorcerian base scenario soundtrack, similar to the ''Music from Ys Renewal'' releases.

==Reception==
In 1990, ''[[Famitsu|Famicom Tsūshin]]'' (now ''Famitsu'') reviewed [[Sega Mega Drive]] (Genesis) version of the game, giving it a generally positive score of 27 out of 40.<ref name="famitsu_sega">{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=934 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081315/http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=934 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the July 1990 edition of ''[[Games International]]'' (issue 16), Theo Clarke was disappointed in this game, calling the animation "rudimentary", and that there was "little realism in the game". He thought it was far more an arcade game than a role-playing game, and awarded it a below average rating of only 6 out of 10, calling it "a well-preserved museum piece".<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine| last=Clarke| first=Theo| date=July 1990 |title=Computer Games|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=16|pages=45}}</ref>

In the October 1991 edition of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] noted it has "an interesting feature or two" and liked the game's division into many miniquests, stating that instead "of the usual long adventure, this one sports fifteen separate small quests" which "allows for a certain amount of variety". However, she disliked the magic system, and stated "the action is [[Arcade game|arcade]] in style, which is typical for a Japanese game, and some will find this irksome" but noted "this is not just [[Hack and slash|hack-and-slash]], as there are [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]] to be solved along the way". Scorpia concluded that ''Sorcerian'' was a "good for a change of pace" for those comfortable with [[Action role-playing game|"arcade" action]].<ref name="scorpia199110">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 | title=C*R*P*G*S / Computer Role-Playing Game Survey | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Scorpia | pages=16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224200/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 | archive-date=2 December 2013 | url-status=live}}</ref>

During production of [[PlatinumGames]] title ''[[Scalebound]]'', game designer [[Hideki Kamiya]] said he was inspired by ''Sorcerian'' as well as ''[[Hydlide 3]]''. He noted the influence of ''Sorcerian''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fantasy theme, "gigantic monsters", different scenarios, "expansive possibilities", "tons of adventures" and enemies such as a hydra boss and "lots of amazing dragons".<ref>{{cite news|last=Leone|first=Matthew|date=|title=Hideki Kamiya: Making Scalebound with a Western publisher|url=http://www.polygon.com/a/life-in-japan/Hideki-Kamiya-Scalebound|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025064209/http://www.polygon.com/a/life-in-japan/Hideki-Kamiya-Scalebound|archive-date=2015-10-25|access-date=2015-11-01|website=Polygon}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McCaffrey|first=Ryan|date=August 26, 2015|title=Ask PlatinumGames Anything About Scalebound|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/ask-platinumgames-anything-about-scalebound|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224121627/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/ask-platinumgames-anything-about-scalebound|archive-date=2015-12-24|access-date=2015-12-19|website=IGN}}</ref>
