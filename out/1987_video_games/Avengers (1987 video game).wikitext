'''''Avengers''''', sometimes known as '''''Avenger''''' and known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Hissatsu Buraiken'''''|必殺 無頼拳||lit. "Deadly Ruffian Fist"}}, is a 1986 overhead-view [[vertical scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Capcom]]. The game was directed by [[Takashi Nishiyama]], who previously designed the [[side-scrolling]] beat 'em ups ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' (1984) and ''[[Trojan (video game)|Trojan]]'' (1986), and later designed the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' (1987) and several early [[SNK]] [[fighting games]].

==Gameplay==

The game takes place in Paradise City, where the villain, "Geshita", has captured 6 girls from the city. The player's objective (as Ryu or Ko) is to banish "Geshita" from Paradise City once and for all. During the game, the player can pick up powerups like the "Speed Up", the Super Punch, [[Grenade]]s, [[Shuriken]]s, [[Nunchaku]] and extra health. The game also features hidden areas on each level, accessed by breaking doors in structures on either side of the screen. The player's character has 3 normal means of attack: Punches, which are quick with short range, Kicks, which are slower with longer range, and the Roundhouse, which hits in a 360 degree motion.

==Ports and related releases==
''Avengers'' was later included in ''[[Capcom Classics Collection]]: Remixed'' for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] and ''Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. It was one of the initial games available for download in ''[[Capcom Arcade Cabinet]]'', a compilation digitally released for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in February 2013.
