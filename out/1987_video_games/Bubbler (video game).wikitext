'''''Bubbler''''' is a [[ZX Spectrum]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Ultimate Play the Game]] in 1987. It was Ultimate's final release for 8-bit home computers before evolving into [[Rare (company)|Rare]]. The game is an isometric [[platform game]] in the style of ''[[Marble Madness]]'' (1984).<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/41/bubbler.htm|title=CRASH 41 - Bubbler|last=Stone|first=Paul Sumner/Glancey(?), Richard Eddy, Ben|website=crashonline.org.uk|access-date=2017-12-25}}</ref>

==Development==
A [[Commodore 64]] version was outsourced to Lynsoft but the release was cancelled as Ultimate thought the game was running too slowly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/the-bubbler/|title=The Bubbler (C64) - 1987 Ultimate Play The Game - GTW64|date=7 June 1987|website=Games That Weren't|accessdate=7 June 2023}}</ref>

== Reception ==
''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' magazine reviewer Ricky disliked the impreciseness of the controls.<ref name="auto"/> ''Sinclair User'' were more impressed by the game; they did not consider it to be one of Ultimate's most original game or particularly well presented but thought it was very addictive. It was awarded a 5 star rating.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sinclair User |url=https://wholeapk.com/ |website=worldofspectrum.org |access-date=3 September 2023 |archive-date=3 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230903100831/https://wholeapk.com/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>
