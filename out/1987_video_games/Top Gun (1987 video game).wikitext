''Top Gun'' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[combat flight simulation game]],<ref name=ACE/><ref name=CVG/><ref name=Total/> viewed from a first-person perspective inside the cockpit of an [[F-14]] fighter plane.<ref name=AG/> The game is based on the 1986 hit film ''[[Top Gun]]'', and is played across four levels, each one involving the player fighting off enemy [[MiGs]]. In the second level, the player must also destroy an enemy [[aircraft carrier]]. For the final two levels respectively, the player's target is an enemy fortress and a space shuttle on a launch pad (the last mission occurs at night). The player has three lives in the form of F-14 planes. All three planes being destroyed yields [[game over]] with no [[Continue (video games)|continue]].<ref name=AG/><ref name=ACE/><ref name=CVG/><ref name=TGM/>

The player has unlimited machine gun ammunition and three different types of missile, each one with their own advantages. MiGs also have their own missiles, which the player must avoid or destroy. The player is presented with onscreen information such as altitude, air speed, a radar, and a fuel gauge. Once during each level, the player can call in a [[Aerial refueling|tanker plane]] to refuel the F-14 if necessary. Refueling is done in mid-air, and the player must align the F-14 with the fuel pump. After each level, the player must successfully land the F-14 on a U.S. aircraft carrier.<ref name=AG/><ref name=ACE/><ref name=CVG/><ref name=TGM/>

''Top Gun'' was a commercial hit. It was the top-selling game in the United States for two weeks in January 1988.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=19 February 1988|title=U.S.A. TOP 10: 2月5日|trans-title=U.S.A.

Lacey called it an "excellent" flight game addition to the NES library.<ref name=CVG/> ''[[The Games Machine]]'' stated that like most NES games, ''Top Gun'' had an emphasis on playability rather than graphical presentation. The magazine described the graphics as "little more than a detailed cockpit and fast moving enemies", but stated that the game succeeded in playability with its levels. ''The Games Machine'' added that the landing and refueling segments, and the necessary missile strategy, help to "spruce up the action".<ref name=TGM/>

Steve Jarratt of ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' praised the sound effects and wrote that ''Top Gun'' "is visually sparse but the sprites are extremely effective – especially in the air-to-air combat". Jarratt praised the large amount of "varied and entertaining" action, and stated that the game would appeal to fans of shoot 'em up games.<ref name=ACE/> German magazine ''Power Play'' criticized the gameplay's lack of playful variety.<ref name=PP/> Ulrich Mühl of ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' praised the graphics and sound.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Mühl |first=Ulrich |date=January 1989 |title=Es "burnert" auf dem Nintendo |magazine=Aktueller Software Markt |location=Germany |language=German |pages=72–73}}</ref> French magazine ''Player One'' said the graphics were good for an NES game.<ref name=PO/>

''[[Total!]]'' reviewed the game in 1993, and considered the gameplay too simplistic because the levels were too few and similar, but found variety in the landing and refueling segments. The magazine concluded, "While ''Top Gun''{{'}}s a fun blast, it hasn't got any lasting pull."<ref name=Total/> In a later review for the website ''[[AllGame]]'', Christopher Michael Baker praised the graphics and realistic sound effects, and stated that it was arguably the best air warfare game ever released for the NES. However, Baker stated that it also offered much frustration with its difficulty. Baker cited three primary reasons for the difficulty, including the split-second decisions required in determining whether to avoid or destroy missiles, and the lack of continues. Baker also cited the landing and refueling segments, writing that they require "a soft touch and total concentration", and that they are "difficult, if not impossible, to master".<ref name=AG/>
