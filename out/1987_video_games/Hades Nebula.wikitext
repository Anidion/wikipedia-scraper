'''''Hades Nebula''''' is a 1987 [[scrolling shooter|vertically scrolling shooter]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Atari ST]] by Paranoid Software and published by Nexus Productions. The player controls an upgradable fighter that must battle its way through thousands of enemy ships before it confronts the final boss, Emperor Hades. There are fifteen levels.

==Gameplay==

Enemies are face-like ships or bug-like ships that materialise at certain points in the game. Upon appearance they immediately seek out the player's ship and collide with it unless evasive action is taken. Also, every one or two levels or so, 'mother ship' bosses are encountered that take a considerable amount of bullet dodging and incisive shots to destroy.

There are two sound options while playing the game: either sound effects or the musical soundtrack by [[Ben Daglish]]. The latter is the default mode, and changes depending on whether you are fighting a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] or charging through a level.

==Development==
''Hades Nebula'' was developed by Paranoid Software: Darren Melbourne, Mark Greenshields and Ned Langman.<ref name=retro>{{cite magazine|title=From The Archives: Nexus Productions|first=Richard|last=Hewison|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=10 June 2021|issue=222|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/retro-gamer/20210610/281578063589940|access-date=5 October 2023|publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref> Ben Daglish provided the music for the [[Commodore 64]] version, while John Brozovski made the sound effects for the [[Atari ST]].<ref name=screenseen />
