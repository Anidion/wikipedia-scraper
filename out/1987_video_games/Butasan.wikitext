{{nihongo|'''''Butasan'''''|ぶたさん}} (also known as '''''Mr. Pig''''' and '''''Pig and Bombers''''') is a [[arcade video game]] developed by [[NMK (company)|NMK]] and [[Jaleco]] and released in 1987. It was ported to the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]], and [[Amstrad CPC]] by [[U.S. Gold]] as '''''Psycho Pigs U.X.B.'''''<ref>[http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/psychopigsuxb.htm Psycho Pigs U.X.B. review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315055938/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/psychopigsuxb.htm# |date=2009-03-15 }} at ysrnry.co.uk</ref>

==Gameplay==

The player controls a pig and the aim of the game is to blow up other pigs by throwing bombs at them. The bombs are randomly spawned across the map and can be picked up and thrown at the other pigs. The bombs are given a number between 5 and 30; when the bomb is thrown it takes that number of seconds to explode. Bombs which directly hit pigs explode on contact. Various power ups are available throughout the game such as gas that makes all other characters fall asleep.

A bonus sub-game involves random pigs popping out of holes, and the player must knock them back down the hole with their own pig, in a similar mode of gameplay to Whack-a-mole.

There were several criticisms of [[sexism]] when an advert of the game showing a semi-naked model holding the video game case was published in some specialized magazines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vgprintads.tumblr.com/post/116389449425/psycho-pigs-uxb-butasan-home-computer|title=Video Game Print Ads • "Psycho Pigs U.X.B. / Butasan" [Home Computer]...|website=Video Game Print Ads|date=April 2015|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref>Image of the polemical advert: {{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesdatabase.org/media/commodore-64/artwork-advert/psycho-pigs-uxb|title=Psycho Pigs UXB - Commodore 64 - Artwork - Advert|last=|first=|date=|website=Games Database|publisher=Spesoft|access-date=2023-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzaprrapsexism.html|title=Zzap Rrap - Psycho Pigs UXB Advert|website=www.zzap64.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>
