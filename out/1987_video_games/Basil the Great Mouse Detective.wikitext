'''''Basil the Great Mouse Detective''''' is a [[Platform game|platform]], [[action-adventure game]] designed by Bob Armour and published by [[Gremlin Graphics]] in 1987 for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], and [[Commodore 64]].<ref name="giantlist"/> The game is based on the 1986 [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated film ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''.

==Plot==
The protagonist of the game is a mouse named Basil who resides in the basement of the fabled [[221b Baker Street]] home of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. The evil Professor Ratigan has abducted Basil's friend Dr. Dawson, and he now has to scour [[London]] for hints that will help him find the villain's hideout. 

==Gameplay==

The player controls Basil by walking around the chambers, passing from one to another through the edges of the screen (if possible) or squeezing through letter slots and other holes in the walls. In the locations, in addition to numerous enemies, there are various objects. Most of them are just decorations, but in each level there are at least two types of containers in which Basil can find items. So when the player spots a container, bin, jar or something similar they should search it. Once the player has collected all the evidence in a level, they need to find the passage to the next stage, which was previously masked. The above steps must be repeated until the game is completed, and there are a total of 3 levels: London's shops and docks, the sewers and finally the hideout of the evil Ratigan.
