{{Nihongo|'''''A-Jax'''''|エー・ジャックス}} is a [[scrolling shooter|vertically scrolling shooter]] released in arcades by [[Konami]] in December 1987. There was a European release of the game called '''''Typhoon''''', which is the name used for [[Imagine Software]]'s [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Commodore 64]] ports.

The players control a "Tom Tiger" [[helicopter]] (in the [[2D computer graphics|2D]] stage) and later a "Jerry Mouse" [[fighter aircraft|fighter jet]] (in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] stage), and shoot enemies in the air and bomb them on the ground, collecting [[power-up]]s and defeating [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance levels.

The game takes place in a fictional 2007, where an unnamed nuclear superpower had been working with aliens to construct an artificial planetoid. However, the aliens betrayed and invaded the superpower, cutting off all communication with the rest of the world, then beginning a conquest of the planet. Determined to prevent the aliens from using the planetoid to deploy nuclear weapons with impunity, the United Nations deploy the elite strike force A-Jax to cripple the alien campaign and destroy the planetoid.

The player combats the occupation forces using vehicles under operation code named 'A-Jax' created to liberate the Earth. Game play is divided into two scrolling sections with two different vehicles: the first being a vertical scrolling section with the helicopter and a Rail scrolling stage with the jet/space fighter. The game spans eight stages and extends to 30,000 points, a second at 150,000 points.

During the helicopter segments, the player has access to four different weapons air-to-air weapons (Vulcan, 3-Way, Triple, Laser) and air-to-ground bombs. Each air-to-air weapon is available through their own specific pick-up icon, while picking up a B upgrades the bombs' speed and power. However, the helicopter can only equip one air-to-air weapon at a time, with the Bomb being constant. The player also has access to Options which add additional firepower. The jet segments contrast highly from the helicopter segments--they have a complete lack of available power-ups and additional weapons beyond a machine gun and bomb.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''A-Jax'' on their January 15, 1988 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=324|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 January 1988|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>
