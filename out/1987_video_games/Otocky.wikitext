{{nihongo|'''''Otocky'''''|オトッキー}} is a [[video game]] released in 1987 for the [[Family Computer Disk System]] in Japan.<ref name= siliconeraotocky>[http://www.siliconera.com/index.php/otocky/ siliconera.com: Otocky by Katie Montminy] Retrieved July 30, 2006 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311005951/http://www.siliconera.com/index.php/otocky/ |date=March 11, 2007}}</ref> Developed by SEDIC and published by [[ASCII Corporation]], the game was conceived and designed by [[Toshio Iwai]]. [[Natsuki Ozawa]] endorsed the game.

==Gameplay==
''Otocky'' can be described as a [[Music video game|musical]] [[side-scrolling]] [[shoot 'em up]]. The player's spaceship has a ball for a weapon, which can be fired in eight directions; each direction corresponds to a different musical note. The note plays when the player presses the fire button, and is also [[Quantization (music)|quantized]] in time so that it matches the beat playing in the background. By using the weapon selectively the player can improvise music while playing.

The ball is used to destroy enemies by touching them, and also to catch various types of objects:

* Musical Notes which must be collected to finish the level.
* Letter 'A's which change the musical instrument sound produced by the ball.
* Letter 'B's which provide a secondary weapon.

The ball gets smaller when the player is touched by an enemy, until the player loses a life.

Completing a certain number of levels unlocks a music editor which makes it possible for the player to freely compose their own melodies.

==Legacy==
''Otocky'' is notable for being one of the first games that include ''creative/procedural'' [[generative music]], as well as developing the concept of the "musical shoot 'em up".

''Otocky'' is a precursor of ''[[Rez (video game)|Rez]]'', [[Tetsuya Mizuguchi]]'s 2002 [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]] game exploring similar themes of player action and musical evolution.<ref name=handcircusotocky>[http://www.handcircus.com/2006/07/26/ode-to-otocky-by-toshio-iwai/ handcircus.com: Ode to "Otocky" (by Toshio Iwai) (July 26, 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928043028/http://www.handcircus.com/2006/07/26/ode-to-otocky-by-toshio-iwai/ |date=September 28, 2007}} Retrieved July 30, 2006</ref> Jake Kazdal, the only North-American member of [[United Game Artists]], has confirmed that while the team did become acquainted with the Disk System game during the process of creating ''Rez'', it has not been much of an influence in fact.<ref name="An American Gaijin">[http://coregamer.web.simplesnet.pt/kazdaleng2.htm Jake Kazdal: An American Gaijin - A CoreGamers Interview (September 16, 2008)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123004837/http://coregamer.web.simplesnet.pt/kazdaleng2.htm |date=January 23, 2013}} Retrieved January 06, 2009</ref>
