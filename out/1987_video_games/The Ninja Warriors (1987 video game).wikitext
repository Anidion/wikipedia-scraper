{{nihongo|'''''The Ninja Warriors'''''|ニンジャウォーリアーズ}} is a [[side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] video game developed and released by [[Taito]] in 1987. The original [[arcade game]] situated one display in between projected images of two other displays, creating the appearance of a triple-wide screen. Ports were released for home systems including the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[PC Engine]], and [[Sega Mega-CD]].

A sequel with the same name, ''[[The Ninja Warriors (1994 video game)|The Ninja Warriors]]'', was developed by [[Natsume (company)|Natsume]] and released in 1994, followed by its enhanced remaster ''[[The Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors]]'' released in 2019.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC The Ninja Warriors.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]

''The Ninja Warriors'' presents side-scrolling hand-to-hand combat. Players take control of [[Kunoichi]] (player 1) or [[Ninja]] (player 2) and fight wave after wave of Banglar forces across six levels. Button 1 attacks with a short-range [[kunai]] slash, while button 2 fires long-range [[shuriken]]s that are limited in supply.

==Plot==
The game is set in a dystopian future where Banglar, the [[President of the United States]] in 1993, has declared martial law nationwide.<ref name=crash>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue72/Pages/Crash7200052.jpg ''Crash'', Issue 1.90, page 52.]</ref> A group of anarchist scientists led by Mulk decide that it is time to revolt against the government. Knowing full well that fighting the military themselves would be suicidal, the scientists create two powerful androids to carry out the mission for them. The robots, code-named "Kunoichi" (red female) and "Ninja" (blue male), are sent by the scientists to end Banglar's tyranny once and for all.

==Development and release==
The game's arcade cabinet is unique due to its three contiguous screens (one screen in the usual place for an arcade game, and two more screens in the cabinet below, reflected by mirrors on either side of the middle screen) which created the effect of a single 4:1 screen akin to the [[Polyvision]] fomat used in [[Abel Gance]]'s [[Napoléon (1927 film)|''Napoléon (1927)'']], depicting ninjas.<ref name=ys>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue49/Pages/YourSinclair4900091.jpg ''Your Sinclair'', Issue 1.90, page 91.]</ref> The same cabinet was also used for ''[[Darius (arcade game)|Darius]]'' and ''[[Darius II (video game)|Darius II]]'' and [[Konami]] used a similar format for its ''[[X-Men (arcade game)|X-Men]]'' arcade release (six players). The music was composed by [[Hisayoshi Ogura]] and Taito's in-house band [[Zuntata]]. [[Pony Canyon]] and [[Scitron]] released the two [[soundtrack]]s for the game in 1988 and 1991,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vgmdb.net/album/1239 |title=D28B-0001 &#124; The Ninjawarriors -G.S.M.

The game was [[porting|ported]] to various personal computers: the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum|Sinclair Spectrum 128K]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. [[Home console]] versions of the game were released exclusively in Japan for the [[NEC PC Engine]] and [[Sega Mega-CD]].
A version for the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' series on the [[PlayStation 4]] was released in September 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0571-CUSA05116_00-HAMPRDC000000001|title=Playstation Store -- Arcade Archives: The Ninja Warrior|accessdate=2018-09-05}}</ref> A new port based on the 1994 version titled ''The Ninja Warriors: Once Again'' was released in 2019 on [[Nintendo Switch]].

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''The Ninja Warriors'' on their April 1, 1988 issue as being the third most-successful upright arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=329|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 April 1988|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref> It went on to become Japan's eighth highest-grossing dedicated [[1988 in video games|arcade game of 1988]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25: '88 ''/ "Game of the Year '88" By Game Machine'' |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=348 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]] |date=15 January 1989 |pages=10–1, 26 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19890115p.pdf#page=6}}</ref>

The arcade game received positive reviews. Clare Edgeley of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reviewed the arcade game upon release, noted that it was one of several popular "[[martial arts]] simulation" games at [[London]]'s [[Amusement Trades Exhibition International]] (ATEI) show in January 1988, along with [[Sega]]'s ''[[Shinobi (1987 video game)|Shinobi]]'' and [[Data East]]'s ''[[Vigilante (video game)|Vigilante]]''; she said it plays similarly to ''Shinobi'', but that ''Ninja Warriors'' has a three-monitor cabinet like ''[[Darius (video game)|Darius]]'' (1986). She praised the large screen, "great" graphics, and fun gameplay, but said ''Shinobi'' and ''Vigilante'' were more challenging.<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=February 1988 |issue=77 (March 1988) |pages=90–3 |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-077/page/n89/mode/2up}}</ref> Nick Kelly of ''[[Commodore User]]'' rated it 8 out of 10, also noting similarities to ''Shinobi'', but preferring ''Ninja Warriors'' for its graphics and large screen. He said it was highly playable, "gorgeous looking" and technologically "a successful step" forwards.<ref name="CU">{{cite magazine |last=Kelly |first=Nick |title=Arcades: Ninja Warriors |magazine=[[Commodore User]] |date=6 May 1988 |issue=54 (June 1988) |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/268/244}}</ref> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' gave it a brief positive review, recommending readers to look "out for it."<ref name="YS33">{{cite magazine |last1=Smith |first1=Andy |title=Extended Play...

The home conversions also received mostly positive reviews, especially its 16-bit versions such as the ones for the Amiga. In 2010, [[CraveOnline]] featured the game (the arcade, SNES and Sega CD versions) on the list of top ten ninja games of all time.<ref>[http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/article/top-10-ninja-games-of-all-time-70885/3 Top 10 Ninja Games Of All Time] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128161834/http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/article/top-10-ninja-games-of-all-time-70885/3 |date=2011-01-28 }}, CraveOnline, September 18, 2008.</ref> In 2008, [[GamesRadar]] featured Kunoichi as the best assassin in the video game history: "She cut a memorable figure, rocking the huge blonde [[ponytail]] and bright-red ''[[Shinobi shōzoku|shozoku]]''.
