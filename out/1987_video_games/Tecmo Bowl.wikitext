{{nihongo|'''''Tecmo Bowl'''''|テクモボウル|Tekumo Bōru|lead=yes}} is an [[List of American football video games|American football video game]] developed and released by [[Tecmo]]. Originally released as an [[arcade game]] in 1987,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10043 |title=Tecmo Bowl |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate =October 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=1176|title=The Arcade Flyer Archive|website=Flyers.arcade-museum.com|accessdate=November 30, 2015}}</ref> the game features a large dual screen [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]] with up to four players between two fictitious teams. A [[Porting|port]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] was released in 1989 and was the first [[console game]] to include real [[National Football League]] players, via a license from the [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]]. A Game Boy version developed by [[Sculptured Software]] followed in 1991. The NES version was extremely popular, spawning various sequels, starting with 1991's ''[[Tecmo Super Bowl]]''. The NES original has been cited as one of the best sports video games ever made. The NES and arcade versions have been re-released (without the NFLPA license) for various platforms, including mobile phones, the [[Virtual Console]], the [[NES Classic Edition]], and [[Nintendo Switch]].

==Gameplay==
The original arcade version is distinguished by a large two-monitor cabinet, support for up to four players, and the ability to break tackles. Only two fictional teams can be chosen: the Wildcats and the Bulldogs. Its [[2D computer graphics|2D graphics]] are more advanced than the NES version, with a larger [[List of color palettes|color palette]] and more detailed [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]].

The NES version allows two players to play rather than the arcade's four players. The player can choose between three modes: one-player, two-player, and coach. In one-player mode, the player picks a football team and plays against the computer. After every game that the player wins, it is given a password to continue their quest for the championship and the computer picks another team to play as, and the player stays with the original choice. In the two-player and coach modes, the player and another human will play one game but the players only choose the plays in the coach mode (which cannot be done in the arcade version).

In both versions, the playbook consists of only four offensive plays. When on defense, a player selects a play based on the anticipation of the offense's choice; if chosen correctly, it results in a collapse of the offensive line and well-covered receivers, therefore setting up either a potential [[quarterback sack|sack]] or an [[interception]].

Although featuring the names, rosters, and statistics of real [[National Football League]] (NFL) players from a mix of the [[1987 NFL season|1987]] and [[1988 NFL season|1988 seasons]], the gameplay limits how closely the video game players mimics real-life players. Unlike standard American football rules which have 11 players on each team, the arcade version only allows ten players on the field at a time and the NES version only allows nine for each. The offense tries to avoid the defense, and the defense tries to either avoid blockers, tackle the ball carrier, or intercept a pass.

===Teams===
''Tecmo Bowl'' contains twelve teams, each equipped with four plays. Most teams have two running plays and two passing plays. The exceptions are [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]] and [[Miami Dolphins|Miami]], who have three passing plays and one running play.

Tecmo was not able an obtain an NFL league license to use real team names, as that had been given to [[NFL (video game)|LJN's NFL video game for the NES]].<ref name="ign">{{cite web | url = http://cheats.ign.com/objects/007/007133.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040224075109/http://cheats.ign.com/objects/007/007133.html| url-status = dead| archive-date = February 24, 2004| title = Game overview (second reference)| publisher = [[IGN]] | date = | accessdate = 2011-10-14}}</ref> As a result, the teams in the game are identified solely by their home city or state. However, through the [[NFLPA]] license, each roster mimics that of the NFL team based out of the same city or state. ''Tecmo Bowl'' only uses players from twelve of the best and most popular teams of the time.

The teams featured in the game are [[Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis]], [[Miami Dolphins|Miami]], [[Cleveland Browns|Cleveland]], [[Denver Broncos|Denver]], [[Seattle Seahawks|Seattle]], [[Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles (Raiders)]], [[Washington Redskins|Washington]], [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]], [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]], [[New York Giants|New York (Giants)]], [[Chicago Bears|Chicago]], and [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota]].

Each team has a different level of effectiveness based on its personnel and play selection.

Two NES versions were released in the U.S. The first is identified by its black and gold seal of quality, [[Eric Dickerson]] as running back, and [[Albert Bentley]] as a kick returner for Indianapolis. The second is identified by its white and gold seal, Albert Bentley as running back, and [[Clarence Verdin]] as a kick returner. One year later, the Famicom version has many roster changes (from the same twelve teams available in the North American version) to reflect being released during the real [[1990 NFL season]].

==Reception and legacy==
''[[Sinclair User]]'' reviewed the arcade game in 1988, scoring it 8 out of 10. They called it a "superb" game that significantly improved on earlier American football games such as ''[[10 Yard Fight]]'' (1983).<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Coin Ops |magazine=[[Sinclair User]] |date=18 May 1988 |issue=75 (June 1988) |pages=82–3 |url=https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/sinclair-user/75#82}}</ref>

===Bo Jackson character===
[[Bo Jackson]]'s character in Tecmo Bowl was called the "greatest video game athlete of all-time" by ''[[ESPN]]''<ref name="ESPN">{{cite news |last1=Rovell |first1=Darren |title=Bo knows video games |url=https://www.espn.com/espngamer/story?id=1623293 |access-date=15 August 2023 |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2003-09-25}}</ref> and ''[[USA Today]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nesbitt |first1=Andy |title=Bo Jackson is easily the greatest video game athlete of all time |url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/04/bo-jackson-tecmo-bowl-best-video-game-athlete |access-date=15 August 2023 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Some gamers claimed that Jackson's character could run for as many as 1,000 yards in a single game.<ref name="ESPN" />

''TechTimes'' noted that the game's character of Bo Jackson was "[a]bsolutely, positively—and absurdly—unstoppable," reflecting the real Jackson's extraordinary athletic abilities. Players considered using Jackson as effectively cheating within the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/97976/20151021/bo-jackson-unstoppable-tecmo-bowl.htm|title=Remembering Bo Jackson's 'Tecmo Bowl' Dominance|work=Tech Times|date=21 October 2015}}</ref> [[Lawrence Taylor]]'s character was used similarly on defense.


===Tecmo Bowl Documentary===

A documentary feature about the best Tecmo Bowl players in the world was shot in 2022 by [[CJ Wallis]]. The film takes place in Omaha, Nebraska where the National Championship takes place every year and features Super Bowl winning quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] and SEC host [[Cole Cubelic]]. <ref>{{Citation |last=Wallis |first=C.
