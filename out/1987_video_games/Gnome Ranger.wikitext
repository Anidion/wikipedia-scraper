'''''Gnome Ranger''''' is a graphic adventure game designed by Peter Austin<ref name="giantlist"/> and released by [[Level 9 Computing|Level 9]] in 1987.<ref name="moby">{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/gnome-ranger|title=Gnome Ranger|publisher=mobygames.com|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> A still image is shown for each location, and the player enters text commands to move or interact.

==Plot==
The [[gnome]] Ingrid Bottomlow has displeased her family by her un-gnomelike behaviour, such as going off to university and getting an education. She has been teleported from her village by a faulty scroll, and must find her way backâ€¦

==Gameplay==

The game is a text adventure with limited graphics on some systems. It comes with a short novella by Peter McBride ("The Gnettlefield Journal") explaining Ingrid's predicament and setting the background to the story. Gameplay is similar to the earlier Level 9 adventure ''[[Knight Orc]]'', which uses the same game engine (KAOS). The player must explore the settings while collecting useful items and interacting with various [[non-player character]]s to solve puzzles and problems.

The game takes place in three areas, each characterized by the non-player characters Ingrid will meet. The first contains characters of an animal nature, the second of a vegetable nature, and the third of a mineral nature.

==Reception==
''Gnome Ranger'' received mostly positive reviews. ''[[Atari ST User]]'' magazine reviewer rated it 9/10 points overall, concluding: "I am convinced it is Level 9's best ever. It is funny, well-plotted, teasing, very friendly, but powerful, literate and big".<ref name="atariSTuser"/> Similarly, the review for ''[[ACE_(magazine)|ACE]]'' magazine also ended on a positive note: "Gnome Ranger has improved on Knight Orc in the puzzle stakes (more logical and enjoyable), the atmosphere (more enjoyable and less confusing), the plot (more comprehensible), and the characters (more interesting). You can't ask for much more than that".<ref name="ace"/>
