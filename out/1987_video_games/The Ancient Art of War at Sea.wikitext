'''''The Ancient Art of War at Sea''''' is a computer game developed by [[Broderbund]] and released for [[Macintosh]] and [[DOS]] in 1987 as a sequel to ''[[The Ancient Art of War]]''.

==Plot==
The player commands a fleet of ships in this naval-combat simulation which takes place in the late 18th century.

Controllable ship types include the [[Frigate#Super-heavy_frigates|44-gun frigate]] with 250 crew, [[Seventy-four (ship)|74-gun]] (including 10 [[carronade]]s) [[Ship of the line|ship-of-the-line]] with over 600 crew, and the [[First-rate|130-gun]] (including 22 [[carronade]]s) flagship with 875 crew.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Ancient_Art_Of_War_At_Sea_Manual|title=Apple Manual: The Ancient Art Of War At Sea – Manual}}</ref>

The player faces one of six opponents, each of which uses his own different strategy against the player. Five are historic: the [[Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Duke of Medina Sidonia]] (1588); [[Maarten Tromp|Martin [sic] Tromp]] (1639); [[Blackbeard]] (1718); [[John Paul Jones]] (1779); [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] (1805); and a fictitious opponent Thor Foote.<ref>{{cite web|author=<!--Not stated-->|date=2010|title=Download The Ancient Art of War at Sea – My Abandonware|url=https://www.myabandonware.com/game/the-ancient-art-of-war-at-sea-9v|access-date=28 January 2018|website=My Abandonware|publisher=Utopiaweb}}</ref>
