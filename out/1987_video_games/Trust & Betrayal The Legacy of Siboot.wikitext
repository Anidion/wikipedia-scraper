== Gameplay ==
The player, an alien creature named Vetvel, must compete with six other [[acolyte]]s (each a different alien species) for the Shepherdship. Each of these characters has a distinct personality. Each morning, the acolytes wake up knowing one of each of the three "auras" the others possess. They must trade knowledge with each other in order to try to gain enough knowledge for the "mind combat" that takes place every night, which is basically a fancy [[Rock paper scissors|Rock, Paper, Scissors]] game that depends on the aura counts for the players involved. The game is won when a player gets eight auras in all three categories. However, in giving away somebody's aura count, the player betrays that person, which angers them and may make them less likely to trade aura counts with the player. Therefore, a player has to know who to trust and who to betray, hence the title: ''Trust & Betrayal''.

If the player clicks and holds the mouse button on an icon (the game's abstraction of a word), one can see its meaning. The number of icons is small enough, and the pictures intuitive enough, that they can quickly be committed to memory.

The game uses an [[inverse parser]], a method for constructing sentences out of words while only presenting words that make sense for the given context. It also emphasizes facial expressions as form of feedback. Interludes appear through the game present the user with one of several choices which may affect the gameplay. To use an actual example from the game, if game designer Chris Crawford appears and lectures the player, and the player responds "Go to hell, Crawford!", then he or she loses some favor among the other characters, making the game harder to win.

== Development ==
"Siboot", the name of the first Shepherd, is a reversal of the syllables of "Bootsie", a cat which Crawford had. Bootsie had to be euthanized due to an irreparable injury to his jaw. Crawford suffered much grief while contemplating that he was unable to talk to Bootsie in order to try to comfort him before he had to be put down. One day while pondering this, Crawford had a flash of insight: his next game would be ''Talk to the Animals'', which evolved into the very different ''Trust & Betrayal''.

A preliminary [[IBM PC]] port was made but never finished.

Crawford considered ''Siboot'' the favorite of his games and "the game of which I'm most proud" due to its innovations and creativity.<ref name = "escapist" /><ref name="rouse"/>

''Siboot'' was poorly received in the marketplace and did not recoup its investment. It sold about 5,000 units on the [[Mac (computer)|Macintosh]].<ref name = "escapist">{{cite journal

In 2013 Crawford publicly released the [[source code]] of several of his games, including ''Trust & Betrayal''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmatazz.com/library/source-code/index.html| title=Source Code|quote=30 months ago, at the 2011 Game Developers Conference, somebody asked me to release the source code for my old games.

In January 2013, Crawford began work on a redesigned version of ''Siboot'', borrowing the world and premise of the 1987 game and taking advantage of advances in computer power.<ref>{{cite web
