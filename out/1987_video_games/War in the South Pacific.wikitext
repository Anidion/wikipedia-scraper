'''''War in the South Pacific''''' is a 1987 [[computer wargame]] designed by [[Gary Grigsby]] and published by [[Strategic Simulations]]. It is classified as a [[monster wargame]].

==Gameplay==
''War in the South Pacific'' is a [[computer wargame]] that simulates [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theatre]] conflicts during [[World War II]].<ref name=vgce /> It is classified as a [[monster wargame]],<ref name=cgwrev /> and allows sea, land and air combat. The title contains both historical and hypothetical battles.<ref name=vgce />

==Development==
''War in the South Pacific'' was designed by [[Gary Grigsby]] and was published by [[Strategic Simulations|Strategic Simulations Inc.]] (SSI).<ref name=vgce>{{cite journal | author=Katz, Arnie | title=Waging World War II: Military Simulations for Computers and Video Games | date=February 1989 | journal=[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]] | pages=76â€“82 }}</ref><ref name=cgwrev>{{cite magazine | author=Proctor, Bob | title=Bali Hai Will Call You: A Review of ''War in the South Pacific'' | date=April 1987 | issue=36 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=16, 17, 19, 20, 54 }}</ref> According to Bob Proctor of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', the title had a troubled development and "was delayed more than a year" because its scope chafed against [[Random-access memory|RAM]] limitations. "[T]he various game modules are all within a handful of bytes of filling the memory", he wrote, and noted ''War in the South Pacific'' shipped with glitches because it was impossible to fix them without more RAM. These problems led SSI reconsider producing monster wargames for 64K machines; Proctor wrote that Grigsby and the rest of the team were "well aware of the game's faults" when it shipped.<ref name=cgwrev /> ''War in the South Pacific'' was released in 1987 for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]].<ref name=cgwrev /><ref name=guru>{{cite magazine | author=Emrich, Alan | title=The Pioneering Spirit of a Wargame Guru | date=September 1995 | issue=134 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=201, 202, 204 }}</ref>
