{{nihongo foot|'''''Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School'''''|中山美穂のトキメキハイスクール|Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki Hai Sukūru|"Miho Nakayama's Heartbeat High School"|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is a [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] [[dating sim]] developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] and [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Nintendo R&D1]], and published by [[Nintendo]] exclusively in Japan for the [[Famicom Disk System]]. The game was released on December 1, 1987. It was one of the first dating sim games.<ref name="DEN"/> It was designed by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], who also created the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, and [[Yoshio Sakamoto]], who co-created ''[[Metroid]]''. The music for the game was composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]<ref name="kotaku"/> and Toshiaki Imai.<ref name="guru"/> Pop idol [[Miho Nakayama]] contributed her name and likeness and [[voice acting|voice-acted]] tie-in segments that could be accessed by calling toll-free phone numbers revealed during the progress of gameplay.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://w.atwiki.jp/famicomall/pages/703.html | title=中山美穂の トキメキハイスクール(Disk) - 「Fcのゲーム制覇しましょ」まとめ }}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The game's protagonist enters Tokimeki High School and runs into a girl wearing glasses who looks identical to Miho Nakayama.<ref name="DEN"/> Though the game is a standard text command-style [[adventure game]] similar to the ''[[Famicom Tantei Club]]'' series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the "game over" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other [[text adventure game]]s where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist.<ref name="DEN"/> This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a [[dating simulation]] rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.

==Development==
[[Image:MihoHighschool.jpg|thumb|The intricate decision making required for success made the game's level of realism notable for its time.]]
''Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School'' was the first [[bishōjo game]] featuring a [[Japanese idol]]. [[Miho Nakayama]], a popular actress and singer in Japan during the 1980s, is featured on the game's cover and makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the game itself.<ref name="kotaku"/> It was created through a collaboration between [[Nintendo]] and [[Square (video game company)|Square Co.]], the later of which had just finished ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name="together"/> The game was developed by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] (creator of ''Final Fantasy''), and Yoshio Sakamoto (producer of ''[[Metroid]]'').<ref name="together"/> Sakamoto, then in his fifth year at Nintendo, was excited at the prospect of making an adventure game, but came up with an idea of using a real life celebrity instead of creating a new character, to make the game feel like an "event" or a "kind of festival".<ref name="nintendo"/> The game was developed in a two-week period.<ref name="interview"/>

It was the third game compatible with the Disk Fax network of the Disk System, and uses a blue floppy disk instead of the regular yellow disk.<ref name="DEN"/> In 1987 Square wanted to make a Disk Fax adventure game, and Nintendo suggested that the game includes an idol, as it would interest players.<ref name="kotaku"/> Though most compatible games used the Disk Fax network to upload [[high score]]s or [[time trial]]s onto the official rankings system, ''Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School'' was the only game where players used the network to register that they had completed the game to receive [[prize]]s. The game also contained a phone number which players could call to hear hints concerning the gameplay or listen to a personal message voiced by Miho Nakayama herself.<ref name="DEN"/> This phone service ended shortly after the release of the game, and the messages and hints are displayed in text form in subsequent versions of the game. The Disk Fax service was used for a contest from December 19, 1987, to February 29, 1988, in which 8000 winners received an autographed phonecard (for those who finished the game with the "normal" ending) and 8000 received a special VHS tape (for those who finished with the "best" ending).<ref name="DEN"/>

== Reception ==
The game topped the bi-weekly Japanese ''[[Famitsu]]'' sales chart in December 1987.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=ファミコン通信 TOP 30: 2月5日 |trans-title=Famicom Tsūshin Top 30: February 5 |magazine=[[Famicom Tsūshin]] |date=19 February 1988 |volume=1988 |issue=4 |pages=12–7 |url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/4152-famitsu-issue-0043-february-19-1988/ |lang=ja}}</ref>

In reader votes of Japanese ''Family Computer Magazine'', the game received a 17.40 out of 25.<ref name="famimaga47">{{Cite journal |title = 5月24日号特別付録 ファミコンディスクカード ゲームボーイ スーパーファミコン オールカタログ|date = 1991-05-24 |publisher = [[Tokuma Shoten|徳間書店]] |journal = ファミリーコンピュータMagazine |volume = 7 |number = 10 |page = 47}}</ref>

[[1UP.com]] called it the 10th "Sorta Significant Famicom Games", citing it status as a forerunner of the [[dating simulation]] game that would later become popular in Japan.<ref name="1up" /> [[GamesRadar]] listed the Japanese television commercial as one of the best and strangest [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] commercials.<ref name="career" />
