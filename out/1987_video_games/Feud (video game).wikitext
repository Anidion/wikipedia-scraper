'''''Feud''''' is an [[adventure game]] designed by [[Ste_and_John_Pickford|John Pickford]]<ref name="Pickford"/> for Binary Design and published in 1987 as the first game under the Bulldog Software label of [[Mastertronic]].<ref name="crash38">{{cite journal |title=Feud |journal=CRASH|issue=38 |url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/38/feud.htm}}</ref> Versions were released for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], [[MSX]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. The player takes on the role of the sorcerer Learic, and must fight his evil brother Leanoric.<ref name="Pickford"/>

==Gameplay==

The only real enemy is Leanoric. To achieve your objective, the player must collect many herbs scattered across the map and mix them in a cauldron to make offensive and defensive spells. The spells vary from fireballs and lightning to invisibility and even turning peaceful villagers into zombies. A compass indicates Leanoric's location.  Several of the herbs are found in a garden, tended by a gardener.  The gardener, though slow-moving, is also able to inflict damage on Learic.

Leanoric, as a [[non-player character]], has to do the same thing, collecting herbs to mix in his cauldron before hunting you down in order to attack.

==Development==
After developing ''[[Zub]]'', John Pickford went on to design a game that he wasn't going to program. This required designing the game on paper before development started and overseeing the work of a different programming team.<ref name="Pickford"/>

Reviewer "Ben" for ''[[Crash (magazine)|CRASH]]'' wrote, "What a way to kick off a new label! Feud is completely brilliant. I love original games, so it is a real pleasure to see a cheapie that’s as ‘new’ in concept as this — and as playable."<ref name=crash38/> Robert Swan, in his favorable review for ''[[Atari User]]'' magazine, stated that the game has "fantastic graphics, great sound, addictive gameplay and plenty of action-packed screens." He also praised the game's low price.<ref name="atariuser"/>
