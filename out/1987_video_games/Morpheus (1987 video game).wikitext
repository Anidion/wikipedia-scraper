'''''Morpheus''''' is a 1987 [[shoot 'em up]] developed by [[Graftgold]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and published by [[Rainbird (software company)|Rainbird]]. The game's designer, [[Andrew Braybrook]], wrote a series of articles on the game's creation for the magazine ''[[Zzap!64]]'' over eight months.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://paulemozplaysagameaday.blogspot.com/2011/09/morpheus-commodore-64.html|title=A Gamer Forever Voyaging: Morpheus (Commodore 64)|date=12 September 2011|website=Paulemozplaysagameaday.blogspot.com|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
''Morpheus'' features 50 subuniverses called Aithers, each of which consists of a central Nucleus surrounded by obstacles called Orbitals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Morpheus |url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzap31/morpheus.html |website=Zapp64 }}</ref> The aim of the game is for players to break through the obstacles to destroy the Nucleus, and by the end of level 50, Morpheus as a whole. Players will also encounter enemies such as Morphii and aliens which can be killed for points. Morpheus allows players to use points earned to purchase weapons, and customize various features of their ships, such as auxiliary weapons and expansion ports to allow various gameplay possibilities.<ref name=":0" />

==Reception==
''[[Zzap!64]]'' magazines positively reviewed the game and awarded it a Sizzler rating with an overall score of 90%. They described it as "without a doubt one of the most finely constructed games ever written for the 64". The graphics were praised, but reviewers noted that the gameplay style significantly departed from Braybrook's previous games. Reviewers recommended that readers try the game before purchasing. Although technically accomplished, it might not appeal to everyone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzap31/morpheus.html|title=Morpheus Review|website=Zzap64.co.uk|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> Many Commodore Users were also enthusiastic about the game, saying it "reeks of quality". Their only criticism was the lack of a game save and load facility. ''[[Zzap!64]]'' gave it a 9 out of 10 rating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-user-magazine-53/page/n81/mode/2up?view=theater|title = Commodore User Magazine Issue 53|date = February 1988}}</ref>

[[Computer and Video Games]]' reviews were less enthusiastic about the game, which they considered a disappointment, noting "the originality of the game is great, but the gameplay is extremely laborious." The reviewer believed the music and sound effects were the best thing about the game, saying it was "visually very good." They advised potential purchasers to try the game first. It was rated 7/10.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-074/page/n31/mode/1up?view=theater|title=CVG Magazine Issue 074|date=December 1987}}</ref>
