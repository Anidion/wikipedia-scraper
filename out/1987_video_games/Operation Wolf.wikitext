{{nihongo foot|'''''Operation Wolf'''''|オペレーションウルフ|Operēshon Urufu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[light gun shooter]]<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Operation Wolf|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=153|pages=36|author=Martyn Carroll|quote="The operation of the gun has been a source of confusion over the years. Is it a lightgun or is it a gun that works like a joystick? The presence of an optic sensor inside the gun proves that it is a lightgun."}}</ref> [[arcade game]] developed by [[Taito]] and released in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8927 | title = Operation Wolf | publisher =The International Arcade Museum | access-date =October 3, 2013}}</ref> It was ported to many home systems.

The game was critically and commercially successful, becoming one of the highest-grossing [[1988 in video games|arcade games of 1988]] and winning the [[Golden Joystick Award for Game of the Year]]. ''Operation Wolf'' popularized military-themed first-person light gun [[rail shooter]]s and inspired numerous clones, imitators, and others in the genre over the next decade. It spawned four sequels: ''[[Operation Thunderbolt (video game)|Operation Thunderbolt]]'' (1988), ''[[Operation Wolf 3]]'' (1994), ''Operation Tiger'' (1998), and ''Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission'' (2023).

==Gameplay==
Assuming the role of Special Forces Operative Roy Adams, the player attempts to rescue five hostages who are being held captive in enemy territory. The game is viewed from a first-person perspective, and is on rails, with the screen  scrolling horizontally through the landscape.<ref name="Crash"/> The game has six stages to advance the story. For example, after the jungle stage is completed, Adams interrogates an enemy soldier and learns the location of the concentration camp and hostages. Each stage has unique objectives and effects on gameplay after completion, all based on rescuing hostages. [[Game over]] screens vary depending on situations, such as the player's death or failure to rescue all hostages. Continuing the game restarts the stage. The Nintendo Entertainment System version has multiple endings depending on the number of rescued hostages.

The arcade cabinet has an [[Light gun|optical controller]] resembling an [[Uzi]] submachine gun which the player can swivel and elevate, and which vibrates to [[haptic technology|simulate recoil]] of gunfire.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/O/Operation%20Wolf%20Operating%20Manual.pdf | title = Operation Wolf (arcade maintenance manual) | last = Taito | publisher = Taito | access-date = April 29, 2015}}</ref> Pulling the trigger allows fully automatic fire, and pressing the button near the muzzle launches a grenade with a wide blast radius against multiple targets.

To complete each stage, the player must shoot a required number of soldiers and vehicles (trucks, boats, helicopters, armored transports), as indicated by an on-screen counter. The limited ammunition and grenades can be replenished by shooting objects. Shooting dynamite bombs causes heavy damage to every target on the screen, both enemy and friendly, and a special machine gun power-up allows unlimited ammunition and an increased rate of fire for 10 seconds.

Enemies attack with gunfire, knives, grenades, mortar and bazooka rounds, and missiles; all their visible incoming projectiles can be shot out of the air. The player has a damage bar that slowly fills due to enemy attacks or shooting friendly targets such as nurses and boys. Damage can be recovered by collecting health power-ups and completing stages.

==Home conversions==
[[File:Operation_Wolf_DOS_Screenshot.png|thumb|[[MS-DOS]] version]]
The game was converted to the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[DOS]], [[NES]], [[Amiga 500]], [[Atari ST]], [[Master System]], [[FM Towns]], [[Commodore 64]], [[PC Engine]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. Most lack [[light gun]] support (except NES and Master System) and must be played with a keyboard or a controller. In 1989, a special ZX Spectrum version with [[Magnum Light Phaser]] support was produced for inclusion in [[Amstrad|Amstrad's]] ZX Spectrum +2 and +3 Action Pack hardware bundles.<ref name='crash60'>{{cite magazine |title=Gunning Your Speccy|magazine=Crash |issue=65 |publisher=Newsfield|date=June 1989|page=31|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=1032&page=31|access-date=2 August 2021}}</ref> The box for the Master System version features promotional art from ''[[Operation Thunderbolt (video game)|Operation Thunderbolt]]''.

In 2005, ''Operation Wolf'' was released on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] within ''[[Taito Legends]]'' without light gun. The NES version was released on the North American Wii Virtual Console in February 2008 without light gun support.

===Critical response===
Upon release in arcades, the game received wide acclaim from critics, particularly for its gameplay, graphics, and controls. Its violence was criticized, particularly in the UK press following the [[Hungerford massacre]] that had occurred a few months before its release.<ref name="retrogamer153">{{cite magazine|title=Operation Wolf|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=153|pages=34–41|first=Martyn|last=Carroll|date=April 2016|url=https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____153}}</ref> ''[[Commodore User]]'' said it beats Sega's ''After Burner'' as "the game of the year and much of next year too" but that it may draw some controversy from tabloids for its ''[[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]]''-like violent content.<ref name="CU"/> Clare Edgeley of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called it one of the best new releases, stating that, though excessively violent, it was an "extremely playable" and "powerful" fast-paced action game.<ref name="CVG_ARC">{{cite magazine |last1=Edgeley |first1=Clare |title=Arcade Action: Operation Wolf |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=November 15, 1987 |issue=74 (December 1987) |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/30/248}}</ref> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' called it a "fast and furious" action game,<ref name="YS26">{{cite magazine |last=Brennan |first=Ciarán |title=Slots of Fun |magazine=[[Your Sinclair]] |date=January 1988 |issue=26 (February 1988) |pages=22–3 |url=https://archive.org/details/your-sinclair-26/page/n77/mode/2up}}</ref> and said it "broke a bit of new 'ground' for arcade games 'cos the 'nasties' fired directly at you through the screen".<ref name="YS36"/>

==Legacy==
''Operation Wolf'' had long-term influence on the market upon its release. It is credited with evolving the light gun shooter genre. It departed from the shooting gallery, carnival, and cartoon themes that had previously dominated the genre for decades, from [[electro-mechanical game]]s in the 1960s until [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Duck Hunt]]'' in 1984, and moved the genre toward more realistic, violent, and military shooter themes.<ref name="retrogamer153"/><ref name="denofgeek">{{cite news |last1=Lambie |first1=Ryan |title=Operation Wolf: The Ultimate '80s Military Gun Game |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/games/operation-wolf-the-ultimate-80s-military-gun-game/ |access-date=April 23, 2021 |work=[[Den of Geek]] |date=March 1, 2015}}</ref> In contrast to Taito's earlier gun games including ''Attack'' (1976), ''N.Y. Captor'' (1985), and ''Cycle Shooting'' (1986) which have simple cartoon graphics, ''Operation Wolf'' has more realistic graphics. This provides a depth of perspective by using different sized [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]].<ref name="retrogamer153"/>

''Operation Wolf'' took the military themes of 1980s [[run and gun video game]]s (such as ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'', ''[[Rush'n Attack|Green Beret]]'', and ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'')<ref name="denofgeek"/> and [[action films]] (such as ''Rambo'' and ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'') and applied them to light gun shooters.<ref name="retrogamer153"/> It presents a novel light gun shooter basis for the prisoner of war (POW) rescue mission with massive violence, killing masses of enemy soldiers.<ref name="retrogamer153"/> It innovates on the mounted gun mechanism - used before in Taito's ''Attack'' and even older [[Midway Games|Midway]] mechanical games from the 1960s - by using an optical sensor and a physical sensation of gunfire.<ref name="retrogamer153"/> It spawned many arcade shooters with mounted machine gun controls and increasing levels of violence during the late 1980s to early 1990s.<ref name="One31">{{cite magazine|title = The Price is Right|date = March 28, 1991|url = https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-31/page/n79/mode/2up|magazine = [[The One (magazine)|The One]]|publisher = [[EMAP Images]]|last = Presley|first = Paul|issue = 31 (April 1991)|pages = 80–1}}</ref><ref name="SU117">{{cite magazine |last=Cook |first=John |title=Coin Ops |url=https://archive.org/details/sinclair-user-magazine-117/page/n61 |magazine=[[Sinclair User]] |issue=117 (November 1991) |pages=62–63 |date=October 15, 1991 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=United Kingdom}}</ref>

The game popularized first-person light gun rail shooters and inspired numerous clones and imitators during the late 1980s to early 1990s.<ref name="Sega"/><ref name="denofgeek"/><ref name="One31"/> Examples include [[SNK]]'s ''[[Mechanized Attack]]'' and [[Sega]]'s ''[[Line of Fire (video game)|Line of Fire]]'' in 1989,<ref name="Sega"/> SNK's ''[[Beast Busters]]'' in 1990, [[Namco]]'s ''[[Steel Gunner]]'' and Midway's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day (arcade game)|Terminator 2]]'' in 1991,<ref name="retrogamer153"/> and [[Konami]]'s ''[[Lethal Enforcers]]'' in 1992.<ref name="denofgeek"/> Further influenced by ''Operation Wolf'', the genre remained popular into the late 1990s and declined following the rise of the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) genre.<ref name="denofgeek"/>

''Operation Wolf'' spawned four sequels: ''[[Operation Thunderbolt (video game)|Operation Thunderbolt]]'' ([[1988 in video gaming|1988]]), ''[[Operation Wolf 3]]'' ([[1994 in video gaming|1994]]), ''Operation Tiger'' ([[1998 in video gaming|1998]]), and ''Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission'' ([[2023 in video gaming|2023]]).
