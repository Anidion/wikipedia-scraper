'''''Katakis''''' is a [[scrolling shooter|horizontally scrolling shooter]] developed for the [[Commodore 64]] by [[Rainbow Arts]] in 1987, and converted to the [[Amiga]] by [[Factor 5]] in 1988. It was re-released as '''''Denaris''''' in 1989. The name Katakis has a [[Greece|Greek]] origin and was found in a phone book in [[GÃ¼tersloh]], [[Germany]]. The name Denaris was created by a random name generator, and by coincidence, matches a Greek name as well.<ref>[http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/Katakis Katakis on C64-Wiki]</ref>

==Plot==
The game takes place on the planet Katakis, a human colony in deep space. There, scientists developed machinery with advanced [[artificial intelligence]] capabilities. However, the machines eventually evolved beyond the control of their human creators and overtook the planet. The humans attempted to retaliate through the use of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear ballistic missiles]], but the machines survived.

The colonists' remaining plan is to use a series of DS-H75 Eagle Fighter space gliders to attack the machines and retake the planet.

==Gameplay==

Katakis has a very similar theme as the game ''[[R-Type]]'', with multiple levels, power-ups and various end-bosses. Players must eliminate enemy opponents to reach various [[Boss (video games)|end-bosses]]. One major innovation is the fact that the two-player mode features the second player controlling the Force module. This creates an unusual play strategy of the attacker and the defender, since the main ship is vulnerable to enemy fire and hazards.

==Controversy==
Due to the game's obvious similarity to ''R-Type'', rights holder [[Activision|Activision Europe]] delivered an ultimatum: either Factor 5 accept a contract to perform the official R-Type conversion for the [[Amiga]] home computer, or receive a lawsuit for rights infringement. According to Julian Eggebrecht, this was because "Activision couldn't find any programmers" but the opportunity was "a dream come true".<ref name="F5 Interview Pt1">{{cite interview | title=Factor 5 Interview (Part I) | date=February 23, 1998 |first=Julian | last=Eggebrecht | subject-link=Julian Eggebrecht | interviewer=Peer Schneider | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1998/02/24/factor-5-interview-part-i | accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Factor 5 released the Amiga version of ''Katakis'' as freeware as follows:

In ''[[Turrican II]]'' (also designed by [[Manfred Trenz]]) there are references to the [[Commodore 64]] version of Katakis. At the end of level 2-2, the main character takes off in a fighter resembling the one from Katakis. During the take-off sequence, the fighter's drone pod can also briefly be seen, hanging from the ceiling. From that point, and for the whole world 3 duration, the game turns from a platform shooter to a scrolling shooter. There is also an easter egg: before level 3-2's end boss, a Katakis bonus container ship appears. If shot down, it reveals a "question mark" (?) bonus (unique in the whole Turrican II game map) that, if picked up, makes a helicopter walker robot appear, towing a banner with "KATAKIS LIVES!!!" written on it. The [[Super NES]] video game ''[[Super Turrican (1993 video game)|Super Turrican]]'' is also set on a planet called Katakis.
