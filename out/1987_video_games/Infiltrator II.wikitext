==Reception==
M. Evan Brooks reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "While it is a credible job overall, this reviewer's hesitancy in offering a recommendation is that the product is more difficult than the normal arcade product. Given that difficulty, when compared against the likes of Gunship, it obviously falls short in both realism and replay value. If one is more inclined towards the arcade spectrum, however, Infiltrator II should fill the bill."<ref name="CGW44">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M.
