'''''MicroLeague Wrestling''''' is a [[professional wrestling]] simulation [[video game]], the first based on the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), released in 1987 for [[Commodore 64]] and [[Atari ST]] and in 1989 for [[Amiga]] and [[DOS]]. It was developed by MicroLeague and published by MicroLeague. The game is part of the company's ''MicroLeague'' sports series, which included ''[[MicroLeague Baseball]]''.

In contrast to most action-oriented wrestling games, the gameplay in ''MicroLeague Wrestling'' involves [[turn-based strategy]]. Players select one of several pre-set matches and choose their wrestler's actions via a menu. Wrestlers are depicted using digitized photographs from actual matches.

The game uses turn-based strategy, as players choose a move from their wrestler's arsenal as their opponent does the same, and depending on the situation, one move will successfully be done. Each wrestler has five "basic" moves (which cause two damage points), four "major" moves (which cause four damage points), and one "super" move (which causes six damage points and is the only way to attempt to pin the opponent). Each wrestler also has a block option, which if done successfully will remove two of their own damage points. In addition, [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] wrestlers can attempt a special move in which they rally the crowd to gain momentum and recover some of their damage. [[Heel (professional wrestling)|Heel]] wrestlers can attempt special cheating tactics, but this runs the risk of disqualification.

The moves and scenes in the game's matches are accompanied by digitized images of them occurring from each specific match. The original ''MicroLeague Wrestling'' disk, released in 1987, features [[Hulk Hogan]] vs. [[Randy Savage]] on one side and Hulk Hogan vs. [[Paul Orndorff]] on the other. In 1988, two expansion discs were released, known as the "WWF Superstar Series". The first of these features Randy Savage vs. [[The Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Jim Duggan]] vs. [[Harley Race]]. The second disk features Hulk Hogan vs. [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Jake Roberts]] vs. [[Rick Rude]].<ref name=1UP>{{cite web|last=Ragan|first=Jess|title=Retronauts: MicroLeague Wrestling|date=September 7, 2011|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9087941|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=29 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714000443/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9087941|archivedate=14 July 2012}}</ref> The Amiga and DOS versions, released in 1989, feature Hogan vs. Savage (from a later match between them) and Hogan vs. DiBiase. There were no expansions released for this version as the WWF ceased production of the game to focus on console games.

Before the matches, [[Gene Okerlund|Mean Gene Okerlund]] interviews the participants. [[Howard Finkel]] does ring introductions. During the matches, text commentary is provided by [[Vince McMahon]] and either [[Jesse Ventura]] or [[Bruno Sammartino]]. The expansion disks as well as the later versions of the game feature the teams of McMahon and Ventura and [[Gorilla Monsoon]] with either [[Bobby Heenan]] or [[Alfred Hayes (wrestler)|Lord Alfred Hayes]].
