'''''E.O.S.: Earth Orbit Stations''''' is a [[space station]] construction and management simulation game developed by Karl Buiter for [[Electronic Arts]].<ref name="giantlist"/> It was released for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Apple II series|Apple II]] in 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Earth Orbit Stations|url=https://www.myabandonware.com/game/earth-orbit-stations-an|access-date=2021-12-06|website=My Abandonware|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}

The game focuses on both the material and economic challenges of building a permanent, fully functioning space station in [[geocentric orbit]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Earth Orbit Stations (1987) |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/17545/earth-orbit-stations/ |access-date=2023-08-29 |website=MobyGames |language=en}}</ref>

The game was set in 1996, and the player is given various selected scenarios to fulfill, from mundane tasks such as setting up a simple space station to developing and supplying a specified amount of high-grade, [[zero G]] [[pharmaceutical]]s to being the first to contact alien life. The game also is a cutthroat strategy game in multiplayer, as players compete over finite resources and resource management.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1987 gave the game a mixed review. While the single-player portion was praised, the review felt the game had too high a learning curve to be really suitable for multiplayer. The user interface was particularly bothersome, described as "a textbook case of how ''not'' to design a window/menu/graphics interface." The documentation was similarly described as poorly organized and cryptic.<ref name = "CGW">{{citation | date = October 1987 | last = Williams | first = Gregg | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Earth Orbit Stations  | pages = 26–27}}</ref> In 1992 and 1994 surveys of science fiction games the magazine gave the title two-plus stars of five, calling it "An interesting failure ... the logistics just are not that much fun".<ref name="brooks199211">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100 | title=Strategy & Wargames: The Future (2000-....) | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date= November 1992 | accessdate=4 July 2014 | author=Brooks, M.
