Reviewing ''Battle Cruiser'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', Bob Proctor called it "the exact same game [as ''Warship''] with new Ship and Weapon Tables."<ref name=cgwrev>{{cite magazine | author=Proctor, Bob | title=''Battle Cruiser'' | issue=38 | date=June–July 1987 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=30, 31 }}</ref> M. Evan Brooks of ''Current Notes'' offered a similar opinion, but felt that ''Battle Cruiser'' was "a better bargain".<ref name=currentnotes /> In ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'', Rich Moore opined that the game's "graphics aren't great, but this quickly becomes secondary".<ref name=antic>{{cite journal | author1=Moore, Rich | author2=Stanoch, John | title=Call to Wargames | journal=[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]] | date=March 1988 | volume=6 | number=11 | pages=10, 14 }}</ref>

In a 1988 ''[[Page 6]]'' survey of wargames for Atari computers, Brooks wrote of ''Battle Cruiser'', "No new ground is broken, although this is the better bargain given its more extensive coverage."<ref name=page6>{{cite journal | author=Brooks, M. Evan | title=Wargames | journal=[[Page 6]] | issue=31 | date=January–February 1988 | pages=12–16 }}</ref> In his similar 1989 survey, J. L. Miller wrote in ''Computer Play'' that ''Battle Cruiser'' was "historically accurate and recommended for the naval buff."<ref name=currentnotes />
