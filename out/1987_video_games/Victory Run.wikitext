{{nihongo|'''''Victory Run'''''|ビクトリーラン栄光の13,000キロ―|Bikutoriran Eikou no 13,000 Kiroo|"Victory Run: 13,000 Kilometers of Glory"}} is a 1987 [[racing game]] released for the [[PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16]], and also available on the [[Nintendo]] [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] and on [[PlayStation Network]]. The game depicts the [[Dakar Rally|Paris-Dakar Rally]], one of the earliest to do so. One of the unique features at the time of release of Victory Run was that the car's parts degraded as they are used and/or abused.

The player can acquire up to 20 spare parts before the first race, but cannot acquire any more spare parts after starting the first race.
