'''''Maniac Mansion''''' is a 1987 [[graphic adventure game|graphic adventure]] video game developed and published by [[LucasArts|Lucasfilm Games]]. It follows teenage protagonist Dave Miller as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend Sandy Pantz from a [[mad scientist]], whose mind has been enslaved by a sentient meteor. The player uses a [[point-and-click]] interface to guide Dave and two of his six playable friends through the scientist's mansion while solving puzzles and avoiding dangers. Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]], and the game must be completed in different ways based on the player's choice of characters. Initially released for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Apple II]], ''Maniac Mansion'' was Lucasfilm Games' first [[Self-publishing|self-published]] product.

The game was conceived in 1985 by [[Ron Gilbert]] and [[Gary Winnick (game developer)|Gary Winnick]], who sought to tell a comedic story based on horror film and [[B-movie]] clichés. They mapped out the project as a [[paper-and-pencil game]] before coding commenced. While earlier adventure titles had relied on [[Command-line interface|command lines]], Gilbert disliked such systems, and he developed ''Maniac Mansion''{{'}}s simpler point-and-click interface as a replacement. To speed up production, he created a [[game engine]] called [[SCUMM]], which was used in [[LucasArts adventure games|many later LucasArts titles]]. After its release, ''Maniac Mansion'' was [[porting of video games|ported]] to several platforms. A port for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] had to be reworked heavily, in response to [[Nintendo of America]]’s concerns that the game was inappropriate for children.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/maniac.html |title=The Expurgation of Maniac Mansion |website=www.crockford.com |access-date=2016-05-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012031110/http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/maniac.html |archive-date=2007-10-12}}</ref>

''Maniac Mansion'' was critically acclaimed: reviewers lauded its graphics, [[cutscene]]s, animation, and humor. Writer [[Orson Scott Card]] praised it as a step toward "computer games [becoming] a valid storytelling art". It influenced numerous graphic adventure titles, and its point-and-click interface became a standard feature in the genre. The game's success solidified Lucasfilm as a serious rival to adventure game studios such as [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]]. In 1990, ''Maniac Mansion'' was adapted into a three-season [[Maniac Mansion (TV series)|television series of the same name]], written by [[Eugene Levy]] and starring [[Joe Flaherty]]. A sequel to the game, ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'', was released in 1993.

''Maniac Mansion'' is a [[graphic adventure game]] in which the player uses a [[point-and-click]] interface to guide characters through a [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] game world and to solve puzzles. Fifteen action commands, such as "Walk To" and "Unlock", may be selected by the player from a menu on the screen's lower half.<ref name=zzap /><ref name=ace /> The player starts the game by choosing two out of six characters to accompany protagonist Dave Miller: Bernard, Jeff, Michael, Razor, Syd, and Wendy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manic Mansion characters|url=http://www.maniacmansionfan.50webs.com/characters.html|website=Maniac Mansion Fans}}</ref><ref name=zzap /> Each character possesses unique abilities: for example, Syd and Razor can play musical instruments, while Bernard can repair appliances.<ref name="NP-14">{{cite magazine |title=Previews: ''Maniac Mansion'' |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |location=[[Redmond, WA]] |date=July–August 1990 |issue=14 |pages=62–63 |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582}}</ref> The game may be completed with any combination of characters; but, since many puzzles are solvable only by certain characters, different paths must be taken based on the group's composition.<ref name=mmmanual>{{cite book | last=Laurel | first=Brenda | title=Maniac Mansion ''manual'' | publisher=[[LucasArts|Lucasfilm Games]] | pages = 1–5 | year=1987 | location=[[San Rafael, CA]]}}</ref><ref name=nintpower>{{cite magazine |date=September–October 1990 |title=''Maniac Mansion'' |magazine=Nintendo Power |publisher=Nintendo |location=Redmond, WA |issue=16 |pages=14–19 |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582}}</ref> ''Maniac Mansion'' features [[cutscene]]s, a word coined by [[Ron Gilbert]],<ref name="GrumpyIn9">{{cite web |last=Gilbert |first=Ron |author-link=Ron Gilbert |title=''Maniac Mansion'' in 9 |publisher= Grumpy Gamer |date=April 12, 2007 |access-date=March 3, 2011 |url=http://grumpygamer.com/8139425|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415021118/http://grumpygamer.com/8139425|archive-date=April 15, 2007}}</ref><ref name="GS-Fame">{{cite news|last1=Buecheler|first1=Christopher|title=The GameSpy Hall of Fame|work=GameSpy|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/mm.shtm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311072453/http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/mm.shtm|archive-date=11 March 2011}}</ref> that interrupt gameplay to advance the story and inform the player about offscreen events.<ref name=zzap /><ref name=mmmanual />

''Maniac Mansion'' was conceived in 1985 when [[Lucasfilm Games]] employees [[Ron Gilbert]] and [[Gary Winnick (game developer)|Gary Winnick]] were assigned to create an original game.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro">{{cite journal |journal=[[GamesTM]] |publisher=Imagine Publishing |location=Bournemouth |title=Behind the Scenes: ''Maniac Mansion'' + ''Day of the Tentacle'' |year=2010 |issue=3 |pages=22–27 |series=The Ultimate Retro Companion |issn=1448-2606 |oclc=173412381}}</ref> Gilbert had been hired the previous year as a programmer for the game ''[[Koronis Rift]]''.<ref name="GDC-Post" /> He befriended Winnick over their similar tastes in humor, film, and television. Company management provided little oversight in the creation of ''Maniac Mansion'', a trend to which Gilbert credited the success of several of his games for Lucasfilm.<ref name="RG2011">{{cite journal |last=Hunt |first=Stuart |title=The Making Of ''Maniac Mansion'' |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=[[Bournemouth]] |issue=94 |date=September 2011 |pages=24–33 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015}}</ref>

Gilbert and Winnick co-wrote and co-designed the project, and also worked separately with Gilbert on programming and Winnick on visuals. As both of them enjoyed [[B movie|B horror films]], they decided to make a comedy-horror game set in a haunted house.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro" /><ref name="GDC-Post" /> They drew inspiration from a film whose name Winnick could not recall. He described it as "a ridiculous teen horror movie", in which teenagers inside a building were killed one by one without any thought of leaving. This film, combined with clichés from popular horror movies such as ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', became the basis for the game's setting. Early work on the game progressed organically: according to Gilbert, "very little was written down. Gary and I just talked and laughed a lot, and out it came".<ref name="RG2011" /> Lucasfilm Games relocated to the Stable House at [[Skywalker Ranch]] during ''Maniac Mansion''{{'}}s conception period, and the ranch's Main House was used as a model for the mansion. Several rooms from the Main House received exact reproductions in the game, such as a library with a spiral staircase and a media room with a large-screen TV and [[grand piano]].<ref name="GDC-Post">{{cite web|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014732/Classic-Game-Postmortem-MANIAC |last=Gilbert |first=Ron |title=Classic Game Postmortem: ''Maniac Mansion'' |publisher=[[Game Developers Conference]] |format=Flash Video |date=March 4, 2011 |access-date=March 23, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324201117/http://gdcvault.com/play/1014732/Classic-Game-Postmortem-MANIAC |archive-date=March 24, 2011}}</ref>

The man-eating plant is similar to that of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''.<ref name="GDC-Post"/> The developers sought to strike a balance between tension and humor with the game's story.<ref name="ClassicIntro" />

[[File:Skywalker Ranch Main House.jpg|thumb|alt=A large white house with black roofing in front of green hills and forests.|The Main House at [[Skywalker Ranch]] inspired the design of ''Maniac Mansion''{{'}}s setting.]]
Initially, Gilbert and Winnick struggled to choose a [[Video game genre|gameplay genre]] for ''Maniac Mansion''. While visiting relatives over Christmas, Gilbert saw his cousin play ''[[King's Quest I|King's Quest: Quest for the Crown]]'', an adventure game by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]]. Although he was a fan of text adventures, this was Gilbert's first experience with a graphic adventure, and he used the holiday to play the game and familiarize himself with the format. As a result, he decided to develop his and Winnick's ideas into a graphic adventure game.<ref name="GDC-Post"/><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6IYgWh-qnY&t=49m16s |title=Storytime with Ron Gilbert - PAX Australia 2013 Keynote |last=Gilbert |first=Ron Gilbert |date=July 19, 2013 |conference=[[PAX Australia]] |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207121323/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6IYgWh-qnY&t=49m16s |archive-date=2015-12-07 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="usgamer interview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/use-questions-on-developer-a-ron-gilbert-retrospective/ |title=Page 2: Use Questions on Developer: A Ron Gilbert Retrospective |first=Bob |last=Mackey |work=[[USGamer]] |date=November 9, 2015 |access-date=November 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151110055029/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/use-questions-on-developer-a-ron-gilbert-retrospective |archive-date=November 10, 2015}}</ref>

''Maniac Mansion''{{'}}s story and structure were designed before coding commenced. The project's earliest incarnation was a [[Paper-and-pencil game|paper-and-pencil board game]], in which the mansion's floor plan was used as a game board, and cards represented events and characters.<ref name=Edge2 /> Lines connected the rooms to illustrate pathways by which characters could travel. Strips of [[cellulose acetate]] were used to map out the game's puzzles by tracking which items worked together when used by certain characters. Impressed by the map's complexity, Winnick included it in the final game as a poster hung on a wall.<ref name="GDC-Post"/> Because each character contributes different skills and resources, the pair spent months working on the event combinations that could occur. This extended the game's production time beyond that of previous Lucasfilm Games projects, which almost led to Gilbert's firing.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/><ref name="youtube.com">{{cite conference |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDvEFbh6I2g&t=34m21s |title=Classic Studio Postmortem: Lucasfilm Games |last=Gilbert |first=Ron |date=March 24, 2014 |conference=[[Game Developers Conference]] |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904033643/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDvEFbh6I2g&t=34m21s |archive-date=2015-09-04 |url-status=live}}</ref> The game's dialogue, written by [[David Fox (game designer)|David Fox]], was not created until after programming had begun.<ref name="Edge2"/>

===Production and SCUMM===
{{main|SCUMM}}
Gilbert started programming ''Maniac Mansion'' in 6502 [[assembly language]], but he quickly decided that the project was too large and complex for this method.<ref name="GDC-Post"/><ref name="Edge">{{cite magazine | author=Edge Staff | magazine = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] | location=[[Bath, Somerset]] | title=The Making Of: ''Maniac Mansion'' | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/the-making-of-maniac-mansion | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100806183054/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/the-making-of-maniac-mansion | page=1 | date=August 6, 2010 | archive-date=August 6, 2010}}</ref> He decided that a new [[game engine]] would have to be created.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/><ref name="Edge"/> Its coding language was initially planned to be [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]-inspired, but Gilbert opted for one similar to [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Yacc]].<ref name="GDC-Post"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Bevan |first=Mike |author2=Staff |title=The SCUMM Diary: Stories behind one of the greatest game engines ever made |work=[[Gamasutra]] |publisher=[[Informa]] |date=July 12, 2013 |access-date=June 16, 2020 |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/196009/the_scumm_diary_stories_behind_.php}}</ref> Lucasfilm employee [[Chip Morningstar]] contributed the base code for the engine, which Gilbert then built on.<ref name=igninterview>{{cite web|last=Hatfield |first=Daemon |date=April 26, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/26/interview-scumm-of-the-earth |title=Interview: SCUMM of the Earth |page=1 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |access-date=August 21, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009194206/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/26/interview-scumm-of-the-earth |archive-date=October 9, 2015}}</ref> Gilbert hoped to create a "system that could be used on many adventure games, cutting down the time it took to make them".<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/> ''Maniac Mansion''{{'}}s first six-to-nine months of production were dedicated largely to engine development.<ref name="RG2011" /> The game was developed around the [[Commodore 64]] [[home computer]], an 8-bit system with only 64 [[Kilobyte|KB]] of memory.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/> The team wanted to include [[scrolling]] screens,<ref name="GrumpyIn9"/><ref name="GDC-Post"/> but as it was normally impossible to scroll bitmap graphics on the Commodore 64, they had to use lower-detail tile graphics. Winnick gave each character a large head made of three stacked sprites to make them recognizable.<ref name="GDC-Post"/>

Although Gilbert wrote much of the foundational code for ''Maniac Mansion'', the majority of the game's events were programmed by Lucasfilm employee [[David Fox (game designer)|David Fox]].<ref name="GDC-Post" /> Fox was between projects and planned to work on the game only for a month, but he remained with the team for six months.<ref name="Edge"/> With Gilbert, he wrote the characters' dialog and choreographed the action. Winnick's concept art inspired him to add new elements to the game: for example, Fox allowed the player to place a hamster inside the kitchen's microwave.<ref name="Edge2"/>

The team wanted to avoid punishing the player for applying everyday logic in ''Maniac Mansion''. Fox noted that one Sierra game features a scene in which the player, without prior warning, may encounter a [[game over]] screen simply by picking up a shard of glass. He characterized such game design as "sadistic", and he commented: "I know that in the real world I can successfully pick up a broken piece of mirror without dying".<ref name="Edge3">{{cite magazine | author=Edge Staff | magazine = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] | location=[[Bath, Somerset]] | title=The Making Of: ''Maniac Mansion'' | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/the-making-of-maniac-mansion?page=0%2C2 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100820012059/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/the-making-of-maniac-mansion?page=0%2C2 | page=3 | date=August 6, 2010 | archive-date = August 20, 2010}}</ref> Because of the project's [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear puzzle design]], the team struggled to prevent [[No-win situation#In video games|no-win scenarios]], in which the player unexpectedly became unable to complete the game. As a result of this problem, Gilbert later explained: "We were constantly fighting against the desire just to rip out all the endings and just go with three characters, or even sometimes just one character". Lucasfilm Games had only one [[playtest]]er, and many dead-ends went undetected as a result.<ref name="GDC-Post"/> Further playtesting was provided by Gilbert's uncle, to whom Gilbert mailed a [[floppy disk]] of the game's latest version each week.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Gilbert |first=Ron |author-link=Ron Gilbert |interviewer=[[Tim Schafer]] |title=''Double Fine Adventure''! // Ron Gilbert's Words of Wisdom to Tim Schafer |publisher=2 Player Productions |date=January 13, 2012 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re_LWmRJK-g |access-date=June 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911020622/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re_LWmRJK-g |archive-date=2012-09-11 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a copy protection system requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a code book included with the game. This was not present in the Commodore 64 and Apple versions due to lack of disk space, so those instead used an on-disk copy protection.<ref name="GDC-Post"/>

There were two separate versions of the game developed for the NES. The first port was handled and published by [[Jaleco]] only in Japan. Released on June 23, 1988, it featured characters redrawn in a cute art style and generally shrunken rooms. No scrolling is present, leading to rooms larger than a single screen to be displayed via flip-screens. Many of the background details are missing, and instead of a save feature a password, over 100 characters long, is required to save progress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/maniacmansion/maniacmansion.htm |title=Maniac Mansion – Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=2016-03-26 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317053804/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/maniacmansion/maniacmansion.htm |archive-date=2016-03-17}}</ref>

Generally, this port is regarded as being far closer to the original game than the Japanese effort.

Company management was occupied with other projects, and so the port received little attention until employee [[Douglas Crockford]] volunteered to direct it. The team used a modified version of the SCUMM engine called "NES SCUMM" for the port.<ref name="Expurgate"/> According to Crockford, "[one] of the main differences between the NES and PCs is that the NES can do certain things much faster".<ref name=crockfordnp>{{cite magazine |title=NES Journal |magazine=Nintendo Power |publisher=Nintendo |location=Redmond, WA |issue=14 |date=July–August 1990 |page=88 |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582}}</ref> The graphics had to be entirely redrawn to match the NES's [[display resolution]].<ref name="Expurgate"/> [[Tim Schafer]], who later designed ''Maniac Mansion''{{'}}s sequel ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'', received his first professional credit as a playtester for the NES version of ''Maniac Mansion''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=In the Chair with Tim Schafer |journal=Retro Gamer |publisher=Imagine Publishing |location=Bournemouth |issue=22 |date=March 2, 2006 |page=40 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015}}</ref>

During ''Maniac Mansion''{{'}}s development for the Commodore 64, Lucasfilm had censored profanity in the script: for instance, the early line of dialogue "Don't be a shit head" became "Don't be a tuna head".<ref name="GDC-Post" /> Additional content was removed from the NES version to make it suitable for a younger audience, and to conform with Nintendo's policies.<ref name="RG2011" /> Jaleco USA president Howie Rubin warned Crockford about content to which Nintendo might object, such as the word "kill". After reading the NES Game Standards Policy for himself, Crockford suspected that further elements of ''Maniac Mansion'' could be problematic, and he sent a list of questionable content to Jaleco. When the company replied that the content was reasonable, Lucasfilm Games submitted ''Maniac Mansion'' for approval.<ref name="Expurgate"/>

One month later, Nintendo of America was concerned that its content was objectionable, believing it was inappropriate for children, and contacted Lucasfilm Games to request they tone down the inappropriate content, particularly profanity and nudity. Crockford censored this content but attempted to leave the game's essence intact. For example, Nintendo wanted graffiti in one room, which provided an important hint to players, removed from the game. Unable to comply without simultaneously removing the hint, the team simply shortened it. Sexually suggestive and otherwise "graphic" dialogue was edited, including a remark from Dr. Fred about "pretty brains [being] sucked out". The nudity described by Nintendo encompassed a swimsuit calendar, a [[classical sculpture]] and a poster of a mummy in a [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] pose. After a brief fight to keep the sculpture, the team ultimately removed all three. The phrase "NES SCUMM System" in the credits sequence was censored.<ref name="Expurgate"/>

Late in development, Jaleco commissioned [[Realtime Associates]] to provide background music, which no previous version of ''Maniac Mansion'' had featured. Realtime Associates' founder and president David Warhol noted that "video games at that time had to have 'wall to wall' music". He brought in [[George Sanger (musician)|George "The Fat Man" Sanger]] and his band, along with [[David Hayes (musician)|David Hayes]], to compose the score. Their goal was to create songs that suited each character, such as a [[punk rock]] theme for Razor, an [[electronic rock]] theme for Bernard and a version of [[Thin Lizzy]]'s "[[The Boys Are Back in Town]]" for Dave Miller. Warhol translated their work into NES [[chiptune]] music.<ref name="Warhol">{{cite interview|last=Warhol |first=David |title=LucasArts' Secret History: ''Maniac Mansion'': Memories from the developers, and music downloads |publisher=The International House of Mojo |date=January 29, 2008 |access-date=December 24, 2012 |url=http://mixnmojo.com/features/sitefeatures/LucasArts-Secret-History-Maniac-Mansion/4 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104113042/http://mixnmojo.com/features/sitefeatures/LucasArts-Secret-History-Maniac-Mansion/4 |archive-date=January 4, 2013}}</ref>

According to Stuart Hunt of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', ''Maniac Mansion'' received highly positive reviews from critics. Nevertheless, Ron Gilbert noted that "it wasn't a huge hit" commercially. In 2011, Hunt wrote that "as so often tends to be the way with cult classics, the popularity it saw was slow in coming".<ref name="RG2011" />

Keith Farrell of ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' was struck by ''Maniac Mansion''{{'}}s similarity to film, particularly in its use of cutscenes to impart "information or urgency".

Reviewing the NES release, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named it the #20 greatest game released that season: "The graphics are merely okay and the music is Nintendo at its tinniest, but Maniac Mansion's plot is enough to overcome these faults.

In the early 1990s, LucasArts tasked Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer, both of whom had worked on the ''Monkey Island'' series, with designing a sequel to ''Maniac Mansion''. Gilbert and Winnick initially assisted with the project's writing. The team included voice acting and more detailed graphics, which Gilbert had originally envisioned for ''Maniac Mansion''. The first game's nonlinear design was discarded, and the team implemented a [[Chuck Jones]]-inspired visual style, alongside numerous puzzles based on time travel. Bernard and the Edison family were retained.<ref name="RetroMaking">{{cite journal |journal=Retro Gamer |publisher=Imagine Publishing |location=Bournemouth |title=The Making Of Day Of The Tentacle |first=Kim |last=Wild |issue=81 |date=September 2010 |pages=84–87 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Wild |first=Kim |title=Developer Lookback – LucasArts – Part Two |journal=Retro Gamer |publisher=Imagine Publishing |location=Bournemouth |issue=28 |date=August 17, 2006 |pages=20–25 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015}}</ref> The sequel ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'' was released in 1993,<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/> and came with a fully playable copy of ''Maniac Mansion'' hidden as an Easter egg within the game.<ref name="GSGG">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041124031943/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |archive-date=November 24, 2004 |title=The Greatest Games of All Time: The Only Good Tentacle Is a Green Tentacle |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=April 30, 2004 |access-date=February 13, 2014}}</ref>

==Impact and legacy==
In 2010, the staff of ''GamesTM'' dubbed ''Maniac Mansion'' a "seminal" title that overhauled the gameplay of the graphic adventure genre. Removing the need to [[Syntax guessing|guess syntax]] allowed players to concentrate on the story and puzzles, which created a smoother and more enjoyable experience, according to the magazine.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/> Eurogamer's Kristan Reed agreed: he believed that the design was "infinitely more elegant and intuitive" than its predecessors and that it freed players from "guessing-game frustration".<ref name="EuroGamer"/> Designer [[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]], who worked on Lucasfilm Games' later ''Day of the Tentacle'' and ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'', felt that ''Maniac Mansion'' had revolutionized the adventure game genre.<ref name="RG2011" /> Although 1985's ''Uninvited'' had featured a point-and-click interface, it was not influential. ''Maniac Mansion''{{'}}s implementation of the concept was widely imitated in other adventure titles. Writing in the [[game studies]] journal ''Kinephanos'', Jonathan Lessard argued that ''Maniac Mansion'' led a "[[Casual game|Casual]] Revolution" in the late 1980s, which opened the adventure genre to a wider audience.<ref name=kinephanos>{{cite journal|journal=Kinephanos |title=The Casual Revolution of... 1987: Making adventure games accessible to the masses |date=January 2014 |last=Lessard |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.kinephanos.ca/2014/adventure-games/ |access-date=September 26, 2015 |issn=1916-985X |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928094408/http://www.kinephanos.ca/2014/adventure-games/ |archive-date=September 28, 2015}}</ref> Similarly, Christopher Buecheler of [[GameSpy]] called the game a contributor to its genre's subsequent critical adoration and commercial success.<ref name="GS-Fame"/>

Reed highlighted the "wonderfully ambitious" design of ''Maniac Mansion'', in reference to its writing, interface, and cast of characters.<ref name="EuroGamer"/> Game designer [[Sheri Graner Ray]] believed the game to challenge "[[damsel in distress]]" stereotypes through its inclusion of female protagonists.<ref name="graner">{{cite book |first=Sheri |last=Graner Ray |author-link=Sheri Graner Ray |title=Gender Inclusive Game Design: Expanding the Market |page=24 |publisher=Charles River Media |location=[[Hingham, MA]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58450-239-5}}</ref> Conversely, writer [[Mark Dery]] argued that the goal of rescuing a kidnapped cheerleader reinforced negative [[gender role]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture |first=Mark |last=Déry |author-link=Mark Dery |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |location=[[Durham, NC]] |year=1994 |chapter=[[Anne Balsamo]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/flamewarsdiscour00dery/page/152 152] |isbn=978-0-8223-1540-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/flamewarsdiscour00dery/page/152}}</ref> The Lucasfilm team built on their experiences from ''Maniac Mansion'' and became increasingly ambitious in subsequent titles.<ref name="ClassicIntro"/> Gilbert admitted to making mistakes—such as the inclusion of [[no-win situation]]s—in ''Maniac Mansion'', and he applied these lessons to future projects. For example, the game relies on [[Time-driven programming|timers]] rather than [[Event-driven programming|events]] to trigger cutscenes, which occasionally results in awkward transitions: Gilbert worked to avoid this flaw with the [[Monkey Island (series)|''Monkey Island'' series]].<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/> Because of ''Maniac Mansion''{{'}}s imperfections, Gilbert considers it his favorite among the games he made.<ref name="GDC-Post"/>

According to writers Mike and Sandie Morrison, Lucasfilm Games became "serious competition" in the adventure genre after the release of ''Maniac Mansion''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Magic of Interactive Entertainment |url=https://archive.org/details/magicofinteracti0000morr |url-access=registration |publisher=[[SAMS Publishing]] |location=[[Indianapolis, IN]] |first1=Mike |last1=Morrison |first2=Sandie |last2=Morrison |chapter=The History of Interactive Entertainment |date=October 1994 |page=[https://archive.org/details/magicofinteracti0000morr/page/48 48] |isbn=978-0-672-30590-0}}</ref> The game's success solidified Lucasfilm as one of the leading producers of adventure games:<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/> authors Rusel DeMaria and Johnny Wilson described it as a "landmark title" for the company. In their view, ''Maniac Mansion''—along with ''[[Space Quest I|Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter]]'' and ''[[Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards]]''—inaugurated a "new era of humor-based adventure games".<ref>{{cite book |title=High score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games |edition=2 |first1=Rusel |last1=DeMaria |first2=Johnny |last2=Wilson |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York City |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-07-223172-4 |pages=140, 200}}</ref> This belief was shared by Reed, who wrote that ''Maniac Mansion'' "set in motion a captivating chapter in the history of gaming" that encompassed wit, invention, and style.<ref name="EuroGamer"/> The SCUMM engine was reused by Lucasfilm in eleven later titles;<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/> improvements were made to its code with each game.<ref name="GDC-Post"/> Over time, rival adventure game developers adopted this paradigm in their own software. ''GamesTM'' attributed the change to a desire to streamline production and create enjoyable games.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/> Following his 1992 departure from LucasArts—a conglomeration of Lucasfilm Games, [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]] and [[Skywalker Sound]] formed in 1990—Gilbert used SCUMM to create adventure games and ''[[Backyard Sports series|Backyard Sports]]'' titles for [[Humongous Entertainment]].<ref name="GDC-Post"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/short-history-lucasarts |title=A Short History of LucasArts |author=Edge Staff |publisher=Edge Online |date=August 28, 2006 |access-date=April 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813202111/http://www.edge-online.com/features/short-history-lucasarts |archive-date=August 13, 2012}}</ref>
