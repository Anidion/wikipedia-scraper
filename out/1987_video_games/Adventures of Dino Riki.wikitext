'''''Adventures of Dino Riki''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Shin Jinrui: The New Type'''''|新人類||lit. "New Humans"}}, is a [[Shoot 'em up#scrolling shooter|scrolling shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Hudson Soft]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The player takes on the role of the titular Dino Riki in a prehistoric setting, tasked with completing a series of [[Vertically scrolling video game|vertically-scrolling]] stages while contending with various enemies, [[platformer|platforming]] sections, and [[boss (video games)|bosses]]. [[Power-up]]s that improve the player's weapons or mobility can be uncovered by hitting boulders scattered about each stage.

Japanese magazines previewed it as an [[action game]] with unique mechanics before it was converted into a scrolling shooter just prior to launch. Hudson had desired to release a game similar to [[Konami]]’s 1986 [[MSX]] shooter ''[[Knightmare (1986 video game)|Knightmare]]''. The ''Adventures of Dino Riki'' development staff has only been revealed through [[social media]] posts. Wrestler [[Riki Choshu]] lent his name and likeness to the project and was featured prominently in its Japanese advertising.

Due to a five game-per-year limit imposed by [[Nintendo]] on its licensees, Hudson partnered with electronics corporation [[Ricoh]] to get ''Adventures of Dino Riki'' released in Japan under the briefly-established Rix Soft label in early 1987. Hudson self-published it in North America in late 1989. It was met with average review scores and mixed opinions regarding its graphics, gameplay, and difficultly.

''Adventures of Dino Riki'' is a [[Shoot 'em up#scrolling shooter|scrolling shooter]] where the player takes on the role of the titular, primitive human Dino Riki in a prehistoric setting with dinosaurs. Each stage [[Vertically scrolling video game|scrolls vertically]] with the objective being to avoid enemies and their projectiles then to defeat the [[boss (video games)|boss]] at its end. Dino Riki can move in all directions, jump, and throw weapons to destroy enemies and uncover health and [[power-up]]s from boulders strewn about the landscape. These power-ups include speed boosts, wings that enable flight, and enhanced weapons. The player begins with rocks which can be upgraded to stone axes, then boomerangs, and finally torches, each consecutively improving range and spread of attack. A hidden item tile will transform the player into Macho Riki who can fire powerful projections of himself.<ref name="HCG101">{{cite web | author=Barbato, Steven | date=May 6, 2020 | title=''Adventures of Dino Riki, The'' | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/adventures-of-dino-riki-the/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231210164654/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/adventures-of-dino-riki-the/ | archive-date=December 10, 2023 | website=[[Hardcore Gaming 101]] | accessdate=June 20, 2024}}</ref>

The game has four stages with the last of these consisting of four sub-stages.  Some stages contain environmental hazards. For instance, the first features [[platform game|platforming]] sections with a bodies of water and lilypads that the player must jump or fly across. Some lilypads move back and forth while others submerge then resurface. Falling into the water results in instant death. Taking a hit from an enemy will drop speed and weapon upgrades down one level while dying will remove all power-ups and bring the player back to specific checkpoints.<ref name="HCG101"/>

==Development and release==
''Adventures of Dino Riki'' was developed by [[Hudson Soft]].

The game's development team was never made public by Hudson, but former employees have mentioned its history through [[social media]] posts. ''[[Gemaga|Beep]]'' magazine columnist [[:ja:岩崎啓眞|Hiroaki Iwasaki]] interviewed some of the company's personnel. [[video game programmer|Programmer]] Satoshi Mikami told Iwasaki that he was not involved in the production but claimed that Hudson wished to release a scrolling shooter similar to [[Konami]]’s ''[[Knightmare (1986 video game)|Knightmare]]'', first available for the [[MSX]] in 1986.

''Adventures of Dino Riki'' received consistently mediocre review scores but drew a mixed response from critics who disagreed on its presentation, gameplay quality, and challenge level.

''[[RhythmOne#AllGame|AllGame]]''’s Brett Alan Weiss called the game "easy to learn, yet challenging enough for most action fans." Weiss opined that the scenery could be dull at times, but that the variety of swarming enemies would be enough to keep a player busy.<ref name="AllGame"/> ''[[Hardcore Gaming 101]]'' contributor Steven Barbato was also complimentary of its overall presentation and assortment of enemies but labelled the platforming segments the game's biggest weakness, especially when the player collects too many speed powerups. "While skilled players can hold onto a flight power-up to bypass some of these platforming sections, it won’t take long for most people to become utterly demoralized," he concluded.<ref name="HCG101"/> A later issue of ''Game Players'' opined that the game, alongside Hudson Soft's ''[[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]]'', would most likely be too difficult for inexperienced or younger players.<ref>{{cite magazine | author=''Game Players'' staff | date=November 1990 | title=A Parents Guide to Games for the Younger Set: Hudson Soft | url=https://archive.org/details/game-players-strategy-guide-to-nintendo-games-vol.-3-no.-6-november-1990/page/22/mode/1up | magazine=[[Game Players]] | publisher=Signal Research | volume=3 | issue=6 | page=22 | issn=1087-2779}}</ref> Damien McFerran of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' considered ''Adventures of Dino Riki'' among Hudson's weakest games when chronicling the company's past. "Terrible graphics, a steep learning curve and an over-reliance on power ups (lose them and you may as well reset the game) result in a title so poor it's not surprising no one's heard of it," he said of the game. "And there are hardly any dinosaurs in it."<ref>{{cite magazine | author=McFerran, Damien | date=August 2009 | title=From the Archives: Hudson Soft – Part 1 | url=https://archive.org/details/revistas-brasileiras-de-games-da-net/Retro%20Gamer%20-%20revistas/2009/Retro%20Gamer%20%E2%84%9666/page/72/mode/1up | magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] | publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] | issue=66 | page=72 | issn=1742-3155}}</ref>

In October 1991, South Korean developer [[Zemina]] released unlicensed ports of ''Adventures of Dino Riki'' to the [[MSX]] and [[Master System]] under the title ''Wonsiin'' ({{Korean|원시인|lit="Primitive Man"}}). It features altered versions of the original game's first three stages and omits the final stage altogether. A sequel to ''Wonsiin'' was announced in 1992 but was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web | author=Derboo, Sam | date=March 2014 | title=A History of Korean Gaming: 재미나 Zemina / 새한상사 Saehan Sangsa | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-zemina-old.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514192855/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-zemina-old.htm | archive-date=May 14, 2017 | website=[[Hardcore Gaming 101]] | accessdate=June 21, 2024}}</ref>
