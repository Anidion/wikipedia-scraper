'''''Dark Sceptre''''' is a [[strategy game|strategy]] [[adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]] by [[Mike Singleton]]'s design team [[Maelstrom Games]], for [[Beyond Software]]. It was published by [[Firebird Software]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]]<ref>{{WoS game|id=0001259}}</ref> and for the [[Amstrad CPC]] in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]].<ref>[http://www.cpczone.net/index.php?game=1021 ''Dark Sceptre''] at CPCZone</ref>

==Gameplay==
The task in ''Dark Sceptre'' is to recover the [[eponym]]ous artefact. The player controls a company of warriors by assigning them specific tasks, and is hindered by six other computer-controlled factions. The main display shows a side-view of the currently watched warrior, which scrolls and tracks him as he moves through the game world. Each warrior has a rank, ranging from [[Thegn|Thane]], the team leader, to [[Thrall]], the pawn of the game. Other ranks include Mystics, Heralds, Savages and Assassins.

Play is real-time, with the player pausing to issue commands in Plan mode and then viewing results in Watch mode. Commands are selected from a menu screen and range from character-targeting actions such as KILL, AVOID, BRIBE or STALK, object related actions like SEEK, TAKE, USE, or location-based actions like DEFEND or ROAM.

''Dark Sceptre'' was well received by critics on its release. ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' awarded ''Dark Sceptre'' 9 out of 10, highlighting "nifty graphics and sound" and the easy-to-play design.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gerrard |first=Mike |date=January 1988 |title=Dark Sceptre review |journal=Your Sinclair |issue=25 |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/darksceptre.htm |access-date=2007-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411035743/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/darksceptre.htm |archive-date=2001-04-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' awarded it 10 out of 10, also impressed with the menu system, with the large variety of commands opening up an "almost infinite" number of strategies. The reviewer felt it was fascinating to issue commands and then watch what happens, concluding that it was an original and dramatic game.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Graham |date=November 1987 |title=Dark Sceptre review |journal=Sinclair User |issue=68 |page=92 }}</ref> ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' magazine awarded it 88%, highlighting the large, animated sprites that avoided the Spectrum's [[attribute clash]]. The only criticism was with the lack of detailed instructions, with the reviewer spending a lot of time trying to discover the objective of the game and working out which characters are best to befriend.<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 1987 |title=Dark Sceptre review |journal=CRASH |issue=47 |page=11 }}</ref>

==Other versions==
Maelstrom Games had also designed a [[play by mail]] version of ''Dark Sceptre''. Players sent in their turns via [[ZX Microdrive]] cartridge, whilst Singleton adjudicated the whole game.<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 1986 |title=Multi-user boom |journal=ZX Computing |issue=8608 |page=7 }}</ref> This version of the software allowed two modes of display: Replay and Simulation. Replay allowed the player to select a character and watch events that occurred since his last turn, whilst Simulation predicts the events in the game based on the player's orders to his warriors.<ref>{{cite journal |date=May 1986 |title=Can You Beat Mike Singleton? |journal=CRASH |issue=28 |page=56 }}</ref>
