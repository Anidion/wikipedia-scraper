'''''Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards''''' is a [[graphic adventure game]], developed by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]], and published in 1987. It was developed for the PC, [[DOS]], and the [[Apple II]] and later [[porting|ported]] to other platforms, such as the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]], [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh]], and [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Tandy Color Computer 3]]. It utilizes the [[Adventure Game Interpreter]] (AGI) engine. In 1991, Sierra released a [[Video game remake|remake]] titled '''''Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards''''' for PC DOS, Apple Macintosh, and Amiga. This version used the [[Sierra Entertainment#1980s|Sierra]]'s Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine, featuring 256 colors and a [[point-and-click]], [[Computer icon|icon]]-driven (as opposed to the original's text-based) [[user interface]].

The game's story follows its [[player character]] of a middle-aged male virgin named [[Larry Laffer]] as he desperately tries to "[[sexual intercourse|get lucky]]" in the fictional American city of Lost Wages. ''Land of the Lounge Lizards'' establishes several elements which recur in the later ''[[Leisure Suit Larry]]'' games, including Larry's [[Camp (style)|campy]] attire, perpetual bad luck with women, and penchant for [[double-entendre]]s. The game's overall plot and basic structure follow that of ''[[Softporn Adventure]]'', Sierra's own 1981 Apple II [[interactive fiction|text adventure]] that did not feature Larry.

Despite a lack of advertising, the game was a [[sleeper hit]] and a commercial and critical success. It was followed by a long series of sequels and spin-offs over decades, beginning with ''[[Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)]]'' in 1988. A second, high-definition remake, titled ''[[Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded]]'', was developed by N-Fusion Interactive working with the ''Larry'' series' creator [[Al Lowe]] and published by Replay Games in 2013.
{{TOC limit|2}}

== Plot ==
The protagonist, [[Larry Laffer]], is a 38-year-old (40-year-old in the 1991 remake) "loser" who lives in his mother's basement and has not yet lost his virginity. Having grown weary of his lonely existence, he decides to visit the resort city of Lost Wages (a parody of "[[Las Vegas]]") hoping to experience what he has not lived before and to finally find the woman of his dreams. Larry starts with nothing but an out-of-style 1970s [[disco]]-era [[leisure suit]] and $94 in his pocket. His quest involves four possible women: a nameless, seedy-looking [[sex worker]]; Fawn, a club-goer of low moral fiber; Faith, a receptionist who (true to her name) is faithful to her boyfriend; and Eve, a bathing beauty and Larry's ultimate goal.

== Gameplay ==
Players control Larry's movements with the directional keys and by inputting commands into a [[text parser]] (e.g. "talk to man", "open window", etc.). If Larry is too far away from a person or object to comply, or if the command is invalid, a caution message appears with hints on what to do.

The game begins outside a bar in Lost Wages. The city consists of five areas: Lefty's Bar, a hotel-casino, a 24-hour [[wedding chapel]], a [[discothèque|disco]], and a convenience store.<ref name="1up">{{cite web|last=Kohler|first=Chris|title=Two Decades of Leisure Suit Larry|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3161878|archive-url=https://archive.today/20071013053140/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3161878|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 13, 2007|work=1UP.com|date=August 10, 2007|access-date= 2009-02-20}}</ref> The player can walk between areas that are next to each other, but other areas can only be accessed by hailing a taxi, which costs the player money; failure to do so results in Larry's being mugged or hit by oncoming traffic. During the early stages of the game, Larry can survive most premature deaths. In the original release, a compartment opens beneath Larry's body and takes him to a laboratory where heroes from Sierra's computer games—such as ''[[King's Quest]]''—are re-assembled; in the remake, Larry's remains are instead thrown inside a blender and reformed.<ref name="hc101">{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/lsl/lsl.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Leisure Suit Larry|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613032246/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/lsl/lsl.htm|archive-date=13 June 2014|access-date=2010-02-02}}</ref>

Larry's interactions with key women are accompanied by a detailed image of whomever he is speaking with, unlike other [[non-player character]]s. With the exception of the prostitute, each of the women shuns Larry at first but responds favorably to gifts of varying sorts. Although it is not possible to woo all of the women, giving gifts is needed to advance to the game's final area, the hotel penthouse. To this end, money is essential to advance through the game. The only available method of augmenting Larry's funds is to gamble in the casino, playing [[blackjack]] and [[slot machine|slots]].<ref name="hc101" />

Players are given seven real-time hours (eight in the 1991 remake) to complete the game, at which point a despairing Larry commits suicide, resulting in [[game over]].<ref name="hc101" /> A prostitute is available as soon as the game starts. Should Larry have unprotected intercourse with her, he will contract a [[sexually transmitted disease]] and die shortly thereafter.<ref name="1up" /><ref name="hc101" /> This fate may be avoided by buying a condom at the convenience store. Larry questions the validity of losing his virginity to a prostitute, but the game resumes without a time limit.<ref name="hc101" />

== Development and release ==
[[Al Lowe]], a former high school teacher, had carved a niche for himself at Sierra with his work on such [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-licensed [[edutainment]] titles as ''[[Donald Duck's Playground]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood]]'', and ''[[The Black Cauldron (video game)|The Black Cauldron]]'', which he wrote, designed and programmed.<ref name="acg">{{cite web|last=Morrissette |first=Jess |title=Al Lowe Interview |url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/124/ |work=Adventure Classic Gaming |date=8 October 1999 |access-date=January 28, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131074111/http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/124 |archive-date=31 January 2015 }}</ref> In 1982, Sierra had released a text-only game on the Apple II titled ''[[Softporn Adventure]]'' (it was the only [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]] that was released by a company which had established its name on providing a graphical alternative to such games). In 1986, after Sierra lost a Disney license,<ref name="ny">{{cite news|first=Alan |last=Danzis |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/gamereport/leisure_suit_larry_creator_making_Z6I5YvLcAW15aqgSFTSx9N |title=''Leisure Suit Larry''{{'}}s Creator on Making a Remake, But Not Really Making One… |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |date=June 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108084927/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/gamereport/leisure_suit_larry_creator_making_Z6I5YvLcAW15aqgSFTSx9N |archive-date=2012-11-08 }}</ref> Al Lowe suggested that Sierra should [[remake]] ''Softporn Adventure'' with the improved tools now at their disposal, and [[Ken Williams (game developer)|Ken Williams]] agreed.<ref name=1up />

Lowe, who considered the original ''Softporn Adventure'' "a primitive, early effort", borrowed its basic structure and added a graphic [[game engine]] (Sierra's [[Adventure Game Interpreter]] made famous by 1984's ''[[King's Quest: Quest for the Crown]]''), improvised humor, and an [[player character|on-screen protagonist]], Larry Laffer.<ref name="hc101" /><ref name=1up /> Chuck Benton, creator of ''Softporn Adventure'', is included in the ''Leisure Suit Larry's'' end credits, as the game's layout and puzzles are identical to those found in the earlier title.<ref name="1up" /> However, Lowe said that in ''Softporn Adventure'' "there were no characters in the game. There was no central character at all. There were almost no characters to the women. And so it was a real role-over. I think there's one line of dialogue that I kept of the original game and all the rest was fresh."<ref name="ny" /> The game was co-designed and illustrated by [[Mark Crowe]], creator of the ''[[Space Quest]]'' series, and co-programmed by Ken Williams. An accomplished [[jazz]] musician ([[The Lounge Lizards]] being a jazz band's name), Lowe also wrote the main theme music (called "For Your Thighs Only"), and some of his compositions appear in later entries of the series.<ref name="hc101" /> The theme, inspired by [[Irving Berlin]]'s 1929 song "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]", was composed within 20 minutes. Lowe said it "sounded so unusual, so different, so fresh compared to most [[Video game music|computer game music]], that I decided to write something with the same pep, simplicity, humor, and out-of-sync attitude."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allowe.com/Larry/themecreation.htm |title=Creating the Larry Theme Song |website=Al Lowe's Humor Site |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114052540/http://www.allowe.com/Larry/themecreation.htm |archive-date=2013-01-14 }}</ref>

Unsure of how the 1987 game would be received, Sierra's management chose to release it with no publicity or advertising budget. Due to its adult nature, the game includes an age verification system consisting of trivia questions that Al Lowe assumed children would not know the answers to.<ref name="hc101" /><ref name="newstatesman">{{cite web|last=Hogge |first=Beckey |title=How to Catch a Humbert – Could a "yoof" questionnaire help identify internet paedophiles? |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200607310047 |work=NewStatesman.com |access-date=2009-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606044855/http://www.newstatesman.com/200607310047 |archive-date=June 6, 2011 }}</ref> As many of the questions are U.S.-centric, they risked frustrating non-American players.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Brillig|title=Naughty, but quite nice|newspaper=[[Atari ST User]]|volume=3 |issue=1|pages=27|date=March 1988}}</ref> If played today, the questions also include out-of-date cultural references. (One question begins "[[O. J. Simpson|OJ Simpson]] is..." and one wrong answer is "[[O. J. Simpson murder case|under indictment]].") In the original AGI version, the age verification screen may be skipped by pressing Alt-X (in the 1991 remake, it is done by pressing Ctrl-Alt-X).<ref name="newstatesman" />

Other key people included Stuart Moulder (producer), William R. Davis Sr. (creative director), William D. Skirvin (art designer), [[Mark Seibert]] (music director), Oliver Brelsford (lead programmer), and the music other than the theme song was composed by Chris Braymen. The suggested standard retail price of the 1991 version was $59.95, but Sierra offered owners of the original game an upgrade to the new game for $25.<ref name="cgw199107">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=84 |title=Available July 1! |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=July 1991 |access-date=18 November 2013 |pages=15 |type=advertisement |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000650/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=84 |archive-date=3 December 2013 }}</ref>

Sierra received what Williams described as a "deluge" of mail opposing its release of ''Larry'' after he wrote a series of articles for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' discussing his company and the industry's views on adult software.{{r|CGW}} Sales were very poor at first, with only 4,000 copies sold upon its release.<ref name=ag /> Many stores refused to stock the game because of its adult content. Some resellers refused to handle the game, while others refused to advertise it, and one refused to list the game on its list of best sellers. In effect, its first-month sales were lower than any new Sierra product launch in years.<ref name="1up" /> A Sierra employee quit and a potential employee refused to work on ''Larry''.{{r|CGW}} Lowe stated, "My initial reaction was that I had wasted six months of my life". Word-of-mouth spread quickly, however, and by the year's end, the game became a commercial success,<ref name="1up" /><ref name="acg" /> selling over 250,000 copies.<ref name=esquire>{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704192626/http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a26554/leisure-suit-larry-and-me/ | url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a26554/leisure-suit-larry-and-me/ | title=Before There Was Computer Porn, There Was This Guy |website=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] | date=January 10, 2014 | author=Rosen, Daniel Edward | archive-date=July 4, 2016 }}</ref> It sold over 300,000 units in total.<ref>{{cite book|date=September 1, 2008| author=Brown, Damon | title=Porn & Pong: How Grand Theft Auto, Tomb Raider and other Sexy Games Changed Our Culture | publisher=[[Feral House]] | at=45}}</ref> A significant number of players were female.<ref name=esquire />

''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''Land of the Lounge Lizards'' in 1987, stating that "At its best, ''Leisure Suit Larry'' surprises you with clever animations that make you laugh ... And at its worst, the game is offensive ... Larry's idea of an ideal mate is shallow even for a parody ... There are many examples of a fifties mentality that are meant to be satirical but just seem lame". ''Macworld'' criticises ''Leisure Suit Larry's'' portrayal of women further, stating that it "contributes nothing to enlightened male attitudes towards women". ''Macworld'' compares ''Leisure Suit Larry'' to ''[[Leather Goddesses of Phobos]]'', expressing that ''Leather Goddesses'' is "raunchy and humorous" without ''Leisure Suit Larry's'' "retrograde" portrayal of women.<ref>{{cite magazine|last = McCandless|first = Keith|title = How Not To Meet Women: Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards 1.0 Review|date = December 1987|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_8712_December_1987/page/n153|magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|page = 142}}</ref>
