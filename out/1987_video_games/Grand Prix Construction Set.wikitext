'''''Grand Prix Construction Set''''' is a [[racing video game]] for the [[BBC Micro]] released in 1987 by [[Superior Software]]. It is a [[simulation]] of [[Formula One]] coupled with a track editor.<ref>"Acorn User", issue 59, June 1987</ref> It can be played in full screen [[Single-player video game|single-player]] or [[Two-player video game|two-player]] split screen modes.

Unlike the majority of Superior's BBC Micro games at the time, it was not possible to convert the game to the [[Acorn Electron]] but a game that started out as an Electron equivalent became the BBC/Electron motorbike racing game ''[[Crazee Rider]]''.

==Legacy==
It was also available on the 1988 Superior Software compilation ''Play It Again Sam 4'', along with ''[[Frak!]]'', ''[[Cosmic Camouflage]]'', and ''[[Spellbinder (video game)|Spellbinder]]''.
