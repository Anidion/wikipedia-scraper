{{nihongo foot|'''''Dragon Spirit'''''|ドラゴンスピリット|''Doragon Supiritto''||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1987 [[shoot'em up|vertical-scrolling shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Namco]]. In North America, it was distributed by [[Atari Games]]. Controlling the dragon Amur, the player must complete each of the game's nine areas to rescue the princess Alicia from the demon Zawell. Similar to Namco's own ''[[Xevious]]'', Amur has a projectile weapon for destroying air-based enemies and a bomb for destroying ground enemies. It ran on the [[Namco System 1]] arcade board.

Music for the game was composed by [[Shinji Hosoe]] and designed by Tatsuya Ishikawa. Hosoe, previously a graphics artist for Namco, was allowed to work on the music himself due to most of the company's composers working on ''[[Genpei Tōma Den]]'', however much of his work was accidentally wiped from the hardware midway through development and forced him to start over. Ishikawa previously created character artwork for ''[[Rolling Thunder (video game)|Rolling Thunder]]'', being assigned to the project after taking interest in the enemy designs. The game was dedicated to Shouichi Fukatani, a Namco programmer who had died a few years earlier in 1985 and worked on many of the company's older games, such as ''[[Dig Dug]]'' and ''[[Super Pac-Man]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Szczepaniak |first1=John |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |date=11 August 2014 |isbn=978-0992926007 |pages=363 |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |edition=First |url=https://archive.org/details/TheUntoldHistoryOfJapaneseGameDevelopersVol.2JohnSzczepaniak/page/n361?q=cutie+q |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>

The game was ported to several home systems, including the [[Sharp X68000]], [[Atari ST]] and [[TurboGrafx-16]], and is included in several [[List of Bandai Namco video game compilations|Namco video game compilations]]. The arcade version of ''Dragon Spirit'' was met with positive reviews from critics for standing out amongst other shooter games, being praised for its Paleozoic setting, graphics and soundtrack. Home versions were met with a more mixed reception, being criticized for its high difficulty and inferior graphics and music. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Dragon Spirit: The New Legend]]'' (1988) and ''[[Dragon Saber]]'' (1990). A [[ShiftyLook]] webcomic adaptation of the game was also produced.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Dspirit.png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]
''Dragon Spirit'' is a vertical-scrolling shooter video game. The player controls the dragon Amur in his effort to rescue the princess Alicia from the serpent demon Zawell. Amur can move in eight directions and has access to two weapons; a flame projectile to destroy air-based enemies, and a bomb to destroy ground-stationed enemies, similar to Namco's ''[[Xevious]]'' series. Amur can take two hits before dying, indicated by a life bar at the bottom-left of the screen. Amur can use bombs to destroy eggs found on the ground of some stages, which will award one of two powerup items; a blue orb that will give Amur an extra head, granting him additional firepower, or an orange orb that will strengthen Amur's shots when three are collected.

The game features nine stages, which include large rivers, volcanoes, glaciers and jungles. Dying halfway through a stage will start the player at a checkpoint. At the end of each stage is a boss that Amur must fight in order to progress to the next stage. Amur can sometimes find special orbs throughout the game that can grant him additional abilities, such as a homing shot, a multi-shot, and the ability to shrink down in size to evade bullets. The game's opening cutscene shows Amur atop a mountain raising his sword in the air, with lightning striking it and transforming him into his dragon form. If the player makes it to the end of the ninth level and defeats Zawell, Princess Alicia will be seen held captive behind glass, which shatters as she yells "Amur!". The dragon then retransforms into human form and embraces Alicia, and an end scene is shown where the people of the kingdom are celebrating peace and prosperity now that Zawell's reign of terror is over.

==Development and release==
''Dragon Spirit'' was released in Japan by Namco on May 15, 1987, later licensed to [[Atari Games]] for release in North America. The game's music was composed by [[Shinji Hosoe]], originally a graphic designer for the company.<ref name="Interview">{{cite magazine|title=ドラゴンスピリット - 作曲担当: 細江慎治氏 ＆ デザイン担当: tatsuya氏|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=6|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=9 February 2013|pages=16–19|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896374100}} ([http://shmuplations.com/shinjihosoe/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190810125654/http://shmuplations.com/shinjihosoe/|date=2019-08-10}}).</ref> After asking ''[[Wonder Momo]]'' composer "Yudate" how to add music to the game code, he inserted many of his tracks during his own time — once the development team behind the game found out, he was automatically assigned as the game's composer.<ref name="Interview"/> During its development, Namco was low on composers as many of them went to work on ''[[Genpei Tōma Den]]'', allowing Hosoe to be able to compose the music himself.<ref name="Interview"/>

In North America and Europe, ''Dragon Spirit'' was ported to several home consoles and computers, including the [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]].<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Dragon Spirit |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragon-spirit/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |access-date=16 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322000622/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragon-spirit/ |archive-date=22 March 2019 |date=27 December 2011}}</ref> In Japan, Namco ported the game to the [[Sharp X68000]] and [[PC-Engine]], the latter being published in North America by [[NEC]] for the [[TurboGrafx-16]].<ref name="HG101"/> ''Dragon Spirit'' is included in several Namco video game compilations, such as ''Namco Museum Vol. 5'' (1997), ''Namco Museum 50th Anniversary'' (2005), ''[[Namco Museum Virtual Arcade]]'' (2008) and ''[[Namco Museum Essentials]]'' (2009). The TurboGrafx-16 conversion was digitally re-released onto the Wii Virtual Console in 2007, while the arcade version was released in 2009 exclusively in Japan. A version for Japanese mobile phones was released in 2003. Arcade version of ''Dragon Spirit'' was released under the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' label for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in 2022.

==Sequels and legacy==
A sequel game, ''[[Dragon Spirit: The New Legend]]'', was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1989 and published outside Japan by [[Bandai]]. Taking place several years after the events of the original, it adds many of the levels from the arcade version alongside new stages, enemies, boss fights and cinematic cutscenes, alongside a brand-new storyline.<ref name="HG101"/> A second sequel, ''[[Dragon Saber]]'', was released for arcades in 1990, running on the [[Namco System 2]] arcade board. Subtitled ''After Story of Dragon Spirit'', this game adds two-player co-operative play, charging shots and new enemy types. A PC-Engine version was released a year later in 1991, while the arcade version was released as part of the Japan-only ''Namco Museum Encore'' compilation. The PC-Engine conversion was released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2008, followed by the arcade version in 2009.

Amur appears as a playable character in the [[WonderSwan Color]] role-playing game ''[[Namco Super Wars]]'', alongside Princess Alicia.<ref name="HG101"/> Several players in the ''[[Family Stadium]]'' series would be named after Amur and the game itself. In 2012, a webcomic adaptation of ''Dragon Spirit'' was created for [[ShiftyLook]] a subsidiary of [[Namco Bandai Games]] that focused on reviving older Namco game franchises for use in comics and animations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carmichael |first1=Stephanie |title=Katamari's Prince rises as a webcomic star |url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/09/13/katamari-webcomic-on-shiftylook/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |access-date=16 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727192804/https://venturebeat.com/2012/09/13/katamari-webcomic-on-shiftylook/ |archive-date=27 July 2017 |date=13 September 2012}}</ref> Illustrated by artist Steve Cummings, the comic was a tongue'n cheek parody of the "damsel in distress" storyline used in fiction, featuring characters and settings taken from the arcade game. Nidia, a character from the webcomic, appeared as a character the player could date in the now-defunct browser game ''Namco High''. An arrangement of the Area 1 music from the game is available as a track in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' for use on the Pac-Land stage.
