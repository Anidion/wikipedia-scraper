{{nihongo foot|'''''Final Lap'''''|ファイナルラップ|Fainaru Rappu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1987 [[Sim racing|racing simulation]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Namco]].<ref name="CVG77" /> [[Atari Games]] published the game in the United States in 1988. It was the first game to run on Namco's then-new [[Namco System 2|System 2 hardware]] and is a direct successor to Namco's ''[[Pole Position]]'' (1982) and ''[[Pole Position II]]'' (1983). It was ported to the [[Famicom]] by [[Arc System Works]], making it Arc System Works' debut game.

''Final Lap'' was the first racing game to allow up to [[multiplayer video game|eight players]] to simultaneously race on the [[Suzuka Circuit]] in a [[Formula One]] race. This was, at the time, considered a revolutionary feature, and was implemented by linking together up to four two-player sitdown-style arcade cabinets. There was also a single-player mode, in which the player's [[score (gaming)|score]] was based on how far the car traveled until time ran out or if the player completed four laps. It was a major commercial success in Japan, becoming the third highest-grossing [[1988 in video games|arcade game of 1988]], the highest-grossing dedicated [[1989 in video games|arcade game of 1989]], and second highest dedicated [[1990 in video games|arcade game of 1990]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:FinalLap.png|thumb|left|Preparing to turn a corner (arcade)]]
The player drives Formula One cars of the 1987 season and may choose between [[Williams FW11|Williams-Honda]], [[Lotus 99T|Lotus-Honda]], [[McLaren MP4/3|McLaren-Porsche]], or [[March 871|March-Cosworth]]. 1987 was the first year a Formula One grand prix was held on the [[Suzuka Circuit]], the main track in the game. The track layout is reproduced accurately, going so far as to include sponsor [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]]s, but the length is greatly shortened, and it takes less than forty seconds to complete one lap in the game.

The Famicom version is mostly unrelated to the original arcade game, including more tracks and somewhat simpler game play. The Famicom version features both a single-player and two-player split screen mode. The game uses an upgrade system, rather than different cars. The game will slowly increase the computer controlled car's difficulty, requiring the player to continuously upgrade the car in order to keep up. The upgrades consist of engine upgrades, brake upgrades, tire upgrades, and extra boost. The game was released in Japan on August 12, 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/final-lap/3030-37092/releases/|title=Final Lap International Releases|website=Giant Bomb|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>
