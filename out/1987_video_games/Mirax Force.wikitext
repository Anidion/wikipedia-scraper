The player's mission in ''Mirax Force'' is to fly a fighter called Star Quest over the gigantic alien mothership, destroying as much of the main superstructure as possible, with the ultimate goal being the mothership's reactor. Many hazards such as tall pylons or buildings must be avoided, and while doing so, the player will come under intense attack from waves of defender ships protecting the mothership. The player's ship flies at a fixed altitude just above the surface of the mothership, with the screen scrolling horizontally in both directions.

==Reception==
''Mirax Force'' received very positive reviews. In the review for ''[[Atari User]]'' magazine, Neil Fawcett found the game's graphics and colors superb, together making "a stunning display".<ref name="atariuser"/> Similarly, Robert Fripp, who reviewed the game for ''[[Aktueller Software Markt]]'' magazine, ended his positive review with the words, "Buy this thing!".<ref name="asm"/>
