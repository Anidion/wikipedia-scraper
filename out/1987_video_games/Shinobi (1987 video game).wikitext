{{nihongo|'''''Shinobi'''''|忍}} is a [[side-scrolling]] [[hack and slash]] video game produced by [[Sega]], originally released for [[Arcade video game|arcades]] on the [[Sega System 16]] board in 1987. The player controls [[ninja]] [[Joe Musashi]], to stop the Zeed terrorist organization from kidnapping students of his clan.

''Shinobi'' was a commercial success in arcades; it topped the monthly Japanese table arcade charts in December 1987, and became a blockbuster arcade hit in the United States, where it was the highest-grossing [[1988 in video games|conversion kit of 1988]] and one of the top five [[1989 in video games|conversion kits of 1989]]. It was adapted by Sega to its [[Master System]] game console, followed by conversions to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[PC Engine]], and [[home computers]]. It was re-released as downloadable emulated versions of the original arcade game for the [[Wii]] and [[Xbox 360]]. The arcade game joined the [[Nintendo Switch]] in January 2020 through the ''[[Sega Ages]]'' series. ''Shinobi''{{'}}s success inspired various sequels and spin-offs of the [[Shinobi (series)|''Shinobi'' series]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Shin0000.png|thumb|left|In Stage 2–1, Musashi confronts an enemy keeping a kidnapped child hostage.]]

The controls of ''Shinobi'' consist of an eight-way joystick and three action buttons for attacking, jumping, and using [[ninjutsu]] techniques called "ninja magic". The player can walk, or perform a crouching walk by pressing the joystick diagonally downward. The player can jump to higher or lower floors by pressing the jump button while holding the joystick up or down. The protagonist [[Joe Musashi]]'s standard weapons are an unlimited supply of [[shuriken]]s, and punches and kicks. Rescuing certain hostages in each stage will grant him an attack upgrade replacing throwing stars with a gun, and his close-range attack becomes a [[katana]] slash. Musashi's ninjutsu techniques can only be used once per stage and will clear the screen of all enemies, or greatly damage a boss. Depending on the stage, the three ninjutsu techniques are a thunderstorm, a tornado, and a doppelganger attack.

Enemies include punks, mercenaries, ninjas, and the Mongolian swordsmen guarding each hostage. Musashi can bump into most enemies without harm and can only be killed if he gets struck by an enemy's attack, gets hit by a projectile, or falls into a bottomless hole. Then, the stage restarts but retains any saved hostages. When the player runs out of lives, additional coins will continue the game except the final mission. The time limit is three minutes per stage and bonus points are awarded for time, with additional bonuses for refraining from ninjutsu technique (except on the fifth level) or using only melee attacks. Extra lives are awarded for achieving certain scores, completing the bonus round, or rescuing a special hostage.

A [[bonus round]] has a first-person perspective of throwing shurikens at incoming enemy ninjas, for an extra life.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|title=Shinobi|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/shinobi/shinobi.htm|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=September 10, 2011}}</ref>

== Plot ==
A ninja named Joe Musashi must stop a criminal organization called Zeed from kidnapping the children of his ninja clan. Five missions consist of three stages in the first mission and four stages each in the rest, where Musashi approaches Zeed's headquarters and frees all the hostages in the first two or three stages with a boss at the final stage of each mission. At the start of each mission, the player is shown the objective, with a file containing a photograph of the enemy boss and a map display pinpointing the location of the next stage.

== Ports ==
===Master System===
Sega converted ''Shinobi'' to its [[Master System]] game console. It was released in Japan on June 19, 1988, and in North America and Europe. Some of the play mechanics were altered. Instead of one-hit kills, the player now has a health gauge before losing a life. Hostage rescue is now an optional task but provides upgrades to the close and long-range weapons, and restores or expands the health gauge. Rescuing certain hostages is a requirement to access the game's bonus stages, which now occur after the regular stages instead of each boss fight. Bonus rounds provide the ninjutsu skills.

===Home computers===
In 1989, conversions of ''Shinobi'' were released for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. All five were developed by The Sales Curve and published by [[Virgin Mastertronic]] in Europe and by Sega in North America except the Amstrad and Spectrum versions. An IBM PC version was developed by Micromosaics Inc. and released in North America by Sega.

===PC Engine===
A [[TurboGrafx 16|PC Engine]] version was released exclusively in [[Japan]] by [[Asmik Ace|Asmik]] on December 8, 1989. The graphics and play mechanics of the PC Engine version are similar to the arcade version's, but the close-range attacks and power-ups are missing and there are extra lives for points instead of bonus rounds. There is no life gauge, time limit, or Mission 2.

===Nintendo Entertainment System===
The [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version of ''Shinobi'' was released by [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] exclusively in [[North America]] as an unlicensed release in 1989. The play mechanics are based on the Master System's version, but without close-range weapons and grenades. All the vertical-scrolling stages (such as Mission 2-2 and Mission 3-2) were redesigned into horizontal-scrolling stages.

===Wii and Xbox 360===
The arcade version was published on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] and [[Xbox 360]]'s [[Xbox Live Arcade|Live Arcade]] services, with slight graphical modifications due to licensing issues over one character's resemblance to [[Spider-Man]].

===''Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection''===
''Shinobi'' is [[unlockable (gaming)|unlockable]] in ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] and Xbox 360 after the first round of ''[[Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master]]'' without using a continue.

The arcade game received critical acclaim. Clare Edgeley of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' noted it as one of several popular "[[martial arts]] simulation" games at [[London]]'s [[Amusement Trades Exhibition International]] (ATEI) show in January 1988, along with [[Taito]]'s ''[[Ninja Warriors]]'' and [[Data East]]'s ''[[Vigilante (video game)|Vigilante]]''; she said it plays similarly to ''Ninja Warriors'', but that ''Shinobi'' also has elements from [[Namco]]'s [[run and gun video game]] ''[[Rolling Thunder (video game)|Rolling Thunder]]'' (1986), introduces [[bonus stage]]s, and is more challenging overall. She praised the "clean colourful graphics" with large "well defined" sprites, and the action gameplay for being fast-paced and challenging, concluding that the game is "well worth playing".<ref name="CVG77">{{cite magazine |title=Arcade Action |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=February 1988 |issue=77 (March 1988) |pages=90–3 |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-077/page/n89/mode/2up}}</ref> Nick Kelly of ''[[Commodore User]]'' rated it 8 out of 10, also noting similarities to ''Rolling Thunder'' but said ''Shinobi'' looks good, "plays brilliantly", and "combines several kinds of [[Shoot 'em up|shoot'em]] and [[beat'em up]] action in one well-thought-out, well-executed game."<ref name="CU54">{{cite magazine |title=Arcades: Shinobi |magazine=[[Commodore User]] |date=February 26, 1988 |issue=54 (March 1988) |page=104 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/265/307}}</ref> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' also compared it to ''Rolling Thunder'' and other martial arts games, but considers ''Shinobi'' "sufficiently different to be familiar without being boring."<ref name="SU75"/> Retrospectively, ''[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]'' magazine in 2003 called ''Shinobi'' "one of the best martial arts arcade games of the 1980s".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Shinobi |journal=[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]] |date=September 2003 |volume=41 |issue=9 |page=132 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FtwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT8 |publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.}}</ref>

In 1989, Sega released a sequel called ''[[The Revenge of Shinobi (1989 video game)|The Revenge of Shinobi]]'' (''The Super Shinobi'' in Japan) as one of the first games for its new [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] game console.
