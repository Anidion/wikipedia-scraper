'''''Falcon''''' is a [[combat flight simulator]] video game and the first official entry (not counting the 1984's ''[[Falcon (series)#F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]]'') in the ''[[Falcon (series)|Falcon]]'' series of the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 jet fighter]]'s simulators by [[Spectrum HoloByte]]. Originally developed by Sphere for [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] and [[MS-DOS]] in 1987 and ported to several platforms between 1988 and 1992, the game earned commercial success and critical acclaim.

==Gameplay and development history==
[[Image:Falcon 1.0 in-game screenshot (Atari ST).png|thumb|left|The [[Atari ST]] version of ''Falcon'']]
The game was originally developed by Sphere, Inc. for the [[Macintosh]] and PC in 1987. [[Rowan Software]] ported ''Falcon'' for Spectrum HoloByte to the [[Atari ST]] in 1988 and [[Amiga]] in 1989, and the version for the [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]] was also published by Spectrum HoloByte and [[Mirrorsoft]] in 1992.

A [[Sega Genesis]] version intended to be compatible with the unreleased TeleGenesis Modem peripheral was planned but never released. In 1992, an updated release of the 1987 Macintosh version, called Falcon MC (Macintosh Color) was released; mostly identical to the original, but with color added. <ref name="CEv8i3">{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:ComputerEntertainer_US_Vol.8_03.pdf&page=11|title=The Video Game Update - Sega Genesis: 16-Bit Sophistication for Gamers - Gaming-by-phone / Third-Party Support for Genesis|magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]]|volume=8|issue=3|date=June 1989|page=11}}</ref><ref name="EGM3c3">{{cite magazine|last=Harris|first=Steve|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_03#page/n66/mode/1up|title=Outpost: Genesis — GENESIS SIZZLES AT CES!!!

In the original ''Falcon'', the players have their choice of flying one of 12 missions - with awards for flying missions at higher skill levels. There is a choice of different ground attack and air-to-air weapons, although these are also limited by several factors. For [[dogfight]]ing, [[AIM-9 Sidewinder#Air Force AIM-9E/J/N/P|AIM-9J]] missiles are not as reliable as newer [[AIM-9 Sidewinder#AIM-9L|AIM-9L]] missiles - and are useless for head-on attack - but were typically the only missiles available. Because they are guided, [[AGM-65]] missiles are easier to use than "iron dumb bombs" like the [[Mk 84]], but ineffective against strengthened targets. An [[Electronic countermeasure|ECM]] pod provides defense against enemy missiles, but occupies an external [[hardpoint]] that can be used for additional weapons or fuel. The enemy occupies the western areas of the game's playable map - itself a large square divided into 9 smaller squares. Enemy targets were fixed sites on the ground. For defense, the unnamed enemy was limited to [[MiG-21]] interceptors, and ground-launched missiles - either the [[SA-2]]s, which are launched from identified and fixed sites on the ground, or the [[SA-7]]s, which could be fired from portable launchers and can therefore appear anywhere.

''[[Compute!]]'' joked in 1989 that ''Falcon'' "seemed harder to fly than the real plane". That year Spectrum Holobyte released an update that reportedly made control and landings much easier.<ref name="atkin198911">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-11-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_114_1989_Nov#page/n19/mode/2up | title=Compute!

The Atari ST and Amiga versions of ''Falcon'' feature a semi-dynamic campaign where the player can roam the airspace, sweep for hostile aircraft, and attack ground targets. Destroyed buildings and SAM sites remain destroyed for fixed period of time, and hostile and friendly forces engage each other on the ground back and forth. Both of these versions have two expansion sets for them, '''''Falcon Operation: Counterstrike''''' and '''''Falcon Operation: Firefight''''' (released in Europe as ''Falcon Mission Disk Volume 2'') in 1989-1990.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1987 called ''Falcon'' as one of the most detailed and accurate flight simulators for the microcomputer market. It reported that an F-16 pilot with the [[474th Tactical Fighter Wing]] "gave it good marks for accuracy".<ref name="carey198802">{{cite magazine | title=Falcon / Spectrum HoloByte's F-16 Fighter Simulation | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=44 | date=February 1988 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_44.pdf | accessdate=23 April 2016| last=Carey | first=Regan | page=28}}</ref> ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave the DOS version 5 out of 5 stars,<ref name="Dragon132">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk|journal=Dragon|issue=132|date=April 1988|pages=80–85|url=https://archive.org/stream/DragonMagazine260_201801/DragonMagazine132#page/n85/mode/2up}}</ref> and 4 out of 5 stars for the MS-DOS version.<ref name="Dragon142">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser| last2=Lesser| last3=Lesser |first1=Hartley |first2=Patricia |first3=Kirk|journal=Dragon|issue=142|date=February 1989|pages=42–51|url=https://archive.org/stream/DragonMagazine260_201801/DragonMagazine142#page/n47/mode/2up}}</ref> ''Compute!'' praised ''Falcon''{{'}}s graphics, realism, and documentation.<ref name="hudson198807">{{cite news | url= https://archive.org/stream/1988-07-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_098_1988_Jul#page/n67/mode/2up | title=Falcon | work=Compute! | date=July 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Hudson, Steve | page=56}}</ref>

The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the TurboGrafx-16 version a 4.5 out of 10, opining that the conversion was over-ambitious, since the compromises which were made in order to fit the game into a 4 MB cartridge made it unenjoyable. They particularly criticized the awkward and difficult controls and the limited amount of action.<ref name=EGM>{{cite magazine|title=Review Crew: Falcon|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=36|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=July 1992|page=24|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_036|access-date=2018-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729080951/https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_036|archive-date=2018-07-29|url-status=live}}</ref>
