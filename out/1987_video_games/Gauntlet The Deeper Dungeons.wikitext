Invisibility amulets and healing potions are more common than in the original game, as is poisoned cider.<ref name="YS"/> There is a limit on item inventory, so if players pick up too many potions they will not have enough room for the keys they need.<ref name="CGamer"/>

It was released in 1987 by the British company [[U.S. Gold]] in the UK and Europe, and [[Mindscape (software publisher)|Mindscape]] in the United States for the Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum ports of ''Gauntlet''. It was developed by [[Gremlin Interactive|Gremlin Graphics]].

Many of its levels were entries in a competition throughout Europe in which ten winners were awarded prizes, a ''Gauntlet'' T-shirt and a copy of the program for their computers.<ref>''Gauntlet: The Deeper Dungeons'' instructions.</ref> The contest was announced in the instructions of many of the ported games.<ref>Original Gauntlet cassette tape version instructions released by U.S. Gold.</ref> The levels are presented randomly and its artwork is the side panel artwork of the arcade cabinet with only the main characters shown. The enemies were removed from the image and replaced with a pink background.

==Reception==
Reviewers noted that the levels were much harder than those in the original game, although the consensus was that it was not quite as good as the first game or the newly released arcade sequel.<ref name="YS">{{cite journal | title=The Deeper Dungeons review | first=Sara | last=Biggs | journal=Your Sinclair | issue=18 | date=June 1987 | page=58 | url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-18/YourSinclair_18_Jun_1987#page/n59/mode/1up | access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="sudedurv">{{ cite magazine | title=The Deeper Dungeons review | magazine=Sinclair User | issue=63 | date=June 1987 | page=49 | url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-063/SinclairUser_063_Jun_1987#page/n48/mode/1up | access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="ZXCom">{{cite journal | title=The Deeper Dungeons review | journal=ZX Computing | date=June 1986 |page=35 | url=https://archive.org/stream/zxcomputing-magazine-1987-06/ZXComputing_1987_06#page/n34/mode/1up | access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="CGamer">{{ cite journal | title=The Deeper Dungeons review | journal=Computer Gamer | date=June 1987 | issue=27 | page=73 | url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gamer_Issue_27_1987-06_Argus_Press_GB#page/n72/mode/1up | access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref>

Paul Rixon for ''[[Page 6]]'' said "''The Deeper Dungeons'' are simply more of the same – quite a lot more in fact."<ref name="page6">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Page_6_Issue_30_1987-11_ABACUS_GB/page/n81/mode/2up|title=Page 6 - Issue 30 (1987-11)(ABACUS)(GB)|date=November 23, 1987|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Tony Hetherington for ''[[Your Commodore]]'' said "If you enjoyed the original ''Gauntlet'' (if not, why not?) then you'll relish another 512 levels which could be training for things to come as ''Gauntlet II'' is now in most arcades."<ref name="yc">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/YourCommodoreIssue34Jul87/page/n83/mode/2up|title=Your_Commodore_Issue_34_Jul_87|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Sara Biggs for ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' said "If you're hooked on ''Gauntlet'', then you've probably already got your fiver put on one side for this. if you weren't convinced by the original, then you'll not be very interested, but I can't help it if you're soft in the head! Rollicking good fun – I love it!"<ref name="YS"/>

''[[Sinclair User]]'' said "''Deeper Dungeons'' extends ''Gauntlet'''s life, but only by cramming more of them same into the game. US Gold did right by sticking on a low price tag, you might even call this a budget release".<ref name="sudedurv"/>

''ZX Computing'' said "The graphics and gameplay are just as quick and impressive as the original which won't disappoint Gauntlet addicts but for a sequel I would have liked the inclusion of some new monsters and magic artefacts to collect."<ref name="ZXCom"/>

''[[Computer Gamer]]'' said "More of the same, no matter how devious, doesn't seem to be enough. At [the lower price] for another 512 levels no ''Gauntlet'' player is going to complain but it could have been so much better."<ref name="CGamer"/>
