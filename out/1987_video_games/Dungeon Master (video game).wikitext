'''''Dungeon Master''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] featuring a [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. It was developed and published by [[FTL Games]] for the [[Atari ST]] in 1987,<ref name=gamasutra>{{cite web

In contrast to the traditional [[turn-based game|turn-based]] approach that was, in 1987, most common, ''Dungeon Master'' added real-time combat elements (akin to [[Active Time Battle]]).<ref>{{cite book |first=Matt |last=Barton |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPPRBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA236 |title=Dungeons and Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games |page=236 |publisher=A. K. Peters, Ltd. |isbn=978-1-4398-6524-8|date=December 2008}}</ref> Other factors in immersion were the use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting. Abstract ''[[Dungeons & Dragons|Dungeons and Dragons]]'' style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters' skills were improved directly via using them. ''Dungeon Master'' was not the first game to introduce these features. ''[[Dungeons of Daggorath]]'' for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] first employed them in 1982. ''Dungeon Master'' was, however, responsible for popularizing these elements. Other features of ''Dungeon Master'' included allowing players to directly manipulate objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view.<ref name="milestone"/> It also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell's effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol.

While many previous games such as ''[[Alternate Reality (series)|Alternate Reality: The Dungeon]]'', ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]'', ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]],'' and ''[[Wizardry]]'' offered ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''-style role-playing, ''Dungeon Master'' established several new standards for [[role-playing video game]]s and first-person video games in general,<ref name="milestone">{{cite web|url=http://gameapparent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/Narrative_in%20Immersive-Video_Games.pdf|title=Exploring the Virtual Frontier: The Evolution of Narrative Form in Immersive Video Games|last=Stahl|first=Edwin Robert|year=2002|publisher=[[St Louis University]]|pages=44–45|access-date=2008-06-19|quote=''It was the most advanced RPG experience available and a true immersive milestone. [...] What made Dungeon Master so important [...] was its combination of a first-person 3D engine, point-and-click interface, and enveloping sound.''|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626030309/http://gameapparent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/Narrative_in%20Immersive-Video_Games.pdf|archive-date=2008-06-26}}</ref> such as the [[paper doll (gaming)|paper doll]] interface.

As Theron, the player cannot progress past the first section of the game until they have selected at least one and up to four champions from a small dungeon containing 24 mirrors, each containing a frozen champion. The frozen champions are based upon a variety of fantasy archetypes to allow diversity within the player's party.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dungeon Master Champions |url=http://dmweb.free.fr/?q=node/199 |website=Dungeon Master Encyclopaedia |access-date=23 June 2018}}</ref>

== Plot ==
Many champions have been sent into the dungeon with the quest to recover Librasulus' (the Grey Lord) firestaff. With the firestaff, Librasulus can take physical form again and defeat Lord Chaos. The player is Theron, the apprentice of the Grey Lord, that goes into the dungeon with the task to resurrect four champions, and guide them through the dungeon, to find the firestaff and defeat Lord Chaos.

If the player finds the firestaff and uses it to defeat Lord Chaos, this will be the real ending of the game. But there is also an alternative ending if the player finds the firestaff and then leaves the dungeon without destroying Lord Chaos.

== Development ==
Originally, Dungeon Master was started with the name ''Crystal Dragon'' coded in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and targeted the Apple II platform. Doug Bell and Andy Jaros (Artwork) began development in their development studio ''PVC Dragon'', before they joined in 1983 ''FTL Games''.<ref name=making/> It was finished there in [[C programming language]] and published in 1987 for the [[Atari ST]] first. A slightly updated [[Amiga]] version ported by Phil Mercurio was released the following year, which was the first video game to use [[3D audio effect|3D sound effects]].

''Dungeon Master'' was [[porting|ported]] later to many platforms like [[IBM PC compatible|PC]], [[Apple IIGS]], [[TurboGrafx-CD]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Sharp X68000]], [[PC-9801]] and [[FM Towns]]. The game was also [[translation|translated]] from [[English language|English]] into [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]].

According to "The Definitive CDTV Retrospective: Part II" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ninjaw.ifrance.com/cd32/_docs/cdtv%20retrospective%20ii.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318110950/http://ninjaw.ifrance.com/cd32/_docs/cdtv%20retrospective%20ii.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-03-18 |title= The Definitive CDTV Retrospective: Part II |author=Peter Olafson|access-date=2008-07-16 }}</ref> by Peter Olafson, Dungeon Master was ported to the Amiga CDTV but this version was never completed because FTL could not obtain reliable information from Commodore about saving games to memory cards.
Dungeon Master was also ported to Macintosh but never released.
There exists a prototype for the [[Atari Lynx]] under the name ''Dungeon Slayers''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://atariage.com/software_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=1979|title=Dungeon Slayers|website=[[AtariAge]]|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dodgson|first=Harry|url=http://atariage.com/forums/topic/191065-dungeonmaster-aka-dungeon-slayers-for-the-lynx/#entry2429654|title=DungeonMaster (aka "Dungeon Slayers") for the Lynx?|website=[[AtariAge]]|date=December 22, 2011|access-date=2019-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820024632/http://atariage.com/forums/topic/191065-dungeonmaster-aka-dungeon-slayers-for-the-lynx/#entry2429654|archive-date=2014-08-20|url-status=live}}</ref>

The packaging cover art was designed and illustrated by David R. Darrow,<ref>[http://dmweb.free.fr/?q=node/247#toc36 DM Original Artwork] - Dungeon Master Encyclopedia</ref> for which Andy Jaros posed as the leftmost character pulling on the torch. The woman in the scene was Darrow's wife, Andrea, and the muscular man in the background is unknown, but hired by Darrow from a local fitness club.<ref>[http://spelpappan.se/2013/09/this-is-how-the-cover-art-of-dungeon-master-1987-was-made/ This is how the cover art of Dungeon Master (1987) was made] - Spelpappan.se (2013)</ref> The painting itself is 25 to 30 inches high and doesn’t contain the word "Master". Darrow’s painting portrays a scene from the prologue in the manual for ''Dungeon Master''. It shows the three (or four) main characters' last few minutes alive, and is a portrayal of the player’s challenge to defeat the antagonist, Lord Chaos. The heroes in the painting are Halk the Barbarian, Syra Child of Nature, Alex Ander – and Nabi the Prophet who’s been reduced to a bunch of skulls.

A soundtrack album, titled ''Dungeon Master: The Album'', was released later. This album featured music composed by Darrell Harvey, Rex Baca, and Kip Martin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/GameBytes/issue18/misc/dmaster.html|title=DUNGEON MASTER: THE ALBUM from FTL.

==Reception==
''Dungeon Master'' debuted on 15 December 1987 on the Atari ST, and by early 1988 was a strong seller, becoming the best-selling game for the computer of all time; Bell estimated that at one point more than half of all Atari ST owners had purchased the game. Because of FTL's sophisticated [[copy protection]], many who otherwise pirated their software had to purchase ''Dungeon Master'' to play the game. The Amiga version was the first prominent game to require 1 MB of RAM, likely causing many to purchase additional memory; at least one manufacturer of Amiga memory bundled ''Dungeon Master'' with its memory-expansion kit. As with ''Wizardry'', many others offered for sale [[strategy guide]]s, [[game trainer]]s, and [[map editor]]s, competing with FTL's own hint book.<ref name="maher20151211">{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2015/12/dungeon-master-part-1-the-making-of/ | title=Dungeon Master, Part 1: The Making of | work=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2015-12-11 | access-date=11 December 2015 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref>

Hosea Battles Jr. of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1988 praised the attention to detail in the dungeons' graphics, allowing players to "practically feel the damp chill of the dungeons portrayed", as well as those of the monsters, including the multiple facial expressions on the ogres. He said the control system works "extremely well" and "one's adrenaline really flows because the game is in real-time." Battles also praised the extensive use of sound effects, uncommon to RPGs. He complained that the manual does not describe monsters or their attributes, of a "frustrating" shortage of food and water replenishments and that the lack of a map makes the game "extremely difficult". Battles called the game "fantastic" and said "It is a welcome addition to any fantasy player's library. Those who want a good fantasy/role-playing game will love this one."<ref name="CGW review">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=46 | title=In The Eye of a Beholder! | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=April 1988 | access-date=25 March 2016 | author=Battles, Hosea Jr. | pages=18–19}}</ref> [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] stated in the magazine in 1992 that the newly released IBM PC version's graphics "are surprisingly good, all things considered" despite the game's age, but wrote that "No endgame has ever given me so much trouble or frustration".

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' in 1988 called the story a "cliché" but praised the graphics, sound and controls. The reviewer said ''Dungeon Master'' is an example of a title which "changes the way we think about games" and a "must for all roleplayers".<ref name="CVG review">April 1988, ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' (issue 78), p. 92</ref> ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' called the game as "revolutionary" as ''[[Zork]]'' and ''[[History of Microsoft Flight Simulator#sublogicfs2|Flight Simulator II]]'', citing "spectacular" graphics and stating that the game was "almost worth buying for the sound-effects alone". Despite the "commonplace" story "where once again, an Evil Wizard has taken over control of the world", the magazine advised readers to "buy this game".<ref name="bernstein198805">{{Cite magazine |last=Bernstein |first=Harvey |date=May 1988 |title=New ST Entertainments / From dungeons to outer space |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v7n1/newstentertainment.html |magazine=Antic |volume=7 |issue=1}}</ref> ''[[ACE (games magazine)|Advanced Computing Entertainment]]'' said the graphics are "largely repetitive" but "wonderfully drawn" and wrote the "Sound is sparse but the effects are great." The reviewer called it a "thrilling game with plenty in it to keep you searching, fighting and pondering for a long time." He summarised the game as a "huge, immensely playable and very atmospheric mixture of role-playing and adventure.

The magazine praised the color and clarity of the monster graphics and the shading of the surroundings. It called the story and setting a "wholly engrossing scenario [which] creates a complete world which can be manipulated at will: its depth fully reflects the two years it took to program it. The presentation - an interesting and evocative novella neither too involved to prove turbid not too short to be unhelpful - is superb." The reviewer summarised: "Dungeon Master is a role-player's dream, but capable of providing a good deal of enjoyment for any ST owner."<ref name = "games machine">{{Cite magazine | date = April 1988 | magazine = [[The Games Machine]] | title = Men Down Under | url=https://archive.org/details/thegamesmachine-05/page/n63/mode/1up | issue=5 | pages = 64–65}}</ref> ''[[STart]]'' told readers to "be prepared to shed every preconception you ever had about computer games. This is Dungeon Master". Noting the strong sales, the reviewer called it "a true video game phenomenon" and reported that "not talking to my boyfriend for a week because he lost our master spell list was certainly not an overreaction".<ref name="brumbaugh1988summer">{{Cite magazine |last=Brumbaugh |first=Heidi |date=Summer 1988 |title=The Dungeon Master Experience |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n2/intothedungeon.html |magazine=STart |volume=3 |issue=2 #13}}</ref>

Kati Hamza of ''[[Zzap!64]]'' said of the Amiga version: "The first-person perspective ensures an incredibly realistic atmosphere - you just can't help really getting into the feeling of walking through damp echoing caverns looking for ghosts." The reviewer also said: "The puzzles are incredibly devious, the spell system is really flexible and the need to practise magic and spells gives the whole thing that extra-special depth." The reviewer asserted: "This has to be the most amazing game of all-time, anywhere, ever". In the same issue Gordon Houghton said: "This is just about the most incredible game I've ever seen. When you pick it up you find you lose whole days of your life." He said: "The best time to play it is late at night in a room by yourself - it's guaranteed to scare the life out of you. It's like ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'' in 3D, but about a hundred times better. If you enjoy arcade adventures, RPGs or combat games, but it: it's the perfect combination of all three." Reviewer Maff Evans professed to be little enthused by RPGs generally but said "I know a brilliant game when I see one and this is a brilliant game." He praised the scares delivered by ambushing monsters and said "you'd have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to be affected by the atmosphere". The magazine complained that saving games is "a bit laboured" but praised the "extremely detailed and accessible" controls, "interactive, detailed and extremely atmospheric" scenery and said the clarity of the graphics made the game an unusually accessible RPG. It summarized: "you'll be playing for months" and said ''Dungeon Master'' was "The best game we've ever seen".<ref name="zzap">{{cite magazine

=== Sequels and legacy ===
While ''Dungeon Master'' itself was inspired by early ''Ultima'' games,<ref name=making/> it amazed  ''Ultima'' developer [[Origin Systems]]'s employees; Origin founder [[Richard Garriott]] said that he was "ecstatic" at discovering the "neat new things I could do" in the game. It influenced ''[[Ultima VI]]''{{'}}s [[graphical user interface]] and seamless map,<ref name="maher20170407">{{Cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2017/04/ultima-vi/ |title=Ultima VI |last=Maher |first=Jimmy |date=2017-04-07 |website=The Digital Antiquarian}}</ref> and the later ''[[Ultima Underworld]]''.<ref name=ttlg>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010309140053/http://www.ttlg.com/articles/uw1.asp|archive-date=2001-03-09|url=http://www.ttlg.com/articles/uw1.asp |title=The Story of Ultima Underworld|author=Paul Neurath |access-date=2011-01-04|date=2000-06-23 |publisher=Looking Glass Studios}}</ref> Game journalist [[Niko Nirvi]] wrote that no 3D role-playing title before ''Ultima Underworld'' (1992) could challenge ''Dungeon Master'' as a game.

In 1989, FTL Games released a ''Dungeon Master'' sequel, ''[[Chaos Strikes Back]]''.

To date, ''Dungeon Master'' retains a small but faithful following online, with several [[fan-made]] ports and [[Video game remake|remake]]s available or in development.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clones|url=http://dmweb.free.fr/?q=view/Clones|quote=''Dungeon Master opened a new way for computer role-playing games, inspiring many developers.

[[Reverse engineering|Reverse engineered]] in six months work from the original by Paul R. Stevens, the available [[source code]] of CSBwin led to many ports for modern platforms like [[Windows]] and [[Linux]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/03/29/you-could-be-playing-dungeon-master-right-now/|title=You Could Be Playing Dungeon Master Right Now |first=John |last=Walker |date=2012-03-29 |access-date=2015-08-03 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |quote=''There is a version that just works, without an emulator, and it’s free. [...] A madman by the name of Paul Stevens spent six months, eight hours a day, writing 120,000 lines of what he calls "pseudo-assembly language" to rebuild it in C++. And then released the game and source code for free. Can he do that? I’ve decided that yes, he can, which legitimises my promoting it to you.''}}</ref> In 2014, Christophe Fontanel released another reverse engineering project which tries to recreate all existing versions and ports.<ref>[http://www.dungeon-master.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=29805 Back to the source: ReDMCSB] by Christophe Fontanel (18-Jan-2014)</ref>
