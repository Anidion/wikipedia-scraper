'''''The Last Ninja''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] originally developed and published by [[System 3 (company)|System 3]] in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. It was converted to the [[Apple IIGS]], [[MS-DOS]], [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] in 1988, the [[Apple II series]] in 1989, the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] (as '''''Last Ninja Remix''''') in 1990, and the [[Acorn Archimedes]] in 1991.

It is one of the most successful games released on the Commodore 64. It was followed by ''[[Last Ninja 2]]'' and ''[[Last Ninja 3]]''.

''The Last Ninja'' contains a blend of exploration, puzzle solving, and combat. The object of the game is to guide the [[ninja]] protagonist Armakuni on his journey to the palace of the evil [[shogun]] Kunitoki to assassinate him, avenge his clan, and retrieve the sacred scrolls. As the player progresses, Kunitoki's henchmen become more challenging as they learn the ways of the ninja.

The interface consists of the opponents' energy and collected inventory (on the right) and player's health (on the bottom). The world is viewed in an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] perspective allowing the player to move in eight directions. Movements are relative to the direction Armakuni is facing but restricted to predefined paths upon inaccessible scenery. Precision must be used when navigating and jumping around obstacles, traps, and fatal features of the terrain. By approaching and kneeling at certain landmarks, such as shrines to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and water fountains, an indication of what to collect next is revealed. These items are often hidden in trees or bushes and flash shortly after a new screen has been entered.

Attack moves are executed by combinations of directional controls with the fire button for attacking the opponent's head, torso and legs. Weapons, like the [[ninjato]], [[nunchaku]], [[Bō|staff]], [[shuriken]], and [[smoke bomb]]s, can be equipped.

==Development==
The program was originally developed for [[System 3 (company)|System 3]] in Hungary for almost a year by a team called SoftView<ref name="PixelHeroes">{{cite book |last=Beregi |first=Tamás |title=PixelHeroes - First 50 years of Computer Games |publisher=Vince Kiadó |year=2010 |pages=198–207 |isbn=978-963-303-023-3}}</ref> (an internal development team of [[Appaloosa Interactive|Novotrade Software]])<ref>{{Cite web |title=[Születésnaposok] 35 éves a The Last Ninja |url=http://www.pcguru.hu/hirek/szuletesnaposok-35-eves-a-the-last-ninja/68432 |access-date=2022-09-22 |website=PC Guru |language=HU}}</ref> but the financial advance for the work was refunded<ref name="GamesThatWerent">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/last-ninja-v1/|title=Last Ninja V1 (C64) - 1986 System 3 - GTW64|year=1986}}</ref> and the Hungarian team was uncredited for its work.<ref name="PixelHeroes" /> SoftView developed it in its proprietary [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]]-like language as a foundation for portability.

Cale said: "Basically, the whole idea – the whole concept – was mine. The vision of ''The Last Ninja'' as an isometric adventure was something I was very passionate about. Obviously, the machines back then weren't powerful enough to create fully 3D games, so an isometric viewpoint seemed to be the right solution to move away from the standard side-scrolling platform games. We wanted to do something a bit different, something that would really capture the imagination. And there really is no better subject matter than the idea of controlling a ninja, a spiritual warrior. We wanted to combine an arcade experience with adventure elements. So it wasn't like ''[[Double Dragon]]'', where you just go punch, kick, move, punch, kick, move… The whole idea was to solve a series of simple but realistic adventure puzzles. What we were essentially trying to do was take the square cursor blob from ''[[Adventure (1980 video game)|Adventure]]'' on the [[Atari 2600]] and turn it into a fully interactive 3D adventure".<ref name=rr/>
