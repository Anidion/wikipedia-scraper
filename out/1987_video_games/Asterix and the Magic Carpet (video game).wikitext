== Gameplay ==
''Asterix and the Magic Carpet'' starts as a graphical adventure game where the player chooses a character on the screen with a cursor and selects what he should say, which then influences how the rest of the game plays out. Occasionally, there a [[Pac-Man]]-like mini arcade games where Asterix has to defeat legionnaires, wild boars, or other enemies in a maze with the help of Obelix who oscillates back and forth in a fixed section of the maze. The general approach is to catch an enemy's attention, then run away and hide behind Obelix, who will hopefully defeat the enemy.
