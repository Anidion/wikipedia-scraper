'''''Stormbringer''''' is a [[Video game|computer game]] written by [[David Jones (programmer)|David Jones]] and released in 1987 by [[Mastertronic]] on the [[Mastertronic Added Dimension]] label. It was originally released on the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[MSX]]. A version for the [[Atari ST]] was published in 1988. It is the fourth and final game in the [[Magic Knight]] series. The in-game music is by [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]].

==Plot==
Magic Knight returns home, having obtained a second-hand time machine from the Tyme Guardians at the end of ''[[Knight Tyme]]''. However, there has been an accident whilst travelling back and there are now two Magic Knights - the other being "Off-White Knight", the dreaded Stormbringer (so called because of his storm cloud which he plans to use to destroy Magic Knight). Magic Knight cannot kill Off-White Knight without destroying himself in the process. His only option is to find Off-White Knight and merge with him.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay takes the form of a graphic adventure, with commands being inputted via the "Windimation" menu-driven interface, in the style of the previous two games, ''[[Spellbound (video game)|Spellbound]]'' and ''[[Knight Tyme]]'' (1986).

Magic Knight again has a limited amount of strength which is consumed by performing actions and moving from screen to screen as well as being sapped by various enemies such as the Stormbringer's storm cloud and spinning axes and balls that bounce around some rooms and should be avoided. The need for the player to monitor Magic Knight's strength and avoid enemies means that ''Stormbringer''s gameplay is closer to the [[arcade adventure]] feel of ''Spellbound'' rather than the much more pure graphic adventure feel of ''Knight Tyme''.

As with the previous two Magic Knight games, there are characters with whom Magic Knight can interact and have help him. Magic Knight's spellcasting abilities are also important for solving the game's puzzles including the "merge" spell to be used when he finds Off-White Knight.
