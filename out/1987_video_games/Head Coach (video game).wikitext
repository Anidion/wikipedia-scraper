==Reception==
Wyatt Lee reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Minus yardage for this program must focus on the keyboard interface which, while opening up creative possibilities on the one hand, slows down the game on the other. Minus yardage must also be applied for the lack of easily accessible files on real NFL teams."<ref name="CGW42">{{cite magazine |last=Lee |first=Wyatt |title=The Electronic Gridiron |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=December 1987 |volume=1 |issue=42 |pages=18}}</ref>
