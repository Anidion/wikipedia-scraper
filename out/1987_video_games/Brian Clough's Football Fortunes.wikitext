}}
Paul Rixon for ''[[Page 6]]'' said "C'mon CDS, you can do better than this. A great package but what about the program to go with it?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Page_6_Issue_29_1987-09_ABACUS_GB/page/n77/mode/2up|title=Page 6 - Issue 29 (1987-09)(ABACUS)(GB)|date=September 19, 1987|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Your Commodore]]'' said "Full marks must go to CDS software for their packaging of Brian Clough's Football Fortunes: the 'funny money', the cards, the board and the instructions all come together to make an excellent package – perhaps not family entertainment, but a great way to amuse your friends for an evening."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/YourCommodoreIssue38Nov87/page/n61/mode/2up|title=Your_Commodore_Issue_38_Nov_87|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Chris Holmes for ''[[Amiga Computing]]'' said "It's simple, it under-uses the Amiga and it is great."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Computing_Magazine_005/page/24/mode/2up|title=Amiga Computing Magazine 005|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Niels Reynolds for ''Apple User'' said "The balance achieved is just right, making for a great family game – and no crowd trouble."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AppleUserUKMagazineMay1987/page/n7/mode/2up|title=Apple User (UK) Magazine May 1987 [NEW SCAN]|date=May 1, 1987|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Warren Lapworth for ''[[The Games Machine]]'' said "A lot more of a board game than a computer one, ''Brian Clough's Football Fortunes'' will appeal to football fans and casual kick-about players alike."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Games_Machine_Issue_020/page/50/mode/2up|title=The Games Machine Issue 020|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Terry Pratt for ''[[Sinclair User]]'' said "It's not that this computer moderated game is a particularly dire example of the various footballing games going the rounds, but it's very expensive, irritatingly fiddly (with its cards and counters), impossibly to play on your own and definitely not championship material."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Sinclair_User_060/page/56/mode/2up|title=Sinclair User 060|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Richard Bellis for ''[[Acorn User]]'' said "Overall, ''Brian Clough's Football Fortunes'' is a game that is fun to play, with clear instructions, in a smart box. It leaves the fun bits to you and does the tedious bits itself."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AcornUser058-May87|title=AcornUser058-May87/page/n141/mode/2up|date=May 19, 1987|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

''[[Computer Gamer]]'' said "Even if you already own one of the many other simulations, this game has many differing challenges through its revolutionary presentation. A great game which could so easily have been unbeatable."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_24_1987-03_Argus_Press_GB/page/n89/mode/2up|title=Computer Gamer - Issue 24 (1987-03)(Argus Press)(GB)|date=March 6, 1987|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
