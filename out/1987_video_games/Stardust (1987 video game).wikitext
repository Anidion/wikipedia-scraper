== Gameplay ==
The player controls a small space ship called an "Astrohunter", which flies over the surface of a series of large enemy supercruisers on their way to attack Earth. The player must avoid or destroy various ground targets and free-flying drones in order to eventually reach an array of shield generators. The ship is equipped with a gun that can be improved by collecting [[power-up]]s, and a second weapon that targets objects on the ground.

When all the supercruisers have been passed, the Astrohunter lands in an enemy starship and its pilot continues on foot to reach the shield generators. After destroying the generators the pilot must be returned to the ship to escape.
