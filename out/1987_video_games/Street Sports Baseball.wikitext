==Reception==
Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Street Sports Baseball is more reminiscent than whimsical, but it is no less fun. Remember the sandlot games where home plate was a garbage can lid and old tree stumps were just part of the hazards of outfield duty? Well, all that and more comes alive in this excellent program."<ref name="CGW40">{{cite magazine |last=Teverbaugh |first=Rick |title=Sports Scoreboard |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1987 |volume=1 |issue=40 |pages=44}}</ref>
