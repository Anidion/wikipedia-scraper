==Gameplay==
[[File:Grand_Prix_Simulator_Atari_8-bit_PAL_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Atari 8-bit screenshot]]
The game is designed so that the player is looking down on the track from an overhead view, similar to arcade games such as ''[[Badlands (video game)|Badlands]]'' or ''[[Super Off Road]]''. The player controls one car on the track, while the computer controls the other. Each race is three laps around the track. If the player wins a race, they progress to the next track. The game is over when the player loses a race or crashes.

Points are earned for winning a race and extra points are given for picking up bonus items that appear on the track. Oil spots can also appear on the track that, if driven over, cause the player's car to spin, losing time.

The game can also be played competitively by two players.
