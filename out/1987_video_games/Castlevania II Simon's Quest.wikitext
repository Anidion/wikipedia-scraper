==Gameplay==
[[File:Castlevania II Simon's Quest screenshot.png|thumb|left|The player-character Simon can buy items and talk to villagers for clues.]]
Gameplay in ''Castlevania II: Simon's Quest'' departs from the platforming genre of the first ''Castlevania'', and introduces [[nonlinear gameplay]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements inspired by ''[[The Maze of Galious]]'' (1987), including a [[Overworld|world map]] which the player is free to explore and revisit.<ref name="AkamatsuDevCommentary"/><ref name="1UP-Parish">Jeremy Parish, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110629034651/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=7212636 Metroidvania Chronicles II: Simon's Quest][[1UP.com]], June 28, 2006</ref><ref name="Simon1"/><ref name="Simon4">{{cite book| title=Castlevania II: Simon's Quest instruction manual| year=1988| publisher=Konami| id=NES-QU-USA | pages=8–9}}</ref> [[Simon Belmont|Simon]], controlled by the player, can talk with villagers who will offer him clues or lies.<ref name="Simon1">{{cite book| title=Castlevania II: Simon's Quest instruction manual| year=1988| publisher=Konami| id=NES-QU-USA | pages=4–5}}</ref> He can go to merchants who sell items, either for fighting enemies or for traversing to otherwise unreachable areas.

The period of time in ''Simon's Quest'' cycles between daytime and nightfall,<ref name="Simon2"/> which has an effect on the game and Simon's encounters. During the day, the enemies outside villages are weaker. At nighttime, they gain strength and inflict more damage to Simon's life points;<ref name="Simon2"/> though when defeated, they drop more hearts.<ref name="Simon1"/><ref name="Simon3"/> The villagers and merchants in their respective locations are also no longer available to talk to and are replaced by zombies.<ref name="Simon2"/><ref name="Simon5">{{cite book| title=Castlevania II: Simon's Quest instruction manual| year=1988| publisher=Konami| id=NES-QU-USA | pages=12}}</ref>

The objective of the game is to travel to the five mansions to find the five body parts of Dracula's corpse, and the Magic Cross.<ref name="Simon1"/> The body parts can be utilized to support Simon in the game. For example, Dracula's Rib can be used as a shield to block projectile attacks fired from an enemy.<ref name="Simon4"/><ref name="CV2History">{{cite web |url=http://gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/history_castlevania/p4_01.html |title=The History of Castlevania – Castlevania II: Simon's Quest |website=[[GameSpot]] |author=Mike Whalen, Giancarlo Varanini |access-date=2008-08-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725014047/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/history_castlevania/p4_01.html |archive-date=2008-07-25 }}</ref> Finding all of the required items will allow Simon to clear the blockade in front of Dracula's castle to fight the [[Boss (video games)|last boss]].<ref name="Simon1"/>

==Plot==
The game takes place seven years after the original ''Castlevania''.<ref name="Simon6"/> The prologue begins when Simon visits his family's resting place.<ref name="Simon6"/> He encounters a young woman at the cemetery who tells him a curse was placed on him by Dracula during their last battle, and that Simon does not have long to live. The woman says the curse can be undone if he resurrects Dracula himself, explaining that Dracula's body was split into five parts after his defeat, and that Simon must find and bring them to the ruins of Dracula's castle.<ref name="Simon7"/> There, he must seal and defeat Dracula. The woman adds it is not guaranteed this will be Dracula's end.<ref name="Simon7"/>
	
After Simon defeats Dracula, there are three possible endings depending on the time the player takes to complete the game.<ref name="CV2History"/> In two, Simon sustains fatal injuries from the confrontation with Dracula and dies. The best ending is achieved when the player beats the game in eight game days.<ref name="Endings">{{Cite web |url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/games/cv2end.html |title=Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest |publisher=ClassicGaming.com.

==Development and release==
''Simon's Quest'' was designed by Hitoshi Akamatsu, who also directed ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'' (1986) and ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'' (1989) on the NES.<ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]] |developer=[[Konami|Konami Industry Co., Ltd.]] |publisher=Konami Industry Co., Ltd. |language=ja |date=22 December 1989 |scene=staff credits (second playthrough)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,100574/|title=Hitoshi Akamatsu Video Game Credits and Biography|publisher=MobyGames|access-date=2016-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312125542/http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,100574/|archive-date=2017-03-12|url-status=live}}</ref> It was released on the [[Famicom Disk System]] (FDS) on August 28, 1987 in Japan.<ref name="FamicomDate"/> Originally titled ''Dracula II'' in Japan, Akamatsu created the title ''Simon's Quest'' for release in Western territories.<ref name="AkamatsuDevCommentary">{{Cite web |url=http://shmuplations.com/castlevania/ |title=Castlevania – Developer Commentary |publisher=Shmupulations |access-date=2019-05-10 |archive-date=2019-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510125131/https://shmuplations.com/castlevania/ |url-status=live }}</ref> When asked if ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' (1986) had any influence on the development of the game, Akamatsu instead cited ''[[The Maze of Galious]]'' (1987), another [[platform-adventure game]] by Konami that features puzzle solving and a [[Overworld|world map]].<ref name="AkamatsuDevCommentary"/>
Most of the original artwork for ''Simon's Quest'' and other early ''Castlevania'' games was lost during the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] of 1995.<ref name="IGNCVRetro"/>

''Simon's Quest'' was converted to cartridge for release on the NES in North America on December 1988, and in Europe on April 27, 1990. There are functional differences due to hardware differences between the FDS and cartridge.<ref name="Cv2Diff">{{Cite web |url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/games/cv2foreign.html |title=Castlevania II: Simon's Quest |publisher=ClassicGaming.com. [[GameSpy]] |access-date=2008-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314142917/http://castlevaniadungeon.net/games/cv2foreign.html |archive-date=2016-03-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> The FDS version features a progress [[Saved game|saving feature]], commonly seen on FDS games due to the rewritable floppy disk. The NES version instead uses a [[Password (video games)|password function]] to save player progress.<ref name="Cv2Diff"/> The FDS medium has a [[Data (computer science)|data]] storage limitation of {{nowrap|112 [[kilobyte]]s}} of slow access, whereas bank-switching techniques and solid memory costs allow cartridges to have comparable data space with much faster access. The developers used the additional space to improve the music quality of the NES version, adding percussion samples and re-arranging the melodies to take advantage of the technology.<ref name="Cv2Diff"/> Other changes were made to correct several grammatical and spelling errors in the translation, although the rendering of the protagonist's name as "Simmon Belmont" in the game's endings stayed.<ref name="Cv2Diff"/> 

''Simon's Quest'' has seen several re-releases. On November 16, 2002, the game was included on ''Konami Collector's Series: Castlevania & Contra'' in North America, a [[Personal computer|PC]] collection of the Konami NES games via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]].<ref name="CastlevaniaAndContra">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/konamicollectorsscc/similar.html?mode=versions|title=Konami Collector's Series: Castlevania & Contra&nbsp;— Release Summary|website=[[GameSpot]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525065930/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/konamicollectorsscc/similar.html?mode=versions|archive-date=2011-05-25|url-status=dead|access-date=2007-10-11}}</ref> It has been re-released on other consoles through Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] service.<ref name=ReleaseSummary2>{{cite web |url=http://gamespot.com/wii/action/castlevaniaiisimonsquest/similar.html?mode=versions |title=Castlevania II: Simon's Quest – Release Summary (Wii) |website=[[GameSpot]] |access-date=2008-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> ''Simon's Quest'' is included in the North American and European versions of the [[NES Classic Edition]], a miniature replica of the NES featuring many built-in games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3095790/hardware/nintendos-releasing-a-miniature-nes-console-packed-with-30-classic-games.html|title=Nintendo's releasing a miniature NES console packed with 30 classic games|last1=Paul|first1=Ian|date=July 14, 2016|access-date=July 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715075807/http://www.pcworld.com/article/3095790/hardware/nintendos-releasing-a-miniature-nes-console-packed-with-30-classic-games.html|archive-date=July 15, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is also a part of the multi-platform ''[[Castlevania Anniversary Collection]]'', a 2019 compilation of past ''Castlevania'' titles, and ''Simon's Quest'' has the distinction of being the only game in the collection that was released in Japan using the North American version instead of its Japanese counterpart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nintendoeverything.com/castlevania-anniversary-collection-screenshots-price-point/ |title=Castlevania Anniversary Collection screenshots, price point |publisher=Nintendo Everything |date=2019-04-21 |access-date=2019-05-10 |archive-date=2019-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425145256/https://nintendoeverything.com/castlevania-anniversary-collection-screenshots-price-point/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/457/G045749/20190516035/|title=「悪魔城ドラキュラ アニバーサリーコレクション」が本日配信。山根ミチル氏インタビューや未公開資料を掲載した「ボーナスブック」を収録|website=4Gamer.net|access-date=2022-05-17|archive-date=2022-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220517173909/https://www.4gamer.net/games/457/G045749/20190516035/|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Active Gaming Media]] showed that the Japanese text was similarly misleading, but further described where and how an accurate hint from the Japanese game was lost.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.activegamingmedia.com/news/resolving-a-translation-mystery-castlevania-ii-simon%E2%80%99s-quest-sunday-ja |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310164141/http://www.activegamingmedia.com/news/resolving-a-translation-mystery-castlevania-ii-simon%E2%80%99s-quest-sunday-ja |archive-date=2011-03-10 |author=Anthony Teixeira |title=Resolving a Translation Mystery – Castlevania II |publisher=[[Active Gaming Media]] |access-date=2010-01-10}}</ref> Further criticism stemmed from some of the game's puzzles, which have no clues at all,<ref name=":1" /> such as a scenario where Simon must summon a tornado at Deborah Cliff with the Red Crystal.<ref name="GSReview"/> [[1UP.com]] said the game required a [[Strategy guide|walkthrough]] because of its non-explanatory nature.<ref name="1UPSQ">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3164033 |title=Retro Roundup 10/29: Castlevania, Spyro, Magician Lord |website=[[1UP.com]] |access-date=2008-08-09 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> ''[[Game Informer]]'' said that while the game is important in gaming history, it was still a polarizing game due to "cryptic puzzles" and other difficult elements.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Ranking The Castlevania Bloodline |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/04/ranking-the-castlevania-bloodline.aspx |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |last=Turi |first=Tim |date=2012-04-04 |access-date=2013-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507064948/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/04/ranking-the-castlevania-bloodline.aspx |archive-date=2013-05-07 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Legacy===
''Simon's Quest'' is the second ''Castlevania'' game to depart from linear gameplay, following ''[[Vampire Killer]]'' for the [[MSX2]] in 1986, and instead feature a non-linear explorative world. This design has been compared to Nintendo's ''Metroid'' series,<ref name="CV1up">{{cite web |author=Kurt Kalata |date=2006-07-26 |title=Tales from the Crypt: Castlevania's 20th Anniversary Blow-Out |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3152109 |work=1UP.com |access-date=2008-08-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522124136/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3152109 |archive-date=2011-05-22 }}</ref> yielding the [[Metroidvania]] subgenre. The game's exploration system and ideas introduced adventure elements to the series, and it would heavily influence future games.<ref name="IGNCVRetro">{{cite web |author=Mark Bozon |date=2007-01-18 |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/756/756724p2.html |title=Castlevania: The Retrospective |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=2008-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928192628/http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/756/756724p2.html |archive-date=2008-09-28 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first game that drew inspiration from it was ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''.<ref name="CV1up"/> Igarashi, ''Symphony of the Night''{{'}}s assistant director,  said the critical reaction to ''Simon's Quest'' and its gameplay allowed the game to be pitched to Konami.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.usgamer.net/articles/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night-wouldnt-have-happened-without-castlevania-2-simons-quest | title = Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Wouldn't Have Happened Without Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest | first = Nadia | last = Oxford | date = September 7, 2018 | access-date = September 7, 2018 | work = [[USGamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181001030938/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night-wouldnt-have-happened-without-castlevania-2-simons-quest | archive-date = October 1, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> ''Simon's Quest'' would be directly referenced in later ''Castlevania'' games.

In the game, the player must find them again.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance|developer=Konami |publisher=Konami|date=2002-06-06 |platform=Game Boy Advance|level=Corridor in the Air}}</ref>
