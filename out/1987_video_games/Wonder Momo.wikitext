{{nihongo foot|'''''Wonder Momo'''''|ワンダーモモ|Wandā Momo|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1987 [[beat 'em up]] [[arcade game]] that was developed and published by [[Namco]] exclusively in Japan. It was ported to the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC-Engine]] in 1989, with both versions of the game later ported to the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]], and ported to [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]] as part of [[Arcade Archives]]. The game was also included in ''[[Namco Museum]] Encore'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. ''Wonder Momo'' inspired a [[webcomic]] series in 2012, an [[anime]] miniseries in 2014, and a sequel game by [[WayForward|WayForward Technologies]] in May 2014.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Wndrmomo.png|left|thumb|Screenshot of ''Wonder Momo'' (arcade version)]]

''Wonder Momo'' is a loose parody of a typical ''[[Ultra Series|Ultraman]]''-style [[superhero]] series, and utilizing a then-rare female protagonist. When the game is first started, players are treated to a parody of the [[MGM]] logo featuring Momo instead of a lion and a "Modoki" instead of a mask. The game then cuts to a scene of a theater stage, where a play begins starring Momo, a young woman who gets [[Superpower (ability)|super-power]]s. At this point the game puts the player in command of Momo. Rather than playing a hero who needs to save the world, the setting is that of a live stage show (set at the "Namco Theater"), and the player is actually controlling an actress who is merely playing the ''role'' of Momo/Wonder Momo. The game also features voice samples in Japanese.

As Momo, she can only attack using kicks, and in doing so builds up her "Wonder" meter. When she touches a tornado icon, or spins around by herself, she can turn into ''Wonder Momo'' and can also attack using the ''Wonder Hoop'', which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she will not be able to throw anymore, while she will have to wait for it to bounce back to her. She can also shoot small waves of energy in whichever direction she faces (while she is crouching), which is based on the similar move by the ''Ultraman'' characters. Her most powerful attack is the ''Wonder Typhoon'' - a more powerful version of her small energy wave attack which shoots numerous small energy waves towards the left and right sides of the screen simultaneously, while she is spinning.

The game is notable for featuring some slightly risqué content for the time, in the form of [[fanservice]] (at Momo's expense). When Momo jumps, the player can visibly see her underwear. Momo also needs to be wary of photographers in the theatre audience, who are determined to get a peek under her miniskirt. If one is successful, Momo will be "embarrassed" (stunned) for a short period of time. Additionally, one of the images that appears on the theater curtain (at the beginning and end of some acts) is Momo wearing only a towel.

The titular character made numerous appearances outside of her video game, mostly in Namco's other video games. Wonder Momo appeared as one of the playable characters in the Japan-only, tactical RPG title ''[[Namco x Capcom]]'', partnering with [[Bravoman]], while Amazona appeared as an enemy character. Momo often covered herself, alluding to the original game. Some artifacts, models and costumes based on Wonder Momo appeared in some other Namco titles. She appeared as a magnus card in the Namco RPG ''[[Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean]]'', made a cameo appearance as one of Anise's dolls in ''[[Tales of the Abyss]]'', had her normal self appear as one of the various floats that appear in the bonus stages of ''[[Marvel Land]]'', and had her "Wonder" costume appear in ''[[Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 2]]'' and in Catalogue 4 in the [[Xbox 360]] game ''[[The Idolmaster]]''. Her latest appearance lies in the PSP strategy RPG ''[[Queen's Gate: Spiral Chaos]]''. A theme based on ''Wonder Momo'', with the game's characters is featured in ''[[Pac-Man 99]]'', as special DLC.

==In other media==
''Wonder Momo'' received a brief adaptation as part of the manga anthology {{nihongo|'''''Famitsu Comix: The Shape of Happiness'''''|しあわせのかたち|Shiawase no katachi}}, published in the Famitsu Comics collection from March 1989, drawn by Tamakichi Sakura.

Besides appearing in video games, [[J-pop]] singer [[Haruko Momoi]] released an album influenced by the video game fully titled as ''[[WONDER MOMO-i〜New recording〜]]'' (a pun combining her last name with the name of this game). It utilizes both the game's main gameplay theme and the "henshin" (transformation) theme. Yujin released a [[gashapon]] figure of Momo as part of the "Namco Girls" collection.

===ShiftyLook comic===
On March 15, 2012, Wonder Momo was resurrected as an internet comic strip on Namco Bandai's comic strip website [[ShiftyLook]] with the title ''Wonder Momo: Battle Idol''. The series, illustrated by Omar Dogan and written by Erik Ko and Jim Zub, is set 25 years after the original game and focuses on Momoko, an idol who, after failing a TV show audition, encounters a race of aliens who give her Wonder Momo's powers. Learning to harness them, she begins battling evil aliens as well as rival hero Amazona, who is actually a popular idol named Akiho Mazo who was inspired by the original Wonder Momo, later revealed to be Momoko's mother. Wonder Momo also made several appearances in Shiftylook's concurrent ''[[Bravoman]]'' webcomic and webseries, voiced by [[Romi Dames]] in the latter. The comic concluded with its 200th page on March 14, 2014, following the announcement of ShiftyLook's closure.

On January 28, 2014, [[Bandai Namco Games]] announced a ''Wonder Momo'' anime miniseries, based on the story from the 2012 ShiftyLook webcomic.
