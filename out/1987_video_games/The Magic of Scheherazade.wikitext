'''''The Magic of Scheherazade'''''{{efn|Known as {{nihongo|''Arabian Dream Scheherazade''|アラビアンドリーム シェラザード|Arabian Dorimu Sherazado}} in Japan.}} is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]]/[[role-playing video game]] (RPG) developed and released by [[Culture Brain]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). The game was released in 1987 in Japan and 1990 in North America. The plot is based on [[Middle East]]ern folktales found in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. It involves an [[amnesia|amnesic]] hero traveling through time in an attempt to rescue the princess [[Scheherazade]] from the evil wizard Sabaron, who has summoned a horde of demons to bring chaos to the once peaceful land of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. ''The Magic of Scheherazade'' is divided into chapters and incorporates elements of both action-adventure and RPG gameplay styles. In each chapter, the [[player character]] can freely explore an [[overworld]] in a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]]. The player engages hostile enemies with various weapons and spells through both [[Real-time game|real-time]] solo action on the overhead map and random, [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games|turn-based]] battles fought alongside befriended allies.

Once the commercial viability of the NES was proven in North America by the late 1980s, Japanese developer Culture Brain opened a company branch in the United States and chose to publish an English-language version of ''The Magic of Scheherazade'' after making several changes to the graphics and musical score. It has received mostly average review scores but generally positive commentary from critics for its visuals, gameplay, and difficulty balance. The game has been noted for its fusion of the adventure and RPG genres, though journalists have referred to its gameplay mechanics as lower-quality versions of what was seen in both ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' and the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Magic of Scheherazade - Water World Mooroon.png|left|frame|The player battles enemies in the overworld. The [[character class]], [[Experience point|experience level]], and other statistics are displayed at the bottom.]]<!-- FAIR USE of Magic_of_Scheherazade_-_Water_World_Mooroon.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magic_of_Scheherazade_-_Water_World_Mooroon.png for rationale -->
''The Magic of Scheherazade'' combines gameplay elements from [[action-adventure game]]s and [[role-playing video game|RPGs]]. In the game, the player must travel through a series of worlds and defeat the evil wizard Sabaron, rescue Scheherazade, and bring peace back to Arabia. The game consists of five chapters; the first four chapters involve the player's journey through four worlds in which they must find the palace and defeat the demon that resides there. The fifth chapter involves the final battle with Sabaron.<ref name="manualstart">{{cite book | editor=Culture Brain staff | date=January 15, 1990 | title=The Magic of Scheherazade ''Instruction Manual'' | publisher=[[Culture Brain|Culture Brain USA, Inc.]] | id=NES–AS–USA | pages=6–7}}</ref> Players may start a new game or resume the game with a [[Password (video gaming)|password]]. If a new game is started, the player must choose between three classes – Fighter, Magician, or Saint. Each class differs in weapon usage and certain abilities. For instance, a Fighter can use strong swords but is limited with the rod, a Magician is adept at using powerful rods but is restricted to a weak dagger instead of swords, and a Saint can exclusively utilize items like boots that prevent damage on hazardous floors.<ref name="manualclasspassword">{{cite book | editor=Culture Brain staff | date=January 15, 1990 | title=The Magic of Scheherazade ''Instruction Manual'' | publisher=[[Culture Brain|Culture Brain USA, Inc.]] | id=NES–AS–USA | pages=8–11}}</ref><ref name="hcg"/> Weapons, spells, items, and actions like speaking or jumping can be mapped to the [[gamepad]]'s "A" or "B" buttons on a select subscreen. A [[Head-up display (video gaming)|status bar]] displays the player character's selected actions, [[character class]], [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]], coins, and some expendable supplies.<ref name="manualaction">{{cite book | editor=Culture Brain staff | date=January 15, 1990 | title=The Magic of Scheherazade ''Instruction Manual'' | publisher=[[Culture Brain|Culture Brain USA, Inc.]] | id=NES–AS–USA | pages=12–19}}</ref>

The majority of play takes place on an [[video game graphics#Top-down perspective|overhead map]] where the player can freely move between separate screens; the [[overworld]] comprises numerous landscapes and locales including forests, deserts, towns, underwater areas, dimly-lit dungeons, and palace labyrinths. The player will also find "Time Gates" that allow for time travel between the past, present, and future; they transport the player to the same location but in a different time and environment.<ref name="hcg"/><ref name="manualstory"/> In the towns, the player can interact with [[Non-player character|NPCs]] to gather information and initiate quests, gather new party members, purchase supplies as shops, replenish party members' [[hit point]]s (HP) and [[Magic (gaming)|magic points]] (MP) at hotels, gamble money at [[casino]]s, and change character class or save their progress via passwords at mosques.<ref name="hcg"/><ref name="vgce"/><ref name="manualtowns">{{cite book | editor=Culture Brain staff | date=January 15, 1990 | title=The Magic of Scheherazade ''Instruction Manual'' | publisher=[[Culture Brain|Culture Brain USA, Inc.]] | id=NES–AS–USA | pages=40–41}}</ref>

In the overworld, enemies will often [[Random encounter|randomly appear]] and are fought in [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real time]]. The player can use a sword for close-range attacks, a rod for shooting long-range projectiles, and magic spells. Slaying enemies earns the player [[experience point]]s that go towards increasing overall experience levels. Reaching higher levels improves the player's maximum attributes (HP and MP) and can sometimes enhance weapon strength or yield new magic spells.<ref name="manualaction"/> When transitioning between screens on the overhead map, the player will sometimes encounter random, [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games|turn-based]] battles with groups of enemies.<ref name="hcg"/><ref name="manualcommand">{{cite book | editor=Culture Brain staff | date=January 15, 1990 | title=The Magic of Scheherazade ''Instruction Manual'' | publisher=[[Culture Brain|Culture Brain USA, Inc.]] | id=NES–AS–USA | pages=21–26}}</ref> The start of each battle gives the player the option to fight, escape, or attempt to bribe enemies into leaving. Fighting alone or with up to two allies, the player takes turns trading blows with enemy units by picking commands such as striking with equipped weapons or casting magic. Formations (learned for a fee at "Magic Universities" in certain towns) can also be created, which can grant the party added defense or enable them to cast powerful group magic spells; certain formations work particularly well against certain "squads" or "regiments". Finally, mercenary troopers, which can be hired in towns, can be used to aid the party in attacks.<ref name="hcg"/><ref name="manualcommand"/>

==Plot==
The [[fantasy]] setting of ''The Magic of Scheherazade'' borrows from [[Middle East]]ern folk tales in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.<ref name="gameplayers">{{cite magazine | author=[[William R.

A magician named Isfa, harnessing the power of the blue star Airosche, vanquished the demons and sealed them underground. Peace briefly returned until the evil wizard Sabaron freed Goragora and the demons from their captivity and imprisoned the Arabian princess [[Scheherazade]] and her family.<ref name="manualstory">{{cite book | editor=Culture Brain staff | date=January 15, 1990 | title=The Magic of Scheherazade ''Instruction Manual'' | publisher=[[Culture Brain|Culture Brain USA, Inc.]] | id=NES–AS–USA | pages=4–7}}</ref>

The [[player character]] takes on the role of Isfa's unnamed descendant, who unsuccessfully attempts to save his lover Scheherazade from Sabaron. As a result, the player's memories are erased, his magical powers are sealed, and he is thrust into a different time period.<ref name="destructoid">{{cite web | author=Bennett, Colette | date=February 27, 2009 | title=An RPG Draws Near!

The hero then goes to the Dark World and destroys Goragora, returning tranquility to Arabia once again. After being thanked by Scheherazade and her family, the hero promises to return to his beloved someday as he and his party depart on a [[magic carpet]] toward their next adventure.

==Development and release==
''The Magic of Scheherazade'' was developed for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (Famicom in Japan) by [[Culture Brain]]. A person working under the pseudonym "Akademiya Yumenosuke" was the game's [[game producer|producer]], according to a ''[[Famitsu|Weekly Famitsu]]'' interview.<ref name="famitsu261"/> Composers Akinori Sawa and Shunichi Mikame worked as its [[Video game music#Composers|composers]].<ref name="sawa"/><ref name="mikame"/> Sawa worked primarily on Culture Brain's ''[[Hiryū no Ken]]'' series.<ref name="sawa"/> Mikame had previously composed the scores for both ''[[Kung Fu Heroes]]'' and ''[[Flying Dragon: The Secret Scroll]]''.<ref name="mikame"/> His musical equipment consisted of two [[Polyphony and monophony in instruments#Synthesizer|polyphonic synthesizers]], a [[Frequency modulation synthesis|frequency modulation synthesizer]], and a [[Music sequencer|hardware sequencer]]. Compositions were recorded to [[Cassette tape|audio cassette]] and then simplified to the Famicom's [[programmable sound generator]], once approved by the producer. Only three of the six songs Mikame composed were used in game, and he left the company before its Japanese release.<ref name="mikame"/>

''The Magic of Scheherazade'' received mixed reviews at release. Opinions of the game's graphics and musical score have been mostly positive. Both [[William R. Trotter]] of ''[[Game Players]]'' and Rusel DeMaria of ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'' commended the game's visuals but DeMaria simply characterized the music and sound as "fine".<ref name="vgce"/><ref name="gameplayers"/> Trotter was specifically impressed with the magic spell effects, characters sprites, and environments.<ref name="gameplayers"/> ''Game Players'' awarded the game "Best Graphics" for console titles first previewed in the US in 1989.<ref name="gpawards"/> Contrarily, reviewers from a 1990 ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' panel discounted the game's presentation as either average or not up to the standards of the game's contemporaries.<ref name="egmrev"/>

The gameplay and challenge were also high points for many reviewers. Trotter applauded the amount of content and compared the time-consuming yet intuitive learning curve for the game's mechanics to the ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' series. He said: "Everything is clearly organized, so what at first seems unwieldy soon becomes natural and logical".<ref name="gameplayers"/> DeMaria found the game easy yet satisfying, summarizing that it might offer fun for new and intermediate players while experience players could still find "enough plot twists and interesting challenges to make the game fun to play".<ref name="vgce"/> ''GamePro'' likewise recommended the game to beginner, intermediate, and advanced players alike.<ref name="gameproreview"/> ''EGM'' found the game as an overall mediocre diversion to other RPGs of its time, but similarly acknowledged the gameplay as being "nicely handled" and "easy to catch on to". One of the magazine's writers, Ed Semrad, appreciated its challenge level and referred to it as the next "decent quest game" following ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]''.<ref name="egmrev"/>

Critics have addressed the game's similarities to other action-adventure titles and turn-based RPGs, as well as its blending of the two genres. Several compared the game's top-down adventure aesthetic and interface to ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''.<ref name="hcg"/><ref name="vgce"/><ref name="destructoid"/> DeMaria recognized the two games' resemblance, but noted ''The Magic of Scheherazade'' as being much more [[Nonlinear gameplay|linear]].<ref name="vgce"/> ''Hardcore Gaming 101''{{'}}s Michael Ayala contrasted the time travel aspect with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'' and its turn-based battles with those of ''[[Dragon Quest]]''. However, he admitted both features felt unpolished in ''The Magic of Scheherazade'' but proclaimed the soundtrack as "excellent" aside from one "incredibly grating" theme heard in rare instances in battle.<ref name="hcg"/> ''[[Destructoid]]'' contributor Colette Bennett praised the music and found the [[Middle East]]-inspired setting unique amid [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-themed RPGs of its release period.<ref name="destructoid"/> Andrew Vestal of ''[[GameSpot]]'' comically described the game as a result of two development groups feuding over whether to create an action RPG or a turn-based RPG. He credited the game as being one of the first RPGs to introduce team attacks, in which two party members could join forces to perform extra-powerful magic.<ref name="gamespot">{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Vestal|title=The History of Console RPGs|page=Other NES RPGs|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 11, 1998|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/nes5.html|access-date=March 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211075622/http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/nes5.html|archive-date=December 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Video game journalist and ''[[Retronauts]]'' writer Jeremy Parish vaguely described the game in 2017 as "innovative and memorable", even declaring it to be Culture Brain's "crown jewel" when mentioning its conspicuous absence from Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] service.<ref>{{cite web | author=Parish, Jeremy | date=January 26, 2017 | title=Virtual Console (Culture) Brain dump | url=https://retronauts.com/article/238/virtual-console-culture-brain-dump | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408110453/https://retronauts.com/article/238/virtual-console-culture-brain-dump | publisher=[[Eurogamer]] | work=[[1UP Shows and Podcasts#Retronauts|Retronauts]] | archive-date=April 8, 2019 | access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>
