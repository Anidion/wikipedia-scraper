'''''Earl Weaver Baseball''''' is a [[baseball]] [[video game]] (1987) designed by [[Don Daglow]] and [[Eddie Dombrower]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The [[artificial intelligence]] for the computer manager was provided by [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] member [[Earl Weaver]], then manager of the [[Baltimore Orioles]], based on a lengthy series of interviews.<ref name="theathletic-2020">{{cite news |last1=Law |first1=Keith |title=Like its namesake, Earl Weaver Baseball was way ahead of its time |url=https://theathletic.com/1708634/2020/04/02/like-its-namesake-earl-weaver-baseball-was-way-ahead-of-its-time/ |access-date=September 22, 2023 |work=The Athletic |date=April 2, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> ''EWB'' was a major hit, and along with ''[[John Madden Football (1988 video game)|John Madden Football]]'' helped pave the way for the [[EA Sports]] brand, which launched in 1992.

== Innovations ==

''Earl Weaver Baseball'' is remembered for introducing many innovations to the computer sports game industry. It was the first commercial computer sports game to allow players to simulate an entire season of games without actually showing each game play-by-play on the screen. The Amiga version featured voice synthesis, a first in a sports computer game. Unlike baseball games released since, names were represented [[Phonemic orthography|phonetically]], so that even custom-created players could be announced by the synthesized voice. For the first time, different stadiums were shown graphically on the screen, with gameplay adjusted for their actual dimensions. Defunct or demolished stadiums were included, such as the [[Polo Grounds]] (New York), [[Griffith Stadium]] (Washington, D.C.), [[Ebbets Field]] (Brooklyn, New York), and [[Sportsman's Park]] (St. Louis).<ref name="mlb-2013">{{cite news |last1=Wohl |first1=Dan |title=After Earl Weaver's passing, let's remember the innovative computer game that bore his name |url=https://www.mlb.com/cut4/after-earl-weavers-passing-lets-remember-the-innovative-computer-game-that-bore-his-name/c-41038076 |access-date=September 22, 2023 |work=MLB.com |date=January 19, 2013 |language=en}}</ref>

== ''Earl Weaver Baseball II'' ==
{{Main|Earl Weaver Baseball II}}
'''''Earl Weaver Baseball II (EWB2)''''' was the sequel to the classic game, and featured many advances, including the first full 3D camera that would render a television-style viewing experience. However, the game was released prematurely by Electronic Arts, and it suffered from quality and performance problems.<ref name="theathletic-2020" />

== ''I Got It Baseball'' ==

In 2002, Dombrower released a version of ''EWB2'' called ''I Got It Baseball'' as [[shareware]], though in this version, the gamer can only manage, not participate. However, the managerial AI still remains, though now called "The Skipper".  Also intact are the physics engine, the player AI, the fully developed team, player, and ballpark editors; stat accumulation, and a now-commonplace "QuickPlay" option. It can be downloaded at his website.<ref>[http://www.bangbangplay.com BangBangPlay.com], location of ''I Got It Baseball''</ref>
