{{nihongo|'''''Blazer'''''|ブレイザー|Bureizā}} is an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] [[arcade game]] released by [[Namco]] in 1987 only in [[Japan]]; it runs on the company's [[Namco System 1|System 1 hardware]], and used a three-quarter-view perspective (another one of them is Namco's own ''[[Pac-Mania]]'').

==Gameplay==
The player must alternate between a [[tank]] named "Vanguard" and a [[helicopter]] named "Hardy" (and in the tenth and final mission, a [[hovercraft]] named "Atlanta"), to kill enemies both on land and in the air. Some air-based enemies will leave behind powerups for Vanguard to collect, when hit by its anti-aircraft [[missile]]s; they can restore its [[fuel]], increase its fuel capacity, make it invulnerable for a short period of time, and even grant it an extra life if it manages to collect enough of them (which is initially thirteen, but it can go up to sixteen).

This game was dedicated to Shoko Tamako Sumie from all its staff;<ref>http://www.vazcomics.org/mamend/B/blazer.htm Blazer at MamEnd</ref> upon completion of the game, it gives a list of schematics for the player tank, and a passage from ''In The Cold Morning Of August''.
