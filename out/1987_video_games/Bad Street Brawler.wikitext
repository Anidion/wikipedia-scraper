==Gameplay==

The player plays the character Duke Davis (the back of the box calls him Duke Dunnegan), who goes from stage to stage beating up gangsters that get in his way, dressed in a yellow [[Tank top (shirt)|tank top]], [[sunglasses]], and yellow pants. He is described as a former [[punk rock]]er and the "world's coolest" [[martial artist]].

Before the start of the next stage, quotes are introduced to entertain the player (such as "Never trouble trouble until trouble troubles you"). The player fights a variety of enemies, such as [[gorilla]]s and circus [[Dwarfism|dwarves]] who throw [[hammer throw|hammers]] at the player (old ladies in the computer versions who throw purses at the player). There are 15 stages in this game. Moves include the "bull ram" attack and "trip" move.
