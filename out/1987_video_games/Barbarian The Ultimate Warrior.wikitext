'''''Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior''''' is a 1987 [[video game]] developed and published by [[Palace Software]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. The game was ported to many other systems and was licensed to [[Epyx]] who published it as '''''Death Sword''''' in the United States.

''Barbarian'' is a [[fighting game]] that gives players control over sword-wielding [[barbarians]]. In the game's two-player mode, players pit their characters against each other. ''Barbarian'' also has a single-player mode, in which the player's barbarian braves a series of challenges set by an evil wizard to rescue a princess.

Instead of using painted artwork for the game's box, Palace Software used photos of hired models. The photos, also used in advertising campaigns, featured [[Michael Van Wijk]] (who would later become famous as 'Wolf' in the TV series ''[[Gladiators (1992 British TV series)|Gladiators]]'') as the hero and bikini-clad [[Maria Whittaker]], a model who was then associated with ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' tabloid's [[Page 3]] topless photo shoots. Palace Software's marketing strategy provoked controversy in the United Kingdom, with protests focused on the sexual aspects of the packaging rather than decapitations and other violence within the game. The ensuing controversy boosted ''Barbarian''{{'}}s profile, helping to make it a commercial success. Game critics were impressed with its fast and furious combat, and dashes of humour. The game was Palace Software's critical hit; boosted by ''Barbarian''{{'}}s success, Palace Software expanded its operations and started publishing other developers' work. In 1988, the company released a sequel, ''[[Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax]]''.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Barbarian (Palace Software) - Gameplay.png|frame|left|alt=On the left and right of the screen stands a pillar entwined with a different-colored snake and two pairs of skulls. Above them, in the top corners, are circles that represent the life points of the barbarian fighters. A banner, emblazoned with the word "Barbarian", lies in the top centre. The players' scores are displayed below the word. The lower centre of the screen depicts a stone-walled room with two high windows. A bald man in purple robes stands in the window on the left. A black-haired busty woman in a red bikini stands in the right. In the room are two loincloth-wearing men who are fighting each other with swords. The left man has chopped off the right man's head.|''Barbarian'' features gory combat for the sake of rescuing a bikini-wearing princess.]]
''Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior'' is a [[fighting game]] that supports one or two players. Players assume the roles of sword-wielding barbarians, who battle in locales such as a forest glade and a "fighting pit".<ref name=cvg79>{{cite journal

== Development ==
In 1985, [[Palace Software]] hired Steve Brown as a game designer and artist. He thought up the concept of pitting a broom-flying witch against a monster pumpkin, and created ''[[Cauldron (video game)|Cauldron]]'' and ''[[Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back]]''. The two games were commercial successes and Brown was given free rein for his third work. He was inspired by [[Frank Frazetta]]'s fantasy paintings to create a sword fighting game that was "brutal and as realistic as possible".<ref name=retro23>{{cite magazine | last = Carroll | first = Martyn | date = 30 March 2006 | title = Company Profile: Palace Software | magazine = Retro Gamer | issue = 23 | pages = 66–69 | publisher = Imagine Publishing | location = Bournemouth, United Kingdom | issn = 1742-3155 }}</ref>

Brown based the game and its characters on the ''[[Conan (books)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' series, having read all of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s stories of the eponymous warrior.<ref>{{cite journal

One move, the Web of Death, was copied from the 1984 [[sword and sorcery]] film ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''. Spinning the sword like a propeller, Brown "nearly took [his] eye out" when he practised the move.<ref name=cu /><ref name=retro23 /> Playing back the videos, the team traced each frame of action onto clear plastic sheets laid over the television screen. The tracings were transferred on a grid that helped the team map the swordplay images, pixel by pixel, to a digital form.<ref name=cvg68a>{{cite journal

Feeling that most of the artwork on game boxes at that time were "pretty poor", Brown suggested that an "iconic fantasy imagery with real people would be a great hook for the publicity campaign."<ref name=retro23 /> His superiors agreed and arranged a photo shoot, hiring models [[Michael Van Wijk]] and [[Maria Whittaker]] to pose as the barbarian and princess.<ref>{{cite journal

After several discussions, Palace Software appended the subtitle "The Ultimate Warrior" to differentiate the two products.<ref>{{cite journal

The sounds of the characters are taken from the 1985 film ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]''. Most notably the "EEY-ECH!" sound that plays when the player attempts to decapitate an opponent. This particular sound can be found near the beginning of the movie when Arnold's character is ambushed after pulling an arrow out of the lady's back.<ref name=dazeland>{{cite web|title=Dazeland: Amiga Games|url=http://www.dazeland.com/Amiga_Games/Barbarian-Palace-English.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203536/http://www.dazeland.com/Amiga_Games/Barbarian-Palace-English.html|archive-date=2016-03-03}}</ref>

== Reception and legacy ==
''Barbarian''{{'}}s advertisements triggered some outcries of moral indignation. ''[[Electron User]]''  reported that another magazine had refused to publish [[Superior Software]]'s advert for its licensed BBC Micro and Acorn Electron ports unless parts of the image were covered up.<ref name='electronuserjuly88'>{{cite magazine |title=Advert eyeful|magazine=Electron User|volume=5 |issue=9 |publisher=Database |date=July 1988 |page=5}}</ref> ''Electron User'', who published the uncensored advertisement,<ref name='electronusersept88'>{{cite magazine |title=Barbarian starts a real life battle|magazine=Electron User|volume=5 |issue=12 |publisher=Database |date=September 1988 |page=6}}</ref> received letters from readers and religious bodies, who called the image "offensive and particularly insulting to women" and an "ugly pornographic advertisement".<ref name=retro23 /> Richard Hanson, Superior's managing director commented that the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] had confirmed that the image was not in bad taste,<ref name='electronusersept88' /> and that the publicity was likely to send the game to the top of the charts.<ref name='electronuserjuly88' />

Chris Jager, a writer for ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'', considered the cover "a trashy controversy-magnet featuring a glamour-saucepot" and a "big bloke [in leotard]".<ref>{{cite web  | last = Jager  | first = Chris  | title = The Hottest—and Most Hideous—Video Game Box Art Ever  | work = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]  | publisher = [[International Data Group|IDG]]  | date = 2009-02-28  | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/160321/the_hottest_and_most_hideous_video_game_box_art_ever.html

Video game industry observers Russell DeMaria and Johnny Wilson commented that the United Kingdom public were more concerned over the scantily-clad Whittaker than the gory contents in the game.<ref>{{cite book  | last1 = DeMaria  | first1 = Russell  | last2 = Wilson  | first2 = Johnny  | title = High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HJNvZLvpCEQC  | access-date = 2009-12-14  | edition = Second  | year = 2004  | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]]/Osborne  | location = California, United States   | isbn = 0-07-223172-6  | page = 356  | chapter = Across the Atlantic  | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HJNvZLvpCEQC&pg=PA320 }}</ref>

In 1988, ''[[ACE (magazine)|Advanced Computer Entertainment]]'' magazine submitted videos of the gameplay to the [[British Board of Film Classification]] who stated that the decapitations were merely "storybook violence" and that the game would have probably have received a PG certificate had it been submitted to them.<ref name='ace5arethesegamesillegal'>{{cite magazine |title=Are These Games Illegal?|magazine=ACE|issue=5|publisher=Future Publishing|date=February 1988|page=27|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=1731&page=28|access-date=28 January 2023}}</ref> David Houghton, writer for ''[[GamesRadar]]'', claimed the game would be rated "Mature" by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] if it was published in 2009.<ref>{{cite web

Reviewers were impressed with ''Barbarian''{{'}}s gory gameplay. ''Zzap!64''{{'}}s Steve Jarratt appreciated the "fast and furious" action and his colleague Ciaran Brennan said  ''Barbarian'' should have been the [[Highlander (video game)|licensed video game]] to the fantasy action film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' (which had a lot of sword fights and decapitations) instead.<ref name=zzap27 />  ''[[Amiga Computing]]''{{'}}s Brian Chappell enjoyed "hacking the foe to bits, especially when a well aimed blow decapitates him."<ref name=amicomp />  Several other reviewers express the same satisfaction in chopping the heads off their foes.<ref name=machine2 /><ref name=amicomp /> Although shocked at the game's violence, ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]''{{'}}s reviewer said the "sword fight game is the best available on the ST."<ref>{{cite journal
