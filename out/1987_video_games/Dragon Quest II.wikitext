'''''Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line''''',{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Dragon Quest II: Akuryō no Kamigami'''''|ドラゴンクエストII 悪霊の神々|lead=yes}}.}} titled '''''Dragon Warrior II''''' when initially localized to North America, is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Chunsoft]] and published by [[Enix]] in 1987 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] as a part of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series.  Enix's U.S. subsidiary published the American release, ''Dragon Warrior II'', for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990. ''Dragon Quest II'' is set one hundred years after the events of the [[Dragon Quest (video game)|first game]].

The game's story centers on the prince of Midenhall, who is ordered to stop an evil wizard named Hargon after Hargon destroys Moonbrooke Castle. On his adventure, he is accompanied by his two cousins, the prince of Cannock and the princess of Moonbrooke. ''Dragon Quest II'' expands on the first game by having a larger party, more areas to explore, multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, and a sailing ship. The game's successor, ''[[Dragon Quest III]]'', follows the ancestor of the main characters, the legendary hero [[Erdrick]]; and the three games are collectively called "Erdrick Saga Trilogy".

Planning began a month before the original ''Dragon Quest'' was released. One major goal was the development of a more exciting combat system, which was inspired by similar multi-character party systems such as the one found in ''[[Wizardry]]''. The artwork that was used as the basis for the characters and monsters was painted by [[Akira Toriyama]] and then translated into [[pixel art]]. The game was hit with delays due to game balance, which were only fully corrected in the early sections of the game. This, combined with a staff that included students not familiar with the coding and debugging process, pushed back the release by a month. The developers also had many ideas that had to be discarded due to the technical limitations of the Famicom system, though some were later incorporated into subsequent remakes and the game's sequel, ''Dragon Quest III''.

''Dragon Quest II'' was successful in Japan; the original Famicom version shipped over {{nowrap|2.4 million}} copies. Later, the game was remade for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] and the [[Game Boy Color]] and combined with the original ''Dragon Quest'' game in a release entitled ''Dragon Quest I & II''. A version of the game for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] was released in Japan on June 26, 2014, and worldwide on October 9, 2014, as ''Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line''.  The game was praised for improving on almost all aspects of the original, including having better graphics, having a larger world to explore, and more characters to participate in a more dynamic combat system.

''Dragon Quest II'' is known as one of the most difficult ''Dragon Quest'' games, especially in its late game, and retained that reputation even in later ports to other platforms that made the game somewhat more forgiving.

== Gameplay ==

[[File:Dragon Warrior II Image.png|thumb|left|The party wanders in a castle.]]

''Dragon Quest II'' is a [[role-playing video game]]. It allows the player to control more than one character, each of whom has their own characteristics,<ref name="gamespy" /> and it is the first game in the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series to do so.<ref name="np16_67">Editors of Nintendo Power: Nintendo Power September/October, 1990; issue 16 (in English). Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 67.</ref> The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party as was common in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members during the course of the game.<ref name="Iwata Asks: History">{{cite web|url=http://dqnine.com/#/iwata/|title=Dragon Quest: Sential of the Starry Skies|work=Iwata Asks|publisher=Square-Enix|at=The History of Dragon Quest|access-date=2010-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815052448/http://dqnine.com/#/iwata/|archive-date=2011-08-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> The player controls his or her characters as they move in the game world. They can search treasure chests, talk and trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells.

While wandering fields, towers, caves, seas, and dungeons, the player randomly encounters monsters, after which the game shifts to battle mode.<ref name="gamespy">{{cite web|title=The GameSpy Hall of Fame: Dragon Warrior|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/492/492001p2.html|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc.|archive-date=2012-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210145341/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/492/492001p2.html|access-date=22 June 2013|author=William Cassidy|date=2002-02-01}}</ref> The game's battle mode introduces groups of monsters, which is an upgrade from the one-on-one battles of ''[[Dragon Quest (video game)|Dragon Quest]]''.<ref name="np16_67" /> In the battle mode, the player gives orders to the characters on how to fight the monsters. Once the player defeats all of the monsters, the characters gain experience points and gold. The experience points raise the characters' experience levels. This improves the characters' attributes, and they may also learn new spells.

To win, the player must fight monsters to improve the characters' [[experience points|experience levels]] and get gold to buy better weapons and armor. Eventually, the player's characters become strong enough to make it to the next town or dungeon. This repeats until the player reaches the final boss and defeats him. However, the gameplay is not necessarily linear, especially after the player gets the boat. Exploration is a key component of the game. The game offers a few spots to save the game.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dragon Warrior II Instruction Booklet|year=1990|publisher=Enix America Corporation|page=8|chapter=Starting the Game}}</ref> In most of the towns, talking to a king or minister saves the game. In the American version, which incorporated a battery for saved games rather than the password system of the original, talking to the king also allows for the deletion and moving of saved games.<ref name="Kalata" />

''Dragon Quest II'' is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the previous game, ''Dragon Quest''.<ref name="gamespot" /> The game is the first in the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship.<ref name="np16_67" /> It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in an [[Open world|open-ended]] manner.<ref name="Kalata" /> It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles.<ref>(1990) Nintendo, Enix America Corporation Licensed Nintendo of America Inc. Dragon Warrior II Map (in English) ENI-D2-US.</ref> Compared with its predecessor, ''Dragon Warrior II'' offers a wider array of spells and items<ref name="enix_map">Enix Corporation Unveiled Secrets of Dragon Warrior II map (in English) Enix America Corporation.</ref> and a much larger world.<ref name="np16_67" /> The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters.<ref name="Kalata" /> ''Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line'' was also the first ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).<ref>{{cite book|title=Dragon Warrior II Instruction Booklet|year=1990|publisher=Enix America Corporation|pages=24, 26|chapter=Grographical Features}}</ref>

== Plot ==
''Dragon Quest II'' is set one hundred years after ''[[Dragon Quest (video game)|Dragon Quest]]''.<ref name="gamespot" /> The story begins with an attack upon Moonbrooke Castle by the wizard Hargon, who seeks to summon the demon Malroth to destroy the world.<ref name="Kalata" /> A wounded soldier escaped the battle and fled to the kingdom of Midenhall, where he informs the king of the attack before he dies. The king then commands his son, who is a descendant of [[Erdrick]] (known as Loto in Japanese translations and some later localizations), to defeat Hargon.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Prima Games |title=Dragon Warrior Monsters Official Strategy Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Prima Publishing |isbn=0-7615-2730-3 |page=234}}</ref><ref>Editors of Nintendo Power: Nintendo Power September/October, 1990; issue 16 (in English). Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 66.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Enix Corporation Unveiled Secrets of Dragon Warrior II | publisher=Enix America Corporation | page=3|chapter=Midenhall Castle }}</ref>

The Prince begins his quest alone, but is later joined by two cousins: the Prince of Cannock and the Princess of Moonbrooke.<ref name="enix_map" /> After finding the Prince of Cannock, who began a similar journey at the same time as the Prince of Midenhall, they restore the Princess of Moonbrooke to her human form, having been transformed into a dog during Hargon's assault on Moonbrooke Castle, which was reduced to ruins.<ref name="np16_67" /><ref name="enix_map" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Enix Corporation Unveiled Secrets of Dragon Warrior II | publisher=Enix America Corporation | page=9 |chapter=Moonbrooke Castle }}</ref> As the trio quest to find and defeat Hargon, they secure a ship that allows them to travel across oceans to reach new continents, including Alefgard, which is where ''Dragon Quest'' took place.<ref name="np16_67" /> There they meet the grandson of Dragonlord, the villain from the previous game, who gives the party valuable information.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Dragon Warrior |developer=Enix |publisher=Enix |date=2000-09-27 |platform=Game Boy Color|quote='''Dracolord's grandson''': You can call me Kid Draco... }}</ref> He tells them that by collecting the five crests hidden around the world, the party can create the Charm of Rubiss, allowing them to defeat Hargon and his illusions. After obtaining the Charm of Rubiss, the party travels to Hargon's castle in the ice-covered plateau of Rhone and confronts Hargon in his throne room. Hargon is defeated, but he offers himself to Malroth and the demon emerges to destroy the heroes. Together, the three heroes slay Malroth and return to Midenhall, where the Prince is named the new king.

== Development ==

Like other main games in the ''Dragon Quest'' series, [[Yuji Horii]] wrote the story for ''Dragon Quest II'', [[Akira Toriyama]] did the artwork, and [[Koichi Sugiyama]] composed the music. Co-creator [[Koichi Nakamura]], [[Chunsoft]]'s president, directed the game and did half of the programming.<ref name="Nakamura">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/features/koichi-nakamura-interview-console-rpg | title=Koichi Nakamura Interview: On the Birth of the Console RPG | author=Jeremy Parish | website=1UP.com | access-date=2013-06-21 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512112519/http://www.1up.com/features/koichi-nakamura-interview-console-rpg | archive-date=2013-05-12 }}</ref>

Planning for ''Dragon Quest II'' began in April 1986, a month before the release of the original ''Dragon Quest''. With the system and [[memory map]] decided, they started development in early July.<ref name="fami_8" /> At the beginning of development, producer Yukinobu Chida asked director and programmer Koichi Nakamura for a definite release date, and he offhandedly set one.<ref name="yutaka">{{cite book | script-title=ja:テレビゲームの神々―RPGを創った男たちの理想と夢 | author = Yutaka Tama | date= September 1994 | publisher = Koei |url=http://dragonquestage.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-84.html | isbn = 978-4877191467}}</ref> Then the development team was divided into two groups, with one designing the story, as well as the monsters, and one doing the programming.<ref name="fami_8" /> The initial deadline was set for early November, but the game ultimately suffered a small delay.<ref name="fami_8">{{cite magazine | magazine = Famitsu | issue = 8 | script-title = ja:「ドラゴンクエストII」ができるまで（前編） |trans-title=Making of "Dragon Quest II" (Part One) | year = 1987 | author=Yuji Horii |author-link=Yuji Horii|language=ja|url=http://dragonquestage.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-80.html}}</ref> The development team had finished programming almost everything by the time of the initial release and believed the game could be released by the end of that year.<ref name="fami_14">{{cite magazine | magazine = Famitsu | issue = 14 | script-title = ja:「ドラゴンクエストII」ができるまで（後編） |trans-title=Making of "Dragon Quest II" (Part Two) | year = 1987 | author=Yuji Horii |author-link=Yuji Horii|language=ja|url=http://dragonquestage.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-81.html}} (Translation is [http://shmuplations.com/dragonquestii/ available])</ref> In the Japanese magazine ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', published on November 11, 1986, it was announced that the game would be released in late December.<ref>[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]] issue 50 in 1986, released on 11 November 1986.[http://dragonquestage.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-84.html]</ref> However, the developers found that the game was too difficult, so it was delayed for a month to adjust the balance.<ref name="rush">{{cite magazine|magazine=WiLL (マンスリーウィル) 増刊 すぎやまこういち ワンダーランド |title=すぎやまこういち×中村光一 制作チームも"冒険"してきました|publisher =ワック出版局 | date=2011-11-09 |url=http://dragonquestage.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-84.html}}</ref> They had to finish the final version in mid-December,<ref name="fami_14" /> which they did, and then rushed to deliver to [[Nintendo]] to make the physical game cartridges.<ref name="rush" /> The game was released on January 26, 1987.<ref name="fami_14" />

The developers believed that ''Dragon Quest''{{'}}s one-vs-one combat system was "tedious" and too simple, and that the leveling system was "boring", so they decided to have ''Dragon Quest II'' use a party system with players controlling multiple characters.<ref name="fami_8" /> In another game from the time entitled ''[[Wizardry I|Wizardry]]'', players can control a party of up to six characters directly; Nakamura saw this, liked the idea, and wanted to do something similar.<ref name="yutaka" /> Due to technical restrictions, they decided to use only three characters; the Famicom video game system supports the display of up to eight [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s side by side, and one game character used two units in a direction, so it was possible for up to three characters to talk with a [[non-playable character]] (NPC).<ref name="fami_8" /> Yuji Horii believed many players would play ''Dragon Quest II'' without first playing ''Dragon Quest'', and thus had players search for the other party members.<ref name="Iwata Asks: History" /> During development, the staff discussed the idea of deprecating the "stair" command of the predecessor several times.<ref name="yutaka" /> Nakamura has stated that the Cave of Rhone found in the game is inspired by a classic trick to exit mazes, that of always moving forward while sticking to the right-hand side wall to avoid traps.<ref>{{Cite episode |title= チュンソフト |series= [[:ja:ゲームセンターCXの放送内容|ゲームセンターCX]]|network=[[:ja:フジテレビONE|フジテレビONE]], [[:ja:フジテレビNEXT|フジテレビNEXT]]|series-no=1 |date=2004-02-24 |number=8 |language=ja}}</ref>

In the story group, monsters were the first thing designed. The monsters' names, skills, and personalities were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full drawings rather than directly create the [[pixel art]] that would be shown in the game.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=メイキング・オブ・モンスター 堀井雄二VS鳥山明 対談|title=Dragon quest monsters |publisher= [[Shueisha]] | date=1996-12-01|isbn=978-4087820171|url=http://dragonquestage.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-84.html}}</ref> The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of this. Many new monsters needed to be designed to make the game feel real, and the process was laborious for Toriyama. But he has also said that, compared to the [[manga]] comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive.<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine= [[Kokoku Hihyo]] | script-title=ja:鳥山明インタビュー | date = July 1987 |url=http://dragonquestage.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-84.html}}</ref> Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story's plot in his mind. With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the place, like a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka. Compared with write lines in writing paper and design map in graph paper, staff wrote both two in 5&nbsp;mm graph papers of A4, as they felt that was easy for organizing;<ref name="fami_8" /> their manuscript thickness is 15&nbsp;cm.<ref>{{cite book | title = ファミコン神拳 奥義大全書 特別編 キム皇のファミコン神拳110番 | publisher = [[Shueisha]] | date =1987-04-25 | url=http://dragonquestage.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-35.html}}</ref>

Compared with its predecessor, the game was more advanced in nearly all technological aspects.<ref name="Kalata" /> Koichi Nakamura programmed with several students, but since it was his first time working with a team, he did not know how to delegate work or communicate his goals.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-06-08 |title=すべては『ドアドア』から始まった――チュンソフト30周年のすべてを中村光一氏と振り返るロングインタビュー【前編】 {{!}} ゲーム・エンタメ最新情報のファミ通.com |url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201406/08054671.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609010607/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201406/08054671.html |archive-date=2014-06-09 |access-date=2023-03-14 |website=ファミ通.com |language=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/chunsoft30th Translated] by Shmuplations.

Then they worked on characters, including numbered characters in maps for assigned lines, and designed the NPC's moving route. The next step was programming the items, while the final step was setting the monsters data and converting Toriyama's artwork.  This work was completed by the end of October.<ref name="fami_8" />

Due to the aforementioned balance issues, the game was initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat that he used to adjust the game's setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be very difficult.<ref name="fami_14" /> Furthermore, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura did not think over the boat, so if players get the boat to some land might be quickly defeated.<ref name="rush" /> The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.<ref name="fami_14" />

Due to a lack of cartridge space, many ideas were abandoned during development, such as an alternate ending that the Lorasia Prince is assassinated by the Prince of Cannock's sister if he dies in the final battle.<ref name="fami_14" /> Some elements were later used in remakes or sequels: a subplot about the Prince of Cannock being cursed was added to the Super Famicom remake and later remakes.<ref>[http://dragonquestage.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-83.html Special Goods of ''Famicom & Super Famicom Dragon Quest I·II·III'']</ref> Also, the Promontory of Olivia in ''Dragon Quest III'' was initially an idea for ''Dragon Quest II''.<ref>{{cite magazine| title=ドラゴンクエスト3マスターズクラブ|author=ファミコン必勝本編集部|magazine=JICC出版局 |date=November 1, 1988|url=http://dragonquestage.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-83.html|isbn=978-4880634876}}</ref> The game cartridge's ROM capacity is 1 Mbit,<ref name="famimaga114" /> but only about 10 bytes of free space remains in final products.<ref>[http://www.siliconera.com/2015/03/02/heres-what-etrian-mystery-dungeons-first-print-bonus-in-japan-includes/ First Print Bonus] of ''[[Etrian Mystery Dungeon]]''. p. 42</ref>

=== 1990 North American localization ===

The North American release of the game as ''Dragon Warrior II'' was created by Enix themselves and published in 1990.<ref name="Kalata">{{cite web| url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131926/the_history_of_dragon_quest.php?page=1 | title= The History of Dragon Quest | publisher= UBM Tech| author=Kurt Kalata | date=February 4, 2008 | access-date=2013-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122135029/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131926/the_history_of_dragon_quest.php?page=3|archive-date=2015-11-22}}</ref> Unlike the original Japanese Famicom version, which used [[password (video games)|passwords]] for [[saved game|saving]], the NES version used an internal [[battery backup]] instead to record the player's progress.<ref name="Kalata" /> The storyline introduction in Moonbrooke is presented exclusively in ''Dragon Warrior II''.<ref name="Kalata" /> In the Japanese original, the game starts right with the injured soldier from Moonbrooke entering Midenhall castle, seeking help from its king.<ref>'''Narration (first line of game translated)''': One day, a single wounded soldier arrived after a long struggle at Lorasia Castle.{{cite video game|title=Dragon Quest II |developer=Enix |publisher=Enix |date=1986-01-26 |platform=Famicom}}</ref> The dialogue of the American localization often used (intentionally) archaic English vocabulary, among other differences from the Japanese version.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dragon Quest II|url=http://www.dqshrine.com/dq/dq2/|publisher=dqshrine.com|access-date=18 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704084455/http://www.dqshrine.com/dq/dq2/|archive-date=2012-07-04}}</ref> Like ''Dragon Warrior'', the American version of ''Dragon Warrior II'' was censored in some aspects; for example, it used a ghost-like sprite instead of the original defeated character's coffin with cross sprite.<ref name="Kalata" />

=== Music ===

[[Koichi Sugiyama]] composed and directed the music for the game. The first album of ''Dragon Quest II'', ''Suite Dragon Quest II ~Gods of the Evil Spirits~'', was released in February 1987.

''Dragon Quest II'' was ported to [[MSX]] computers in February 1988,<ref>{{cite web|title=ドラゴンクエストII 悪霊の神々 (MSX1版)|url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=23570|publisher=Enterbrain|access-date=22 June 2013|language=ja}}</ref> but the ported version had many issues like choppy scrolling, black-surround characters titles, poor graphics, along with sluggish combat and menus.<ref name="Kalata" /> The MSX2-ported version was released in May 1988 in Japan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=23571 | title=ドラゴンクエストII 悪霊の神々 (MSX2版) | publisher=Enterbrain | language=ja}}</ref>

On December 18, 1993,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/archive/dq1-2_sfc/|title=ドラゴンクエスト I・II|publisher=Square Enix|access-date=2012-03-24|language=ja}}</ref> ''Dragon Quest II'' was [[Enhanced remake|remade]] and combined with ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' as part of ''Dragon Quest I & II'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]], which used ''Dragon Quest V''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s engine.<ref name="Kalata" /> Besides enhanced in graphics and sound, gameplay was also improved. The Super Famicom remake features an improved enemy targeting system: if an enemy is defeated before a character who was assigned to attack can perform its attack move, the character will attack another enemy rather than do nothing like in the Famicom version. And like its successors, players can find stat-improving items from pots or dressers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dragon Quest I+II|url=http://www.dqshrine.com/dq/dq1-2/|publisher=dqshrine.com|access-date=18 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022174320/http://www.dqshrine.com/dq/dq1-2/|archive-date=2012-10-22}}</ref> The Super Famicom remake was only released in Japan.<ref name="Kalata" />
