'''''Rasterscan''''' is a video game published in 1987 by [[Mastertronic]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[MSX]]. It was written by Binary Design based in Parsonage Gardens, [[Manchester]] with the C64 version programmed by Phillip Allsopp.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/amstrad-action-021 |title=Amstrad Action Issue 021}}</ref>

==Plot==
The ''Rasterscan'', a large damaged [[spacecraft]], is drifting uncontrollably towards a nearby star. The ''Rasterscan'' can still be controlled and piloted to safety but only by a [[android (robot)|droid]] called MSB. Unfortunately, MSB is also damaged and (without help) can only repair toasters. The player needs to control MSB and, hopefully, use it to save the unfortunate spacecraft.

==Gameplay==
The player controls MSB, a [[spherical]] droid who can float through the interior of the ship in all directions. MSB can interact with the craft's machinery and instruments, which all serve a purpose. It also needs to solve logic-puzzles in order to open doors (different puzzles for each door) to allow it access to more parts of the spacecraft.
