'''''Yes, Prime Minister''''' is a 1987 [[adventure game]] based on the [[Yes Minister|television series of the same name]]. It was developed by Oxford Digital Enterprises and published by Mosaic Publishing. It was released in Europe for [[Amstrad CPC]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]], [[DOS]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. Critics found it a faithful adaptation of the television series, but remarked on its high price, short length, and lack of long-term appeal.

==Gameplay==
''Yes, Prime Minister'' is based on the [[Yes, Prime Minister|television series of the same name]], and it plays like a [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]].<ref name=CU/><ref>{{cite book |last=Hawken |first=Kieren |title=The A-Z of Commodore 64 Games: Volume 3 |date=2019 |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |isbn=978-1-78982-116-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=piC3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT175 |access-date=26 March 2020}}</ref> Playing as British prime minister [[Jim Hacker]], the player starts out with a 50 percent approval rating and must work over a five-day period to improve the poll number. The player is aided by Hacker's secretaries, [[Humphrey Appleby]] and [[Bernard Woolley]]. The game is played through conversations between Hacker and other characters, such as Humphrey and Bernard, with the player continually selecting responses from a list of dialogue options. The outcome of the storyline can vary depending on the response that has been selected.<ref name=CU/><ref name=ACR/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=ACE/>

Gameplay takes place in Hacker's office, which includes various items such as an intercom, a [[telex]] machine, and two telephones. The player must answer a telephone when it rings and must also keep track of the time to avoid missing appointments with government officials. Scheduled meetings are written down in Hacker's diary. Other duties including reading memos that occasionally come in to Hacker's office. Poll numbers are accessible in a safe hidden behind a [[Union Jack]] flag.<ref name=CU/><ref name=ACR/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=ACE/>

''Yes, Prime Minister'' was praised as a faithful adaptation of the television series.<ref name=ACR/><ref name=CU/><ref name=CVG/><ref name=YCOM/><ref name=YS/><ref name=Z64/> Keith Campbell of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' wrote that the game is based so closely on the series that the result "is quite astonishing, and very entertaining." Campbell called the dialogue "impeccably written" and stated that Humphrey and Bernard's interaction with the player "is extremely well implemented, and conveys the mood of the TV series and the facets of the characters in it more closely than any other game I have seen."<ref name=CVG>{{cite magazine |last=Campbell |first=Keith |date=November 1987 |title=Adventure Preview: Yes, Prime Minister |magazine=Computer and Video Games |location=United Kingdom |pages=104–105}}</ref> ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' called the dialogue "really very witty in parts and every bit as good as the TV series."<ref name=ACE/> ''[[Commodore User]]'' wrote that the game has "a style of script virtually undistinguishable from those on TV," making the game "a must" for fans of the series.<ref name=CU>{{cite magazine |date=November 1987 |title=Yes Prime Minister |magazine=Commodore User |location=United Kingdom |page=108}}</ref> ''[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]'' wrote that the storylines "feel like they could have been lifted from the TV series.<ref name=YCOM>{{cite magazine |last=Gerrard |first=Mike |date=December 1987 |title=Yes, Prime Minister |magazine=Your Computer |location=United Kingdom |page=84}}</ref>

However, critics found the game too short, with little or no lasting appeal beyond the first round of play.<ref name=CC/><ref name=Crash/><ref name=ACE/><ref name=SU/><ref name=YCOM/><ref name=Z64/> ''ACE'' called the game "one of the biggest missed opportunities of the year."<ref name=ACE/> The magazine wrote that despite the possible scenarios, the game's variety "steadily grows stale, and the bulk of the game becomes depressingly familiar." ''ACE'' further wrote, "What you end up with is an initially enjoyable game, that turns out to be a disappointment."<ref name=ACE/> ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that while the game "certainly has something of the feel" of the television show, it "inevitably becomes repetitive." ''The Guardian'' concluded, "At least when you settle down to watch the television series, you know the storyline will be different each time!"<ref name=Guardian2>{{cite news |title=Computer Guardian |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/260289920/ |access-date=26 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=7 January 1988 |via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription}}</ref> Other reviewers praised the game's variety.<ref name=CU/><ref name=ACR/>

Some reviewers compared the game to Mosaic's earlier [[Adrian Mole]] game,<ref name=CU/><ref name=ACE/><ref name=YCOM/><ref name=Guardian2/> with ''[[Sinclair User]]'' calling ''Yes, Prime Minister'' a superior choice.<ref name=SU/> ''Sinclair User'', reviewing the ZX Spectrum version, opined that the digitised character images were poor,<ref name=SU/> although they were praised by other critics reviewing the C64 version.<ref name=ACR/><ref name=Z64/>

Critics found the game's initial release to be overpriced at £14.95.<ref name=CC/><ref name=Z64/><ref name=YCOM/><ref name=CU/> Some reviewers felt that the budget re-release was appropriately priced at £2.99,<ref name=CVG-1991/><ref name=Z64-2/> with ''[[Zzap!64]]'' writing that the "repetitiveness is more acceptable and the satirical humour is very amusing – at least for the first few goes."<ref name=Z64-2/> ''[[Commodore Format]]'' wrote that there is no incentive to play the game a second time "because the scenario remains almost exactly the same," stating that "because of the conversational nature of the game, a second play through can prove tedious."<ref name=CF/> ''[[Your Commodore|YC]]'', also reviewing the re-release, opined that the game was showing its age and that it would only appeal to fans of the series, while writing that it was a good value and worthwhile purchase for any fan.<ref name=YC/>
