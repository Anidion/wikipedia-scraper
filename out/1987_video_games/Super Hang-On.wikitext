{{nihongo foot|'''''Super Hang-On'''''|スーパーハング・オン|Sūpā Hangu On|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a motorcycle [[Racing game|racing]] [[arcade video game]] released by [[Sega]] as the sequel to ''[[Hang-On]]''. It uses a simulated [[motorcycle]] [[arcade cabinet]], like the original game. An updated  version was released in arcades 1991 as '''''Limited Edition Hang-On'''''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Super Hang-On.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]
The arcade mode in ''Super Hang-On'' is similar to the original ''Hang-On'', but there is a choice of four tracks to race on which are based on continents, each containing a different number of stages. Also, should the player reach the normal maximum speed of 280 km/h, a turbo button is enabled. Using this button allows the player to reach an even higher top speed of 324 km/h. Each stage is roughly half the length of a stage in the original ''Hang-On''. [[Africa]] is the easiest and shortest out of the four courses (six stages). [[Asia]] is the second easiest and is similar in length to the course from the original ''Hang-On'' at ten stages long. The [[Americas]] is the second to toughest course, containing 14 stages and [[Europe]] is the hardest course, being 18 stages long. When the player starts a race, they have their choice of four songs that will play during the race, a feature borrowed from ''[[Out Run]]''.

The Sega Mega Drive version of the game included the full arcade game, and an additional ''original mode'', which allowed players to recruit sponsors and earn money to buy enhanced components for their bike.<ref>{{cite book|title=Super Hang On game manual|date=1989|publisher=Sega|pages=10, 16, 28–38|edition=PAL}}</ref> The cover for this version has a bike and rider in the same colors as [[Shinichi Itoh]], who competed in the All-Japan 500 cc Championship on a Rothmans [[Honda NSR500]].

==Ports==
Versions of the game were released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Commodore 64]] in 1987 with further home conversions following for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Macintosh]], [[X68000]], and [[MS-DOS]] in 1989 and 1990.<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Hang-On|url=http://segaretro.org/Super_Hang-On|website=SegaRetro|access-date=1 August 2016}}</ref> The game also appeared on several Mega Drive compilations, namely ''Mega Games I'' (bundled with the console as ''Mega Drive Magnum Set''), and ''Sega 6-Pak''.

It was included in ''[[Sega Arcade Gallery]]'' for [[Game Boy Advance]].

The arcade version was released on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in Japan on September 14, 2010, and later in North America and Europe on May 3, 2012. Like ''[[Shinobi (arcade game)|Shinobi]]'' and its omission of any references to [[Marilyn Monroe]], the Virtual Console version of ''Super Hang-On'' was slightly altered to avoid any copyright troubles. This includes the replacing of several in-game billboards which used to feature real brand names such as Cibie with similar billboards which mention other Sega games such as ''OutRun'' and ''After Burner''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=SilverStarRipper|title=Hang-On|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/hangon/hangon.htm|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=1 August 2016|archive-date=11 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311165203/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/hangon/hangon.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> This version would be released on Xbox Live Arcade in 2012 as part of ''[[Sega Vintage Collection]]: Alex Kidd & Co''.
