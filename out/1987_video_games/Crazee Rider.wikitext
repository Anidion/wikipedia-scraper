'''''Crazee Rider''''' is a [[motorbike racing]] [[video game]] created by Kevin Edwards and published by [[Superior Software]] in 1987.<ref name="giantlist"/> It was released for the [[Acorn Electron]] and [[BBC Micro]] with an enhanced version for the [[BBC Master]]. The game was particularly well received for the Electron as it was the first 3D racing game with corners for that machine.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

==Gameplay==
[[Image:CrazeeRider-electron.png|thumb|left|Acorn Electron screenshot showing a corner on the Le Mans circuit.]]
The player competes as one of sixty riders in a series of motorbike races held on the real life race circuits [[Bugatti Circuit|Le Mans]], [[Scandinavian Raceway|Anderstorp]], [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard]], [[Brands Hatch]], [[Misano World Circuit|Misano]], [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] and the [[Nürburgring]]. The player must finish in the top six in order to qualify for the next race.

As the race begins, the player's bike is slow to accelerate so the rest of the field speed past. The player must attempt to catch and pass the other racers. The player may also gain bonus points by knocking the other racers off their bikes by side swiping them when the player is slightly in front. If the computer controlled racer is slightly in front when the bikes clash, it will cause the player to slow down. If the player hits the back of another bike, their bike is disabled for a short time.<ref>Original instructions, Superior Software</ref>

==Development==
The game was originally conceived as an Acorn Electron car racing game as a follow-up to the hugely successful ''[[Overdrive (video game)|Overdrive]]''. That game was the only 3D racing game available for the Electron so despite only having straight tracks, became Superior Software's biggest selling game.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Heading For The Century|first=Tony|last=Leah|volume=7|issue=2|date=November 1989|pages=36–38|magazine=Electron User|publisher=Database Publications}} <!--[http://www.stairwaytohell.com/articles/EUFEB89-Superior.html]--></ref> In late 1986, Superior reissued [[Acornsoft]]'s BBC Micro only racing simulation ''[[Revs (video game)|Revs]]'' and were also working on the ''[[Grand Prix Construction Set]]'', set for release in 1987. Neither of these games were able to be converted for the Electron. After completing the [[shoot 'em up]] ''[[Galaforce]]'', Superior asked Kevin Edwards if he would be interested in writing an Electron racing game.<ref name=corners>{{cite magazine|title=No Cutting Corners On Crazee Rider|first=Edwards|last=Kevin|volume=4|issue=12|date=September 1987|pages=38–39|magazine=Electron User|publisher=Database Publications|access-date=11 March 2023|url=http://www.stairwaytohell.com/authors/kedwards/EUSEP87-CrazeeRider.html}}</ref> During development, it was decided to change the game to a motorbike racer and to also release it on the BBC Micro.<ref name="corners"/>

The Electron version runs in a four colour mode with the player able to change the three main colours (the fourth always remaining black). The standard BBC Micro version is virtually identical but runs in an eight colour mode. An enhanced version was included for the BBC Master which included more circuits, extra in-game graphics (including extra animation and different coloured opponents) and music by [[Martin Galway]].<ref name="a&b"/><ref name="music">[http://www.cvgm.net/demovibes/song/7199/ ''Crazee Rider''] at Computer and Video Game Music</ref>

==Release==
''Crazee Rider'' was published in 1987 on [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and 5.25" [[Disc Filing System|DFS]] [[floppy disk]] as well as [[Advanced Disc Filing System|ADFS]] 3.5" disk for the [[Acorn Electron#Acorn Plus 3|Acorn Electron Plus 3]] and [[BBC Master#Master Compact|Master Compact]]. The original release included a competition prize of a [[Pound sterling|£]]500 [[moped]].<ref name="superior">[http://www.beebgames.com/rhinterv.php "Interview: The Superior Software Years and The Future"], Crispin Boylan, The BBC Games Archive, 1998</ref>

The game was included on the ''Play It Again Sam 2'' compilation in 1988 and also re-released in 1989 as part of the Superior/[[Blue Ribbon (software house)|Blue Ribbon]] budget range.

==Reception==
''[[Electron User]]'' called the game "superb", giving an overall score of 9/10 (with 10/10 for both playability and value for money) with reviewer Joanne Hutcheson concluding "''Crazee Rider'' is an exciting game - it's fast, challenging and there's plenty to keep you entertained".<ref name="electron user">[http://8bs.com/elecgame/crazee_rider.htm "On Yer Bike!"], Electron User #4.12, September 1987</ref> A&B Computing, who concentrated on the BBC Micro, were less impressed, awarding only 7/10. Reviewer Dave Reeder claimed: "There is nothing here that marks bold new steps into unknown programming areas - the game is solidly put together but is not up to the usual high standard of Superior releases for the [[BBC Micro|Beeb]]". He did however concede that "The Electron version is what counts and here, I'm told, it does things at great speed to amaze Electron owners".<ref name="a&b">[http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/aab/revs/superior_acornsoft/r-craz.html ''Crazee Rider'' review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820142010/http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/aab/revs/superior_acornsoft/r-craz.html |date=2011-08-20}}, A&B Computing, vol 4 no 10, October 1987</ref>
