'''''Soft & Cuddly''''' is a horror [[action-adventure game]] released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] home computer. It was developed by John George Jones and published by The Power House in September 1987 in the United Kingdom and in early 1988 in Spain. The player assumes the role of a man armed with a [[laser gun]] and a [[jet pack]], whose mother, the Android Queen, has been [[Dismemberment|dismembered]]. The player's task is to locate the scattered body parts of the Android Queen and sew her back together.

Jones had previously developed a game called ''Go to Hell''. In an interview he stated that he developed the game for his own amusement; he enjoyed the reactions people gave to the game. The original, pre-release, version of the game featured more grisly images. Reviewers praised the game's graphics but had mixed feeling about the scenes actually depicted by the graphics. Some reviewers criticized the game's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being fun and akin to a [[horror film]] by others.

The object of the game is to collect the eight pieces of the Android Queen's body then stitch her back together again. The player must first find and approach the refrigerator in order to be told where the first body part can be found. Once this has been returned to the player's trapped father, the next body part location will be revealed. Once all eight body parts have been collected and returned to the refrigerator, the player must find a needle and thread in order to restore the Android Queen.<ref name="inlay"/><ref name="crash"/> The location of the refrigerator is randomized at the beginning of each new game.<ref name="inlay">''Soft & Cuddly'' inlay</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Snout| first = Philip | title = YS Tip Shop Hints 'N' Tips| journal = [[Your Sinclair]]| issue = 26 | pages = 38| publisher = [[Dennis Publishing]]| date = February 1988 }}</ref>

The game world consists of a number of rooms and passages with background scenery including a machine which stretches four conjoined babies and men being torn apart on [[Rack (torture)|racks]]. The game's rooms are filled with enemies and traps such as spiked ceilings, falling anvils and airborne spinning blades. The [[player character]] is armed with a laser gun and a jet pack which is used to fly around the game world.<ref name="su"/> The laser can overheat and become inoperable for a time if not used sparingly.<ref name="crash">{{cite journal | last = Candy| first = Robin |author2=Sumner, Paul |author3=Roberts, Nick| title = Reviews&nbsp;– Soft & Cuddly| journal = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| issue = 44| pages = 108| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications]]| date = September 1987}}</ref> Scenery and surfaces can be degraded then destroyed by repeated laser fire, allowing access to adjacent rooms which would otherwise be unreachable or require a detour.<ref name="su"/> The player starts each game with three lives;<ref name="crash"/> the game's display features a heart strength indicator which is reduced each time the player is injured.

==Development and release==
''Soft & Cuddly'' was developed for The Power House by John George Jones. Jones had previously developed ''Go to Hell'' for Triple Six.<ref name="su"/> ''Go to Hell'' was published in 1985 and featured "...revolting, crude and downright vile images."<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reviews&nbsp;– Go To Hell| journal = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| issue = 19| pages = 45| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications]]| date = August 1985}}</ref> When interviewed by ''[[Sinclair User]]'', in the October 1987 issue, the programmer was asked "Whatever possessed you to write a game like Soft and Cuddly...".<ref name="interview">{{cite journal | title = C.O.D.E. T.A.L.K.&nbsp;– John George Jones| journal = [[Sinclair User]]| issue = 67 | pages = 37| publisher = [[EMAP]]| date = October 1987 }}</ref> To this Jones responded, "I didn't write the game because I'm a horrible person, I wrote it to amuse myself."<ref name="interview"/> Jones also stated "I love the reaction people give, I can't stand 'nice' inoffensive things...".<ref name="interview"/> The original version of the game was more gruesome; the babies were being torn apart rather than stretched and "...the sheep was bouncing up and down on a corpse."<ref name="interview"/> When asked how long he would retain interest in computers, Jones stated that he had already lost interest.<ref name="interview"/> ''Soft & Cuddly'' was released by The Power house during September 1987 in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Whodunwot | journal = [[Sinclair User]]| issue = 66 | pages = 5| publisher = [[EMAP]]| date = September 1987 }}</ref> The game was later released in Spain during the first quarter of 1988.<ref name="mh"/> The game featured in a competition printed in the November 1987 issue of ''[[Sinclair User]]''. The first prize was a day in the company of The Power House's staff including a trip to the [[London Dungeon]]. Other prize winners received a copy of ''Soft & Cuddly'' or a poster of the game's inlay artwork.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Competition | journal = [[Sinclair User]]| issue = 68 | pages = 105| publisher = [[EMAP]]| date = November 1987 }}</ref>

''Soft & Cuddly'' received average review scores from critics. The game's graphics were praised; ''Sinclair User'' reviewer Jim Douglas stated "Graphically, it is certainly unusual, and occasionally brilliant."<ref name="su"/> ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' magazine's three reviewers also praised the graphics but raised some issues. Nick Roberts described them as smooth and slick, but stated that they were "a mite sketchy".<ref name="crash"/> Roberts also stated "colour is used very well."<ref name="crash"/> Paul Sumner stated "There are some {{Sic|?|hide=y|cleverly|-}}animated and {{Sic|?|hide=y|attractively|-}}coloured graphics".<ref name="crash"/> Robin Candy said they are the game's greatest asset.<ref name="crash"/>

Reviewers held differing opinions on the game's setting and themes. Sumner stated the game is "dragged down by distasteful graphics and a horribly grim inlay."<ref name="crash"/> Roberts described the game as "sick", adding "I only recommend Soft & Cuddly to those of you who cut your toenails with a carving knife!"<ref name="crash"/> Douglas was critical of the game's themes; he described playing ''Soft & Cuddly'' as "watching very large and unpleasant graphics jigging up and down like a box of offal".<ref name="su"/> Tony Lee of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' was more positive, stating, "This is a very sick game indeed, but fortunately I have a very sick sense of humour."<ref name="ys"/>

The overall game received a more positive reception from Lee and ''MicroHobby'' magazine's reviewer as opposed to the reviewers from ''Crash'' and ''Sinclair User''. MicroHobby's reviewer called ''Soft & Cuddly'' a typical arcade adventure with a performance worthy of a horror movie.<ref name="mh"/> Douglas stated, "The actual playing of the game is, unfortunately, a rather tiresome business." He criticized the game for consisting of character movement coupled with occasional item gathering. Douglas described the game's enemies as being "bog standard cannon fodder aliens",<ref name="su"/> saying "they drift around being annoying and sapping your energy."<ref name="su"/> Candy stated that "It's very easy to get into, but boring."<ref name="crash"/> He added that exploration is the best part of the game but becomes repetitive. Sumner stated "all there is to Soft & Cuddly is graphics. The gameplay is repetitive."<ref name="crash"/> Lee said that the game is fun; "I love this one."<ref name="ys"/>

Nearly thirty years after its release, ''Soft & Cuddly'' was the subject of a book published by [[Boss Fight Books]] in 2016, written by Jarett Kobek.<ref>Kobek, Jarett. ''Soft & Cuddly''. Boss Fight Books, 2016.</ref>
