'''''The Universal Military Simulator''''' is a [[computer game]] developed by [[Rainbird Software]] in 1987 for the [[Macintosh]], Tandy 4000, and [[IBM PC compatible]]s.  In 1988, both [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]] versions were released. The game was created by Ezra Sidran. The PC and Amiga versions were ported by Ed Isenberg. The game spawned two sequels: ''[[UMS II: Nations at War]]'' and ''[[The War College: Universal Military Simulator 3]]''.

==Gameplay==
''The Universal Military Simulator'' is a computer wargame which allows players to create armies and battlefields, using three-dimensional terrain to place features such as towns and hills. Players can reenact historical battles such as [[Battle of Hastings|Hastings]], [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], [[Battle of Gaugamela|Arbela]], and [[Battle of Marston Moor|Marston Moor]]. The player can zoom in on specific combat units to plan strategy. The player has the option to play against a human opponent.<ref name="Dragon137"/>

M. Evan Brooks reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Overall, UMS is impressive, but its flaws are apparent. If you are interested in creating your own battles, then UMS is highly recommended. On the other hand, if you desire to learn accurate lessons from military history, then UMS may be a shade too general."<ref name="CGW51">{{cite magazine |last=Brooks |first=M.

The game was reviewed in 1988 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #137 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon137">{{cite journal

The magazine cited as weaknesses the lack of navies, awkward user interface, and a [[Battle of Waterloo]] scenario that completely omitted the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].<ref name="brooks199010">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: Pre-20th Century | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1990 | accessdate=16 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

In 1993 a bundle called "''The Complete Universal Military Simulator''" was released that included the original game, the "''Nations at War''" sequel, and a "Planet Editor" that let users design planets, weather systems, nations, AIs, event effects, and scenarios as well as unit types and armies. Reviewing the package in ''[[Amiga Format]]'', Richard Jones gave it a rating of 74%, writing that it wasn't recommended for "frivolous gamers after a quick thrill", but "is a must for the serious war gamer."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Richard|title=Universal Military Simulator: The Complete Compilation Pack|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_2864|website=Amiga Format|accessdate=23 April 2017|pages=86–87|date=November 1993}}</ref>
