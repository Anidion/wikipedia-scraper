It was released in Europe for [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] (C64), and [[ZX Spectrum]].<ref name=Crash/><ref name=TGM/><ref name=Z64/><ref name=ASM/> In the game, [[Yogi Bear]] sets out to rescue [[Boo-Boo Bear|Boo-Boo]] after he is captured by a hunter. ''Yogi Bear'' received praise for its graphics, but criticism for its controls.

==Gameplay==
''Yogi Bear'' is a [[side-scrolling]] [[arcade adventure]] that takes place in Jellystone Park. [[Boo-Boo Bear|Boo-Boo]] is captured by a hunter who intends to sell him to a circus, and it is up to [[Yogi Bear]] to rescue him.<ref name=Z64/><ref name=YS/> Playing as Yogi Bear, the player must travel across Jellystone Park and find Boo-Boo before a time limit runs out, while also avoiding numerous obstacles such as [[geyser]]s and rivers. Enemies such as snakes, frogs, hunters, and [[Ranger Smith]] must also be avoided. Yogi can jump and duck to avoid obstacles, and can also disguise himself as a bush to hide from enemies. Yogi's energy gradually depletes as the game progresses, but it can be regained by eating food located in unaccompanied picnic baskets.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=Ace1/><ref name=CU/><ref name=CVG/>

Cave entrances, accessible at certain points in the game, transport the player to random areas of the park. In some cases, the player will be transported closer to Boo-Boo's location after using a cave, while other times the player will be sent further back. Upon finding Boo-Boo, the player must walk across [[stepping stones]] in a certain order. Located throughout the game are toffee apples that have been left behind by Boo-Boo. The player has the option of collecting the apples, which will later inform the player of which stones to step upon. However, using cave entrances to skip ahead in the game can result in some apples being passed up.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=Ace1/><ref name=CU/><ref name=CVG/><ref>{{cite book |last=Hawken |first=Kieren |title=The A-Z of Sinclair ZX Spectrum Games: Volume 3 |date=2018 |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |isbn=978-1-78538-946-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHWFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT180 |access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

The game received criticism for its poor controls.<ref name=Crash/><ref name=TGM/><ref name=Z64/><ref name=ASM>{{cite magazine |last=Ruuben |first=Astrid |date=December 1987 |title=Auf der Suche nach Boo Boo |magazine=[[Aktueller Software Markt]] |location=Germany |language=de |page=44}}</ref> Tony Worrall of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' considered the game's [[collision detection]] poor, but stated that it sometimes works in the player's favor as a result. Despite its simplicity, Worrall considered the game addictive.<ref name=YS/> Tamara Howard of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' considered the game fun but bizarre.<ref name=SU/> Paul Boughton of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' described the game as a "simple left to right scrolling effort which lacked any immediate hookability to keep me playing."<ref name=CVG>{{cite magazine |last=Boughton |first=Paul |date=November 1987 |title=Yogi Bear (C64) |magazine=Computer and Video Games |location=United Kingdom |pages=4, 44–45}}</ref> Anatol Locker of ''Power Play'' also found the game to be monotonous, citing its lack of variety.<ref name=PP/>

Phil King of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' reviewed a 1989 budget re-release of the game and stated that while the characters look great, the "'cardboard cut-out' 3-D is confusing, with dodgy collision detection making it almost unplayable."<ref name=Crash2/>
