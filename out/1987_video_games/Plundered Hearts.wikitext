'''''Plundered Hearts''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] [[video game]] created by [[Amy Briggs]] and published by [[Infocom]] in 1987. Infocom's only game in the [[romance novel|romance]] genre, it was released simultaneously for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], [[classic Mac OS]], and [[MS-DOS]]. It is Infocom's twenty-eighth game.

==Plot==
''Plundered Hearts'' casts the player in a well-defined role. The lead character is a young woman in the late 17th century who has received a letter. Jean Lafond, the [[governor]] of the small [[West Indies]] island of St. Sinistra, says that the player's father has contracted a "wasting tropical disease". Lafond suggests that his recovery would be greatly helped by the loving presence of his daughter, and sends his ship (the ''Lafond Deux'') to transport her.

As the game begins, the ship is attacked by pirates and the player's character is kidnapped. Eventually the player's character finds that two men are striving for her affections: dashing pirate Nicholas Jamison, and the conniving Jean Lafond. As the intrigue plays out, the lady does not sit idly by and watch the men duel over her; she must help Jamison overcome the evil plans of Lafond so they have a chance to live happily ever after.

==Development==
As early as 1984 Infocom employees joked about the possibility of a romance text adventure, although ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' observed that "somehow the moves don't seem appropriate to a computer keyboard".<ref name="dyer19840506">{{cite news |url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/globe84.html |title=Masters of the Game |last=Dyer |first=Richard |date=1984-05-06 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970607204921/http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/globe84.html |archive-date=1997-06-07}}</ref> By 1987, the year of ''Plundered Hearts'''s release, Infocom no longer rated its games on difficulty level.

Although this was not the only Infocom game designed in an effort to attract female players (see also ''[[Moonmist]]''), it is the only game in which the lead character is always female.

==Release==
The ''Plundered Hearts'' package included an "elegant velvet reticule" (pouch) containing the following items:
#A 50 [[Guinea (coin)|guinea]] banknote from St. Sinistra
#A letter from Jean Lafond reporting the illness of the player character's father

==Reception==
Game reviewers Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser complimented ''Plundered Hearts'' in their "The Role of Computers" column in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #128 (1987), citing its "gripping prose, challenging predicaments, and scenes of derring-do".<ref name="Dragon128">{{cite journal | title=The Role of Computers | last1=Lesser | first1=Hartley | last2=Lesser | first2=Patricia | last3=Lesser | first3=Kirk | journal=Dragon | issue=128 | date=December 1987 | pages=92â€“96}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' said "this might be the perfect gift for your 'significant other' so that she can understand why interactive fiction is so fascinating".<ref name="cgw198711">{{cite magazine | title=Christmas Buyers Guide | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=November 1987 | pages=20 | url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_41/page/n19/mode/2up | issue=41}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' praised ''Plundered Hearts''{{'}} writing and said that the game was suitable for both men and women.<ref name="trunzo198801">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-01-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_092_1988_Jan#page/n45/mode/2up | title=Plundered Hearts And Nord And Bert Couldn't Make Head Or Tail Of It | work=Compute! | date=January 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Trunzo, James V. | pages=44}}</ref> ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' approved of the game's "intrigue, adventure and, yes, romance" but regretted that "most of Infocom's regular audience (presumably male) are likely to forsake this bold new endeavor" because of its genre.<ref name="panak198809">{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/analog/issue64/panak.php | title=Panak Strikes | work=ANALOG Computing | date=September 1988 | accessdate=30 January 2015 | author=Panak, Steve | pages=83}}</ref>
