'''''Wings of Fury''''' is a [[scrolling shooter]], with some [[Combat flight simulation game|combat flight simulator]] elements, originally written for the [[Apple II]] by Steve Waldo and released in 1987 by [[Broderbund]]. The player assumes the role of a pilot of an American [[F6F Hellcat]] plane aboard the [[USS Wasp (CV-18)|USS ''Wasp'']] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]] during [[World War II]]. It was also released in 1989 for the [[X68000]] and in 1990 for [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], and [[MS-DOS]] compatible operating systems. A [[Game Boy Color]] version was published in 1999.

==Gameplay==
The game is a horizontally scrolling shooter set over a number of World War II missions. In each mission, the player must protect an aircraft carrier from attacks by Japanese planes. The goal is to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, guns and barracks on a series of islands and killing enemy soldiers either with bombs or by machine guns. The weapons to complete these objectives, besides machine guns, are a limited number of bombs, rockets and torpedoes. On some missions, the player must also sink Japanese vessels, such as destroyers, battleships, and aircraft carriers. The player has a finite amount of fuel and munitions, which can be replenished by returning to the carrier. The player's aircraft can be destroyed by accumulated damage from enemy fire or by crashing into the terrain.

The combatants are reversed for the Japanese [[X68000]] home computer version released by Broderbund Japan. The player's airplane is a Japanese [[Zero fighter]] and the enemies are Americans.<ref name='MyAbandonware'>{{cite web |url= https://www.myabandonware.com/game/wings-of-fury-ta |title= Wings of Fury |last= HOTUD |date= |website= |publisher= My Abandonware |access-date= 4 February 2021 |quote=}}</ref>
