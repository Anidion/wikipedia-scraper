== Story ==
The mad professor has returned, seeking revenge after Agent X foiled his plan to brainwash the President.  This time he is out to ruin the world economy.  He has set up an underground base on the Moon.  From this hideout he plans to unleash his terrible Zit-Ray, a device that causes everybody to break out in terrible terminal acne. The mad prof plans that, with spending so much money on spot remover cream - which, due to the terrible effects of the Zit-Ray, will not work anyway - the economy will be in ruins, as no-one will have any money left for essentials.  Agent X must travel to the Moon, surprise the scientist, and destroy the zit-ray,<ref name="Inlay">{{Citation|title=Agent X II Inlay|publisher=[[Mastertronic]]}}</ref>

Agent X II is split into three different subgames.  The first level is a side scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] in a similar vein to [[Gradius]].  Level 2 is a platform game, set in a tower of screens, each with three floors. Each screen contains a computer terminal, a floating code number, and an assortment of enemies. Agent X must jump from level to level collecting codes, entering them into the computers and killing the aliens. After three codes have been entered, a final code must be typed into the lowest terminal and a snake-like alien destroyed before the task is completed.  The third and final level is a [[Breakout clone]].<ref name="YS_Review">{{Citation|title=Agent X II Review|first=Nat|newspaper=[[Your Sinclair]]|date=January 1988|last=Pryce}}</ref>
