'''''Desert Falcon''''' is a [[scrolling shooter]] developed by [[General Computer Corporation]] for the [[Atari 7800]] and [[Atari 2600]] and published by [[Atari Corporation]] in 1987. It was initially announced in 1984, prior to being named ''Desert Falcon'', as one of the planned launch titles for the 7800. A cartridge version for [[Atari 8-bit computers]], with [[Atari XEGS|XEGS]]-styled packaging, followed in 1988.

Designed by Bob Polaro, who also programmed the Atari 2600 version, ''Desert Falcon'' is loosely based on ancient Egyptian mythology. The diagonally-scrolling [[isometric projection|isometric graphics]] had reviewers comparing it to Sega's ''[[Zaxxon]]'' from 1982.<ref name=analog/><ref name=nau/>

==Plot==
Players take on the role of a [[falcon]], striving to collect the [[Pharaoh]]'s scattered treasures in the desert to earn points.

==Gameplay==
The game uses a scrolling, isometric perspective. Vultures, warriors, flying fish, and other creatures guard treasures and try to stop the player. At the end of each level, the player faces a large, howling [[sphinx]] before moving forward. The falcon can shoot arrows to eliminate foes and defeat the sphinx.

Throughout the game are [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] in the sand. Landing and hopping over three hieroglyphs unlock what are labeled "super powers" in the manual.<ref name=manual/> The specific combination of collected hieroglyphs determines the acquired ability, including invincibility, teleportation to a level's end, bonus points, a decoy to mislead enemies, and an air bomb that annihilates all airborne opponents.<ref name=eg_gameplay/>

==Development==
The game was revealed in 1984 as part of the Atari 7800 announcement. It was referred to as both ''Sphinx'' and ''Nile Flyer''.<ref name=eg_intro/>

==Reception==
Reviewing the Atari 8-bit version for ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' in 1989, Matthew J.W. Ratcliff wrote, "''Desert Falcon'' has good graphics, cute sound effects, and a tired, boring theme."<ref name=analog/> He cited ''Zaxxon'' several times, calling ''Desert Falcon'' a visually different spin on the same gameplay. ''[[Page 6|New Atari User]]'' wrote, "The scrolling in ''Desert Falcon'' isn't quite as smooth as it could be," but complimented the animation of the falcon and the use of shadows.<ref name=nau/> In ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'', David Plotkin wrote, "The manual describes a wide variety of enemies. Unfortunately, except for some flying triangles, they all looked pretty much alike".<ref name=antic/> He still concluded with "It has excellent graphics and is very playable."<ref name=antic/>

After playing the 7800 cartridge, Len Poggiali of ''Current Notes'' described it as "an average arcade game with a below average plot and above average visual appeal."<ref name=current/>
