'''''Wizards & Warriors''''', titled '''''{{nihongo|Densetsu no Kishi Elrond|伝説の騎士エルロンド|''Legendary Knight Elrond''}}''''' in Japan, is an [[Action game|action]] [[platform game|platform]] video game developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Acclaim Entertainment]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was released in North America in December 1987, and in Europe on January 7, 1990. The player controls Kuros, "Knight Warrior of the ''Books of Excalibur''", as he sets out in the Kingdom of Elrond to defeat the evil wizard Malkil. Malkil holds the princess of Elrond captive in Castle IronSpire, deep within the forests of Elrond. The player fights through forests, tunnels, and caves, while collecting keys, treasure, weapons, and magic items.

It is Acclaim's first game as the domestic publisher, and Rare's second NES game, after ''[[Slalom (video game)|Slalom]]'' (1987). In the months surrounding its North American and European releases, ''Wizards & Warriors'' was featured in several video game magazines, including ''[[Nintendo Fun Club News]]'', ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', and ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]''. It was praised for its graphics, sound, difficulty, and arcade-style gameplay. In 2010, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' called it "a unique experience for NES gamers in 1987" that was "technically well ahead of other games for the console at the time", but attributed its relatively low difficulty to allowing unlimited [[continue (video gaming)|continue]]s without penalty.<ref name="RG" /> ''Wizards & Warriors'' was followed by three sequels: ''[[Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors&nbsp;II]]'' (1989), ''[[Wizards & Warriors&nbsp;X: The Fortress of Fear]]'' (1990), and ''[[Wizards & Warriors&nbsp;III: Kuros: Visions of Power]]'' (1992).

==Gameplay==
''Wizards & Warriors'' is a [[platform game]] in which players control Kuros through the forests of Elrond to Castle IronSpire, where he must defeat Malkil and rescue the princess.<ref name="Manual34">[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], pp. 3–4.</ref> Starting in the Elrond forest, players explore the trees to find items and to reach the caves and tunnels. There, various magical items and treasure are collected, and then caves filled with ice and lava are explored. Players fight through a second set of forests, and arrive at Castle IronSpire. It consists of a series of mazes in which players must use keys to open doors and possibly rescue other damsels. At the end lies the final confrontation with the wizard Malkil.<ref name="Manual57">[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], pp. 5–7.</ref>

[[File:Wizards & Warriors.png|thumb|left|Kuros is about to obtain the red key, to open the red treasure chest below.]]
Players use the control pad to move horizontally and to crouch. Kuros can attack enemies by using his Brightsword or with other weapons and magic.<ref name="Manual10">[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], p. 10.</ref> He can attack enemies while in the air or while standing by holding the sword in position.<ref name="RG" /> The objective of the game is to collect the various weapons, magic, gems, and treasure to overcome the enemies and other obstacles and hazards. Gems are required to bribe the creature who guards the entrance to the next level.<ref name="Manual78">[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], pp. 7–8.</ref><ref name="Manual1217">[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], pp. 12–17.</ref> At the end of each level is a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] creature that has been empowered by Malkil's black magic. Bosses have an "Enemy's Black Magic Power" meter that shows how difficult the boss is, how many hits are required to defeat it, and what type of weaponry needs to be used.<ref name="FunClub">{{cite magazine |last=Reviewee |first=Louie |title=''Wizards & Warriors'' | magazine=[[Nintendo Fun Club News]] |issue=7 |date=June–July 1988 |pages=8–9}}</ref> Kuros has a [[Health (gaming)|life meter]] that decreases as time passes and when he sustains damage from enemies. Players loses a life when Kuros's life meter runs out, but keep all items. The [[game over|game ends]] when all three lives have been lost, but may [[continue (video gaming)|continue]]; upon continuing, all items remain, but the score is reset to zero. Kuros's life meter is replenished by collecting pieces of meat scattered throughout the levels.<ref name="Manual1718">[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], pp. 17–18.</ref>

Helpful items are inside acorns, torches, and treasure chests. Chests and doors are color-coded and require a key of matching color.<ref name="FunClub" /> Some weapons and magic items are replaced upon collecting a new item. Items include the following: "Boots of Force" that can kick open chests and doors; magical potions that temporarily grant Kuros invulnerability, extra speed, or extra jumping ability; gems to help bribe the end-of-level guardian; a shield to protect from enemy attacks; the "Potion of Levitation" that allows Kuros to float upward; the "Dagger of Throwing" and the "Battle Axe of Agor" that are thrown at enemies and return like a [[boomerang]]; the "Feather of Feather Fall" that slows Kuros's falling speed; the "Wand of Wonder" and "Staff of Power" that shoot out balls of ice and fire, respectively; the "Cloak of Darkness" that makes Kuros invisible to enemies; the "Boots of Lava Walk" that allows Kuros to walk on the lava; "Exploding Eggs" that destroys all on-screen enemies; "Alarm Clocks" that stop all enemies for a brief period; knife and axe upgrades; and a "horn" (trumpet) to reveal hidden doors to gem caves. Score increases include coins, orbs, chalices, entire hoards of treasure, and rescuing the damsels.<ref name="Manual1217" />

==Plot==
''Wizards & Warriors'' pits the hero Kuros, the "Knight Warrior of the ''Books of Excalibur''",<ref name="FunClub" /> against the main antagonist, the evil wizard Malkil.

However, the aging Malkil has gone mad, using his magic for evil, and has captured the princess as prisoner in Castle IronSpire, deep within the forests of Elrond. The brave knight Kuros, is summoned to venture through the forests of Elrond. He is armed with the legendary Brightsword, a sword that is powerful enough to beat demons, insects, undead, and the other creatures under Malkil's spell.<ref>[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], p. 2.</ref> With the sword, he ventures out through the forests of Elrond and the various caves and tunnels and to Castle IronSpire, to defeat Malkil and rescue the princess.<ref>[[#manual|Instruction Manual]], p. 5.</ref>

Arnie Katz reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', stating that "''Wizards & Warriors'' refutes the claim that all video games are unrestrained target shoots. This engaging and well-programmed action quest offers a satisfying, well-rounded gaming experience."<ref name="CGW49">{{cite magazine |last=Katz |first=Arnie |title=Video Gaming World |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=July 1988 |volume=1 |issue=49 |pages=44–45}}</ref>

In a retrospective of the entire ''Wizards & Warriors'' series, UK-based magazine ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' gave a positive review of the first game, saying that "Kuros's first adventure was a unique experience for NES gamers in 1987, and technically well ahead of other games for the console at the time." The review said that the platform game emphasizes hunting treasure and items, and that most gamers disliked the relatively easy difficulty level due to unlimited continues. According to the retrospective, in 1988, Rare showed ''Wizards & Warriors'' to Zippo Games, who was touring Rare and its NES library. Rare asked Zippo to develop a sequel, which became ''[[Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors&nbsp;II]]''.<ref name="RG" /> In another retrospective at Rare's 25th anniversary, ''[[GamePro]]'' called the game "unique at the time" due to unlimited continues.<ref name="GamePro" />

''Wizards & Warriors'' has received scant coverage from modern video gaming websites. [[GamesRadar]] named the opening theme "Game music of the day", noting that the theme "suggests, from the moment you turn on the game, that knights, wizards, goblins and who knows what else are about to collide in a battle so epic it's destined for a [[Frank Frazetta|Frazetta]] painting".<ref name="GamesRadar" /> JC Fletcher from [[Joystiq]] called the game "a simple action-platformer about a guy in thick armor who kicks open treasure chests in order to bribe knights". He notes the variety of good and bad items such as the "Staff of Power" which inflicts much damage to enemies and conversely the "Cloak of Darkness", which he says "makes Kuros invisible to ''you'' but not to enemies". He said that the game has an arcade feel, with unlimited continues, a high-score list, name entry for high scores, and good music.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=JC |title=Virtually Overlooked: ''Wizards & Warriors'' |publisher=Joystiq |date=June 12, 2008 |access-date=February 4, 2011 |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/06/12/virtually-overlooked-wizards-and-warriors/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019012307/http://www.joystiq.com/2008/06/12/virtually-overlooked-wizards-and-warriors/ |archive-date=October 19, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> ''[[Houston Press]]''{{'}}s Jef Rouner lauded the game's music and animation, and noted its high difficulty level, especially during boss battles.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rouner |first=Jef |title=Top 10 NES Games We're Buying This Year |newspaper=[[Houston Press]] |date=December 6, 2011 |access-date=January 2, 2012 |url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/artattack/2011/12/top_10_nes_games_were_buying_t.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110105959/http://blogs.houstonpress.com/artattack/2011/12/top_10_nes_games_were_buying_t.php |archive-date=January 10, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[IGN]] put ''Wizards & Warriors'' at #56 on its "Top 100 NES Games" list, and reviewer Sam Claiborn said that the game was inspired by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' style of RPGs, and added action platforming elements.<ref>{{cite web |last=Claiborn |first=Sam |title=56.
