'''''Spy Hunter II''''' is an [[arcade game]] released by [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]] in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] as sequel to 1983's ''[[Spy Hunter]]''. Unlike its popular predecessor, ''Spy Hunter II'' was not ported to any contemporary systems and remained obscure. George Gomez, who designed the original, was critical of the sequel made by the studio without his involvement.<ref name=Ellis>{{cite web|url=http://www.liketotally80s.com/2012/10/spy-hunter/|title=Chat with Spy Hunter Game Designer|author=Dave Ellis|date=October 2, 2012|publisher=Like Totally 80s}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is similar to the original ''Spy Hunter'' but takes place in a 3D overhead behind the car view. The player can obtain several weapons just like in the original Spy hunter such as oil slicks, missiles and smoke screen. The game also includes a two player co-operative mode where the players can help each other out. The arcade cabinet uses a single monitor divided by a [[bezel (screen)|bezel]] and two steering wheels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9743 |title=Spy Hunter II at the Killer List of Video Games |publisher=Arcade-museum.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-04}}</ref> Both the cabinet and in-game design were previously seen in Bally Midway's ''Max RPM'', released the year before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8644 |title=Max RPM at the Killer List of Video Games |publisher=Arcade-museum.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-04}}</ref>
