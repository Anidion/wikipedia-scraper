{{nihongo|'''''Super Boy Allan'''''|スーパーボーイ・アラン|Sūpā Bōi Aran}} is an [[educational video game]] developed by [[Asmik Corporation]] for the [[Family Computer Disk System]], and published by [[Sunsoft]] in 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/famicomds/578394-super-boy-allan|title = Super Boy Allan for Famicom Disk System - GameFAQs}}</ref>

''Super Boy Allan'' is the second installment in Sunsoft and Asmik's Intelligence Game trilogy. It is preceded by ''[[Adian no Tsue]]'' (1986), and followed by ''[[Chitei Tairiku Orudora]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/super-boy-allan/3030-42272/ |title=''Super Boy Allan'' |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=[[Giant Bomb]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>

In the game, Allan Colada journeys from his home in the foothills into the mountains to retrieve a remedy for his sister Leela's fever.

==Gameplay==
To progress through most game screens, the player must push, kick, or pull logs to clear a path to the exit, as well as to solve [[arithmetic]] [[equation]]s and [[Inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] statements involving [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9017567 |title=Super Boy Allan Is Not So Super |last=Cifaldi |first=Frank |date=22 January 2010 |website=[[1Up.com]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>

The mechanics of the log-pushing puzzles are comparable to those in the ''[[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]]'' [[video game franchise]], which in turn derive from ''[[Sokoban]]'' (1982). However, by using a rope (which are in limited supply), Allan can also pull a log away. Kicking a log toward an enemy defeats the enemy.

The design of the game world is patterned on [[Nintendo]]'s [[action-adventure game]] ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
