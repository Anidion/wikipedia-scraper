''[[Sinclair User]]'': <blockquote>The first game ever to receive an "18" certificate. Very literate effort from St. Brides, with 'gore' added by CRL.<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{Citation|title=Jack the Ripper Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=January 1988}}</ref>

Zzap!64's reviewer said the game was similar in style to Rod Pike's work. They thought some of the graphics were unnecessary but the stylish text, atmosphere and excitement created made it "a must for the adventurers collection." It was given a 78% overall rating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=034&amp;page=043&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap&amp;check=1|title = Impossible to Display Scan}}</ref>
