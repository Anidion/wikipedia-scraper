{{nihongo|'''''Falsion'''''|ファルシオン|Farushion}} is an on-rail 3D [[shoot-'em-up]] produced by [[Konami]] that was released for the [[Family Computer Disk System]] in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]]. It is one of the few games compatible with the [[Famicom 3D System]] peripheral.

==Plot==
The game's background story is only explained through the [[Instruction manual (gaming)|user manual]]. In the game's universe, humanity has colonized most planets in our galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], and they now look towards expanding their reach by using an experimental travel technology called "Hyperzone Drive". However, a race of aliens who have already mastered that technology are currently invading planets at a quick pace, closing in on the [[Solar System]]. The invaders attack humanity's colony on [[Pluto]] and conquer it with little resistance, since human civilization doesn't have the technology to defend itself.

The human organization responsible for the space program, the "United Space Force", decides to use the yet-untested "Hyperzone Drive" in order to send ships that will directly attack the armies of the invading aliens. However, the new technology proves hard to control, and only one of the ships manages to survive the trip: the protagonist's ship, named ''Falsion''. The story of the game itself deals with the ''Falsion'''s attack on the alien forces, and its eventual victory over the alien [[mothership]], called "Gigantos", which serves as the game's [[Boss (video gaming)#Final boss|final boss]].

==Gameplay==
The game is a [[shoot 'em up]] in which the player controls the movements of a flying [[Spacecraft|space ship]], called the ''Falsion'', while simultaneously shooting enemy ships and trying to avoid their attacks. The goal of the game is to survive to the end of the [[Scrolling|auto-scrolling]] levels and defeat the boss to move on to the next level, until the sixth and final boss is defeated.

In a manner that has been compared to games like ''[[Space Harrier]]'' and ''[[Star Fox (1993 video game)|Star Fox]]'', the player's perspective is from the [[Third-person shooter|third person]], behind the space ship, as it goes forward. Enemies, projectiles and obstacles seem to fly towards the space ship. Enemies can be attacked by shooting a rapid-firing [[beam weapon]] or [[Missile guidance|homing missiles]], although there is a limited supply of the latter. Randomly appearing [[power-ups]] which float around the screen for a limited time can also be collected by the player, and they either increase the ship's movement speed or replenish its missile supply. To survive, the player must avoid getting hit by enemies and obstacles or their attacks. The player can also destroy these enemies, which include other space ships, meteorites and robots.

==Reception and legacy==
The game received mixed reviews. Atari HQ praised ''Falsion'''s fluidity and called its 3D mode a great experience, saying the game is a "must-get".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://atarihq.com/tsr/fds/falsion.html|title= Falsion |date= 1999|website= Atari HQ|access-date=September 11, 2013}}</ref> Another reviewer found the depth perception confusing and while they praised the game's music and said this was the best [[Famicom 3D System]] title, it remained "a pain to play".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/konamishooters/konamishooters6.htm|title= Famicon/SNES Shooters|website= Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date= 2013-09-11|archive-date= 2017-06-15|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222806/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/konamishooters/konamishooters6.htm|url-status= dead}}</ref>

Despite the similarity in name, the "Falchion β" ship in ''[[Gradius Gaiden]]'' is not based on the "Falsion" ship featured in this game.<ref>{{cite book|author=Isobe Keichii|script-title=ja:グラディウス ポータブル 公式ガイド ~レジェンド オブ I・II・III・IV・外伝~|trans-title=Gradius Portable Official Guide|date=9 March 2006|publisher=[[Konami]]|url=http://shmuplations.com/gpg-gradiusgaiden/|isbn=4-86155-111-0|access-date=10 January 2018|language=ja|quote=By the way, regarding the Falchion β… after we completed Gradius Gaiden, I learned of the existence of the FDS game Falsion.
