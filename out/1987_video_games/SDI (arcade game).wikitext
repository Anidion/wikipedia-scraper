'''''SDI - Strategic Defense Initiative''''', or simply titled '''''SDI''''' and sometimes known as '''''Global Defense''''', is a [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] [[scrolling shooter|horizontally scrolling shooter]] produced and released internationally in arcades by [[Sega]]. It was later ported to [[home computers]] and [[game consoles]], some by other companies. Players control a [[satellite]] and must destroy enemies by moving a [[crosshair]] over them and firing the satellite's weapons.

==Gameplay==
Players control a [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] satellite orbiting the Earth and must destroy enemy missiles/satellites with its weapons, and when activated the satellite's weapon systems fire at the [[crosshair]] present onscreen during play. The arcade version features a [[joystick]] to control the satellite and a [[trackball]] to control the crosshair. Home computer versions use different control schemes, such as depressing the fire button to control the crosshair, alternating between controlling the satellite and its weapons.<ref name="zzap">{{cite journal | last = Hamza| first = Kati |author2=Evans, Matthew | title = SDI| journal = [[Zzap!64]]| issue = 47| pages = 21| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications Ltd]]| date = March 1989}}</ref> It is also possible to use a [[joystick]] and mouse in combination to control the satellite and crosshair at the same time, emulating the arcade game's controls.<ref name="cvg">{{cite journal | last = Rignall| first = Julian | title = Reviews - SDI| journal = [[Computer and Video Games]]| issue = 86| pages = 58, 59| publisher = [[EMAP]]| date = December 1988}}</ref>

Each stage is split into two sections: offensive mode and defensive mode. During offensive mode, the player engages a number of enemies with the aim of destroying them all without the satellite being destroyed by the enemy. Should the player destroy all enemies during offensive mode, they are awarded 20,000 bonus points and begin the next stage on the offensive. If any enemies evade destruction during offensive mode, the player must complete defensive mode, where they are tasked with protecting the homeland from incoming warheads. Completion of defensive mode advances the player to the next stage, where they go on the offensive again.

===Etymology===
The real ''Strategic Defense Initiative'' was colloquially known as the ''Star Wars program'' and proposed by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] in 1983 to promote defensive weaponry that could shoot ICBMs out of space.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reviews - SDI| journal = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| issue = 90| pages = 49| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications Ltd]]| date = July 1991}}</ref>

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''SDI'' on their June 1, 1987 issue as being the sixth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=309|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 June 1987|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>
