{{nihongo foot|'''''Fantasy Zone II: The Tears of Opa-Opa'''''|ファンタジーゾーンII オパオパの涙|Fantajī Zōn tsū: Opa-Opa no Namida|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] for the [[Master System]] published by [[Sega]] in 1987. It was ported to the [[arcade video game|arcade]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]], and [[MSX|MSX2]], and was remade for the [[System 16]] hardware on a [[PlayStation 2]] compilation in 2008. It was re-released on the [[Wii]] Virtual Console in North America on June 29, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=It's No Reel Fantasy: Water, Sudoku and Silver Stars Can Boost Your Skills|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/eLGX55f2caZ6Zt9OYDeVJoGLwZhw7OlD|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=2009-06-29|accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref> Like the first ''[[Fantasy Zone]]'', the player controls a sentient spaceship named Opa-opa who fights surreal invader enemies. Like its predecessor, ''Fantasy Zone II'' departs from scrolling shooter themes with its bright colors and whimsical designs. For this reason, it is occasionally dubbed a "cute 'em up".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5030582/sega-whips-up-a-complete-fantasy-zone-collection|title = Sega Whips up a Complete Fantasy Zone Collection| date=29 July 2008}}</ref>

==Plot==
In the past, the courageous hero Opa-Opa saved the Fantasy Zone from the invading Menon forces, but his victory came at a price as he was forced to fight his own father who led the invasion. It is now Space Year 1432, 10 years after that battle, and the Nenon forces are spreading chaos through the Fantasy Zone. Opa-Opa must once again fly into the Fantasy Zone to rout the invasion.

At the end of the game, Opa-Opa comes face-to-face with the invasion's mastermind: an identical copy of himself. After a tense battle, Opa-Opa's father appears to confront them, and the sight of him brings Opa-Opa to tears which causes the second Opa-Opa to vanish. It is later revealed that this twin is a physical manifestation of Opa-Opa's dark impulses and desires, spawned from a war that took place during his childhood, and seeking to drive the Fantasy Zone into ruin. Reunited with his father, Opa-Opa is able to purge this darkness from himself and swears that such a disaster will never occur again.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Fantasy Zone II Screenshot.png|left|thumb|Screenshot]]

Similar to ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]'', the player occupies a side-scrolling level that repeats indefinitely, and in which the player can freely travel left or right.<ref name="wii ign">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080420101653/http://wii.ign.com/articles/866/866238p1.html IGN]</ref><ref name="hg101">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/fantasyzone/fantasyzone.htm|title=Fantasy Zone – Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref><ref>[http://retro.ign.com/articles/915/915442p1.html IGN]</ref> Each zone contains several "bases" that serve as primary targets. New to the sequel are "warps" hidden behind certain bases that allow the player to travel between different zones. Each level has at least three zones, and when all of the bases have been cleared in all of the zones of a level, the player can travel through the warp to the [[Boss (video games)|boss]].<ref name="wii ign" /><ref name="hg101" />

Boss fights do not allow for free travel as the main stages do, and force the player to face the boss or face a particular direction. Bosses are generally very large and change color to reflect damage taken. The final stage is a "boss rush" in which the player must fight a succession of previous bosses before fighting the final boss.<ref name="gamefaqs">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/file/579375/32333 |title=GameFAQs: Fantasy Zone 2 (NES) FAQ/Walkthrough by Thunderbird |website=www.gamefaqs.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330090257/http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/file/579375/32333 |archive-date=2010-03-30}}</ref>

There are two action buttons that correspond to two types of attacks, "fire" and "bomb". The fire attacks shoot horizontally, as in a typical shooter,<ref>''Fantasy Zone II'' instruction manual, p. 2, SEGA, 1987</ref> and different variants can be purchased at shops. The bomb attacks are more powerful, and the basic bomb drops downward. Other variants have other behaviors and are limited in quantity.<ref name="gamefaqs" />

Shops, uncovered at key points, allow the player to purchase upgraded weapons, bombs, and speed, as well as extra lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/msx/fantasy-zone-ii-the-tears-of-opa-opa |title=Fantasy Zone II: The Tears of Opa-Opa for MSX - MobyGames |access-date=2009-02-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105151647/http://www.mobygames.com/game/msx/fantasy-zone-ii-the-tears-of-opa-opa |archive-date=2009-01-05}}</ref> Upgrades to Opa-Opa's speed (such as larger wings, or jet engines) are permanent as long as the player does not lose a life, but weapon upgrades are time-limited, and bombs limited in quantity. Items become increasingly expensive with subsequent purchases, encouraging the player to vary their purchases.<ref name="gamefaqs" />

==Reception==
The Master System port received positive reviews. ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' scored it 88% in 1990.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Guide: Sega |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=November 1990 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles: Volume IV |pages=89–110 |url=https://archive.org/details/Complete_Guide_to_Consoles_Volume_IV_1990_EMAP_Publishing_GB/page/n88}}</ref> ''[[Console XS]]'' scored it 90% score in 1992.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Software A-Z: Master System |magazine=[[Console XS]] |date=23 April 1992 |issue=1 (June/July 1992) |publisher=[[Paragon Publishing]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=137–47 |url=https://archive.org/details/console-xs-01/page/137}}</ref>

==Ports==
The arcade version of ''Fantasy Zone II'' is based on the System E board, and as a result, is almost identical to the Master System version. Differences include the use of the radar that shows which bases are destroyed or not, as well as the use of a timer that, when it reaches zero, the player will lose a life. If the player manages to clear a level, the timer's remaining seconds will add to the score and money.

Unlike the original version, the Famicom port's subtitle on the title screen says ''The Teardrop of Opa-opa''.

==System 16 remake==
[[File:ARC Fantasy Zone II - The Tears of Opa-Opa.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of ''Fantasy Zone II: The Tears of Opa-Opa'' (System 16 version)]]

In September 2008, Sega released a [[Video game remake|remake]] of ''Fantasy Zone II'', as part of the compilation ''[[Sega Ages]] Vol. 33 Fantasy Zone Complete Collection''. Developed by [[M2 (game developer)|M2]], the game is unique from most remakes in that it is not an attempt to modernize an older work, but rather a ground-up reimagining of the title as arcade game on [[System 16]] hardware like its predecessor, rather than a console title for the more limited [[Master System]].<ref name="sega jp">{{Cite web|url=http://ages.sega.jp/vol33/fz2r.html|title = SEGA AGES 2500 シリーズ Vol.33 ファンタジーゾーン コンプリートコレクション}}</ref> It has been described as a "[[Counterfactual history|What If]]" remake,<ref name="sega jp" /><ref>''Fantasy Zone Complete Collection'' back cover</ref> and strictly adheres to the technical limitations of the time in which ''Fantasy Zone II'' was originally released.<ref name="sega jp" />

M2 CEO Naoki Horii has stated that the remake was inspired by his disappointment that ''Fantasy Zone'' never got a true arcade sequel: "I played the SMS game a lot, but in my heart of hearts, I really wanted to see it on arcade hardware."<ref name="M2 Complete">Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/jc5DlOkOcU4 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20190519140900/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc5DlOkOcU4&gl=US&hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite AV media | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc5DlOkOcU4 | title = M2: Complete Works / MY LIFE IN GAMING | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> To ensure the remake would be authentic to the System 16's unique hardware capabilities and limitations, M2 developed the title on real System 16 hardware, with a modest memory increase to 256&nbsp;KB, which M2 dubbed System 16C,<ref>''Sega Ages 2500 Vol 33 Fantasy Zone Complete Collection'' instruction manual, p. 7, SEGA, 2008</ref> and is playable in the compilation via the company's [[emulator|emulation]] technology. It shows a 1987 SEGA copyright, makes no mention of M2, and bears no titular distinction from the original game. Because of this it can be easily confused for a real arcade title from 1987. Fans have dubbed this version ''Fantasy Zone II DX'' to distinguish it from the original versions.<ref>[http://ps2.ign.com/objects/857/857910.html IGN]</ref> This remake was beyond the scope of features requested by Sega and the available budget, so Horii funded development out-of-pocket for an amount he described as "about the cost of a new car".<ref name="M2 Complete" />

It follows the original ''Fantasy Zone II'' only very loosely, pulling enemies, music, locations, and gameplay elements from the Master System game and pairing them with completely new content and elements of the original arcade ''Fantasy Zone''. The most notable change is to the level structure. Rather than having several distinct zones in each stage that must be cleared, each stage in the remake has two parallel dimensions (Bright Side and Dark Side) of comparable size to the levels in the first ''Fantasy Zone''. Bases destroyed in one dimension will also be destroyed in the other, making it possible to clear the level entirely on one side or the other. The Dark Side is more difficult, but offers greater rewards in points and money earned. Bosses are the same on either side, but have considerably more difficult attack patterns on the dark side.<ref name="nextlevel">{{cite web| url=http://www.the-nextlevel.com/review/ps2/fantazy-zone-complete-collection/|title=Fantasy Zone Complete Collection | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213222304/http://www.the-nextlevel.com/review/ps2/fantazy-zone-complete-collection/ | archive-date=2012-02-13}}</ref> The game also features three endings, which depend on both whether the Dark Side levels were cleared and whether some specific items were bought.

The music, arranged by [[Manabu Namiki]], uses melodies of many songs from Tokuhiko Uwabo's original ''Fantasy Zone II'' soundtrack, but is calculatedly rearranged in a style more similar to that of the original ''Fantasy Zone'''s composer, [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (composer)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]].<ref name="nextlevel" /> Namiki also wrote original tracks for the game. Stages and enemies are largely based on themes from the original, but some are difficult to recognize. Only about half of the game's bosses correspond to those in the original. It is generally regarded as a very loose interpretation of the original.<ref name="nextlevel" />

M2 released a free demo of their version of ''Fantasy Zone II'' on their website that lets the user download and play the first and second levels on a [[Windows]] computer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtwo.co.jp/fz2trial/|title = System16版 Fantasy Zone Ii 体験版}}</ref>

The game was bootlegged and released to the arcades under the title ''FZ-2006 II'' by Taiwanese manufacturer ISG.<ref name="Arcade History">{{Cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=fz-2006-ii-the-tears-of-opa-opa&page=detail&id=36300|title = FZ 2006 II: The Tears of Opa-Opa, Arcade Video game by ISG (2009)}}</ref> The bootleg bears a 2006 copyright date but actually appears to be derived from the 2008 PlayStation 2 release due to it containing the same "2008-07-15VER" string embedded in the ROM data. Sega also produced a limited number of arcade units running real System 16 hardware to promote the game's release.

A [[Nintendo 3DS]] port of this 16-bit version of ''Fantasy Zone II'' was released in Japan in 2014 and internationally in 2015. Titled ''3D Fantasy Zone II W'', it includes new features, content, and a second game mode called Link Loop Land, an endless survival mode starring Opa-Opa's brother, Upa-Upa.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archives.sega.jp/3d/fz/index.html |title=3D ファンタジーゾーン オパオパブラザーズ ｜セガ 3D復刻プロジェクト |access-date=2014-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713063754/http://archives.sega.jp/3d/fz/index.html |archive-date=2014-07-13 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It is also included in ''[[Sega 3D Classics Collection]]''.
