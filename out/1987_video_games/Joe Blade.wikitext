==Reception==
Ron Stewart for ''[[Page 6]]'' said "It is not a great game, but for under a tenner what do you expect. There is enough game play here to keep you going for a while."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Page6-33-May88/page/46/mode/2up|title=Page6 33 May88|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Arnie Katz & Joyce Worley for ''[[Ahoy!]]'s AmigaUser'' said "''Joe Blade'' is an exceptionally well programmed product.
