==Development==
''Star Wreck'' was written using the [[Graphic Adventure Creator]]. After its initial publication in 1987, it also appeared in Alternative Software's compilation tape ''4-Most Adventures'', in 1991.<ref>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0011180 ''4-Most Adventures''] at World of Spectrum</ref>

==Reception==
''Star Wreck'' was reviewed by ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' in December 1987,<ref>[http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/starwreck.htm ''Star Wreck'' review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528140826/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/starwreck.htm# |date=2006-05-28 }} from Your Sinclair issue 24, December 1987; retrieved from The Your Sinclair Rock 'n' Roll Years</ref> receiving 6 out of 10. Whilst enjoyable, the reviewer felt that the initial area (the Starship ''Paralysed'') was too open, causing difficulties in working out what's going on.
