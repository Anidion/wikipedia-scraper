''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' in 1988 stated "I loved the original version of this game and I love this sequel," citing its "simple and hypnotic" game play, user interface with both simple and complex options, and lack of [[copy protection]].<ref name="panak198805">{{Cite magazine |last=Panak |first=Steve |date=May 1988 |title=New ST Entertainments / From dungeons to outer space |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v7n1/newstentertainment.html |magazine=Antic |volume=7 |issue=1}}</ref> In the 1992 and 1994 surveys ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave the title two-plus stars of five, calling it "Quite entertaining when originally released, but its graphics have rendered it obsolescent".<ref name="brooks199211">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100 | title=Strategy & Wargames: The Future (2000-....) | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1992 | accessdate=4 July 2014 | author=Brooks, M.

Robbie Robberson reviewed ''Roadwar Europa'' in ''[[The Space Gamer|Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]'' No. 81.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Robberson |first=Robbie |date=1987|title=Mad Max' USA / European Tour|journal=[[The Space Gamer|Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]|publisher=[[Diverse Talents, Incorporated]]|issue=81|pages=42–43}}</ref> Robberson commented that "In short, the ''Roadwar'' series is an example of a good idea that is short circuited by its components. If Strategic Simulations, Inc. can release these games with a better and quicker combat routine, or better yet, reduce the incidence of combat, these games would be a required addition to every serious computer gamer's library. As of now, they are simply entertaining in the short run, and tedious in the long."<ref name="SG"/>
