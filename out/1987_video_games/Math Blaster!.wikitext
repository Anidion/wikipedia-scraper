'''''Math Blaster!''''' is a 1983 [[educational video game]], and the first entry in the "Math Blaster" series within the ''[[Blaster Learning System]]'' created by [[Davidson & Associates]]. The game was developed by former educator Jan Davidson.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVRN2dzy_zUC&q=%22math+blaster%22+%221983%22+OR+%221984%22+OR+%221985%22&pg=PA36|title=Engineering Play: A Cultural History of Children's Software|last=Ito|first=Mizuko|date=2012-02-10|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-29155-2|language=en}}</ref> It would be revised and ported to newer hardware and operating systems, with enhanced versions rebranded as '''''Math Blaster Plus!''''' (1987), followed by '''''New Math Blaster Plus!''''' (1990). A full redesign was done in 1993 as ''[[Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot]]'' and again in 1996 as ''Mega Math Blaster''.

The game spawned other Math Blaster titles like ''Math Blaster Jr.'' and ''[[Math Blaster Mystery: The Great Brain Robbery]]'', as well as math-related spin-offs like ''Alge Blaster'' and ''Geometry Blaster'', and forays into other subjects like ''Reading Blaster'', ''Word Blaster'', ''Spelling Blaster'', and ''Science Blaster Jr.''

== Gameplay ==
An arcade-style educational game that offers skill-building mathematical exercises, the title contains minigames that test players' knowledge in subjects such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, percentages, and decimals. A series of mathematics problems appear on the screen, and the player must move to fire the cannon pointing at the correct answer. The game included an editor for teachers and parents to design their own problems.

While this title was purely a drill and practice, its 1987 sequel would wrap the activity around a narrative.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ge8qDQAAQBAJ&q=%22math+blaster%21%22&pg=PA193|title=Choosing and Using Digital Games in the Classroom: A Practical Guide|last=Becker|first=Katrin|date=2016-10-04|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-12223-6|language=en}}</ref>

== Educational goals ==
''Math Blaster'' was designed to aid students to master first-to-sixth-grade mathematics in an exciting and interesting manner. The learning activities were advertised as graphically appealing and promised to motivate and challenge students.<ref name=MB-AtariBox/>

The game, plus its various sequels and spin-offs, has since become the best-selling piece of math software in history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVRN2dzy_zUC&q=%22math+blaster%22+%221983%22+OR+%221984%22+OR+%221985%22&pg=PA36|title=Engineering Play: A Cultural History of Children's Software|last=Ito|first=Mizuko|date=2012-02-10|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-29155-2|language=en}}</ref>
