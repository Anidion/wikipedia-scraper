{{nihongo foot|'''''Quester'''''|クエスター|Kuesutā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1987 [[Breakout clone|block breaker]] [[arcade game]] developed and published in Japan by [[Namco]]. Controlling a paddle-like craft, the player is tasked with clearing each stage by deflecting a ball towards a formation of bricks towards the top of the screen. Power-up items are hidden in some blocks, which can increase the size of the player's paddle, a barrier that prevents the ball from moving off the screen, and a forcefield that will release eight other balls when touched.

The game was produced by [[Toru Iwatani]], known as the creator of ''[[Pac-Man]]''. It was created as a response to [[Taito]]'s 1986 arcade title ''[[Arkanoid]]'', which helped revive the block breaker genre and inspire waves of its own clone games. A special version of the game was released shortly after the original's release, ''Quester: Special Edition'', featuring levels designed by readers of Namco's press literature. It was released to the Japanese [[Wii Virtual Console]] in 2009, where it was renamed to '''''Namco Quester'''''.

''Quester'' is a block breaker video game, often compared to Taito's ''Arkanoid''. Using a rotary knob, the player controls a paddle-like craft fixed at the bottom of the screen, the objective being to deflect a ball towards a large formation of bricks in each round.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web |title=Quester |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9197 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |access-date=6 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325041323/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9197 |archive-date=25 March 2019}}</ref> A life is lost when the player misses the ball and it falls of-screen. Some blocks contain power-up items that can help the player in the stage, such as increasing the width of the paddle, place a barrier at the bottom of the screen to prevent the ball from being lost, and a forcefield that will spit out eight other balls if touched. Some stages contain "killer meteors", which can decrease the paddle's size if touched.<ref name="Gamest 11/87"/>

Alongside regular colored bricks, other block types include indestructible bricks, blocks that can speed up and slow down the ball when touched, and "generator blocks" that produce an endless number of red blocks. Some stages are based on other Namco video game characters, including a ''[[Galaxian]]'' flagship, [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], and a Rainbow Block from ''[[Cutie Q]]''.<ref name="Gamest 11/87">{{cite book |last1=Yamakawa |first1=Mari |title=クエスター |date=November 1987 |publisher=[[Gamest]] |page=88}}</ref> The 33rd round of the game features a boss fight with a large mechanical fortress named "Breeder", which can be destroyed by deflecting the ball against its large metal shield.<ref name="Gamest 11/87"/> Collecting a Special Flag from ''[[Rally-X]]'' will award the player an extra life.<ref name="Gamest 11/87"/>
