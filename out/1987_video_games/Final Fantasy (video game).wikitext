{{nihongo foot|'''''Final Fantasy'''''|ファイナルファンタジー|Fainaru Fantajī|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha <!-- See [[WP:JFN]] -->}} is a fantasy [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] in 1987. It is the first game in Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, created by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]]. Originally released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], ''Final Fantasy'' was [[video game remake|remade]] for several [[video game console]]s and is frequently packaged with ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' in video game collections. The first ''Final Fantasy'' story follows four youths called the Warriors of Light, who each carry one of their world's four [[classical element|elemental]] crystals which have been darkened by [[Chaos (Final Fantasy character)|the four Elemental Fiends]]. Together, they quest to defeat these evil forces, restore light to the crystals, and save their world.

''Final Fantasy'' was originally conceived under the working title ''Fighting Fantasy'', but trademark issues and dire circumstances surrounding Square as well as Sakaguchi himself prompted the name to be changed. The game was a great commercial success, received generally positive reviews, and spawned many successful sequels and supplementary titles in the form of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. The original is now regarded as one of the most influential and successful role-playing games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, playing a major role in popularizing the genre. Critical praise focused on the game's graphics, while criticism targeted the time spent wandering in search of [[random encounter|random battle encounters]] to raise the player's experience level. By March 2003, all versions of ''Final Fantasy'' had sold a combined two million copies worldwide.

==Gameplay==
''Final Fantasy'' has four basic game modes: an [[overworld]] map, town and dungeon maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. The primary means of travel across the overworld is by foot; a ship, a canoe, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]], enemies are [[random encounter|randomly encountered]] on field maps and on the overworld map when traveling by foot, canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.<ref name="basicinfo4">{{cite book|year=1989|title=Final Fantasy Explorer's Handbook (instruction manual)|publisher=[[Square (video game company)|Square]]|id=NES-FF-USA}}</ref>

[[File:Final Fantasy I Lich Battle.png|thumb|left|The Light Warriors battle [[Lich]], Fiend of Earth|alt=Commands to give the character are shown.]]

The game's plot develops as the player progresses through towns and dungeons. Some town citizens offer helpful information, while others own shops that sell items or equipment. Dungeons appear in areas that include forests, caves, mountains, swamps, underwater caverns, and buildings. Dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. The game's menu screen allows the player to keep track of their [[experience point]]s and levels, to choose which equipment their characters wield, and to use items and magic. A character's most basic attribute is their level, which can range from one to fifty, and is determined by the character's amount of experience. Gaining a level increases the character's attributes, such as their maximum [[health (gaming)|hit points]] (HP), which represents a character's remaining health; a character dies when they reach zero HP. Characters gain experience points by winning battles.<ref name="basicinfo4"/>

Combat in ''Final Fantasy'' is menu-based: the player selects an action from a list of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and continue until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain not only experience but also money, which is known as Gil in the ''Final Fantasy'' universe; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost.<ref name="basicinfo4"/> ''Final Fantasy'' was the first game to show the player's characters on the right side of the screen and the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a [[First-person (video games)|first-person view]].<ref name="FFI"/>

The player begins the game by choosing four characters to form a party and is locked into that choice for the duration of the game.<ref name="basicinfo"/> Each character has an "occupation", or [[character class]], with different attributes and abilities that are either innate or can be acquired.<ref name="basicinfo">{{cite book|year=1989|title=Final Fantasy Explorer's Handbook (instruction manual)|page=80| publisher=[[Square (video game company)|Square]]|id=NES-FF-USA}}</ref> There are six classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, Red Mage, White Mage, and Black Mage.<ref name="basicinfo"/> Later in the game, the player has the option to have each character undergo a "class upgrade"; whereby their [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] portraits mature, and some classes gain the ability to use weapons and magic that they previously could not use.<ref name="basicinfo4"/> The game contains a variety of weapons, armor, and items that can be bought or found to make the characters more powerful in combat. Each character has eight inventory slots, with four to hold weapons and four to hold armor. Each character class has restrictions on what weapons and armor it may use. Some weapons and armor are magical; if used during combat, they will cast spells. Other magical artifacts provide protection, such as from certain spells. At shops, the characters can buy items to help themselves recover while they are traveling. Items available include potions, which heal the characters or remove ailments like poison or petrification; Tents and Cabins, which can be used on the world map to heal the player and optionally save the game; and Houses, which also recover the party's magic after saving. Special items may be gained by doing [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]].<ref name="basicinfo4"/>

Magic is a common ability in the game, and several character classes use it. Spells are divided into two groups: White, which is defensive and healing, and Black, which is debilitating and destructive. Magic can be bought from White and Black magic shops and assigned to characters whose occupation allows them to use it. Spells are classified by a level between one and eight, with four White and four Black spells per level. Each character may learn only three spells per level. White and Black Mages can potentially learn any of their respective spells, while Red Mages, the Ninja, and the Knight cannot use most high-level magic.<ref name="basicinfo4"/>

==Plot==
===Setting===
''Final Fantasy'' takes place in a fantasy world with three large continents. The elemental powers of this world are determined by the state of four crystals, each governing one of the four [[classical element]]s: earth, fire, water, and wind. The world of ''Final Fantasy'' is inhabited by numerous races, including humans, elves, dwarves, mermaids, dragons, and robots. Most non-human races have only one "town" in the game, although individuals are sometimes found in human towns or other areas as well. Four hundred years prior to the start of the game, the Lefeinish people, who used the Power of Wind to craft airships and a giant [[space station]] (called the Floating Castle in the game), watched their country decline as the Wind crystal went dark. Two hundred years later, violent storms sank a massive shrine that served as the center of an ocean-based civilization, and the Water crystal went dark. The Earth crystal and the Fire crystal followed, plaguing the earth with raging wildfires, and devastating the agricultural town of Melmond as the plains and vegetation decayed. Some time later, the sage Lukahn tells of a prophecy that four Light Warriors will come to save the world in a time of darkness.

===Story===
The game begins with the appearance of the four youthful Warriors of Light, the heroes of the story, who each carry one of the darkened Orbs. Initially, the Warriors of Light have access to the Kingdom of Coneria and the ruined Temple of Fiends. After the Warriors rescue Princess Sarah from the evil knight Garland, the King of Coneria builds a bridge that enables the Warriors of Light passage east to the town of Pravoka. There the Warriors of Light liberate the town from Bikke and his band of pirates and acquire the pirates' ship for their own use. The Warriors now embark on a chain of delivery quests on the shores of the Aldi Sea. First, they retrieve a stolen crown from the Marsh Cave for a king in a ruined castle, who turns out to be the dark elf Astos. Defeating him gains them the Crystal Eye, which they return to the blind witch Matoya in exchange for a herb needed to awaken the elf prince cursed by Astos. The elf prince gives the Warriors of Light the Mystic Key, which is capable of unlocking any door. The key unlocks a storage room in Coneria Castle which holds [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. Nerrick, one of the dwarves of the Cave of Dwarf/Dwarf Village, destroys a small [[isthmus]] using the TNT, connecting the Aldi Sea to the outside world.<ref name="FFI"/>

After visiting the near-ruined town of Melmond, the Warriors of Light go to the Earth Cave to defeat a vampire and retrieve the Star Ruby, which gains passage to Sage Sarda's cave. With Sarda's Rod, the Warriors venture deeper into the Earth Cave and destroy the Earth Fiend, [[Lich]]. The Warriors of Light then obtain a canoe and enter Gurgu Volcano and defeat the Fire Fiend, [[Marilith|Kary]]. The Levistone from the nearby Ice Cave allows them to raise an airship to reach the northern continents. After they prove their courage by retrieving the Rat's Tail from the Castle of Ordeal, the King of the Dragons, [[Bahamut (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bahamut]], promotes each Warrior of Light. A kind gesture is repaid by a fairy, receiving special liquid that produces oxygen, and the Warriors use it to help defeat the Water Fiend, [[Kraken]], in the Sunken Shrine. They also recover a Slab, which allows a linguist named Dr. Unne to teach them the Lefeinish language. The Lefeinish give the Warriors of Light access to the Floating Castle that [[Tiamat]], the Wind Fiend, has taken over.<ref name="FFI"/> With the [[Four Fiends]] defeated and the Orbs restored, the Warriors open a portal in the Temple of Fiends, which takes them 2000 years into the past, to confront the creator of the Fiends. There the Warriors discover that the Four Fiends sent Garland—now the archdemon Chaos—back in time and he sent the Fiends to the future to do so, creating a [[Predestination paradox|time loop]] by which he could live forever.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Final Fantasy |developer=[[Square (video game company)|Square]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=July 12, 1990 |platform=[[Nintendo Entertainment System]] |quote='''Garland:''' Remember me, Garland? Your puny lot thought it had defeated me. But, the Four FIENDS sent me back 2000 years into the past. / From here I sent the Four FIENDS to the future. The FIENDS will send me back to here, and the Time-Loop will go on. / After 2000 years, I will be forgotten, and the Time-Loop will close. I will live forever, and you shall meet doom!!}}</ref> The Warriors of Light defeat Chaos, thus ending the loop, and return to present, but their heroic deeds remain unknown outside of legend.<ref name="FFI"/>

[[File:Hironobu Sakaguchi 20070706 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|left|Hironobu Sakaguchi at Japan Expo Paris in 2007|alt=A man sitting in a chair and speaking into a microphone.]]

===Creation===
[[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] had intended to make a role-playing game (RPG) for a long time, but his employer [[Square (video game company)|Square]] refused to give him permission as it expected low sales of such a product.<ref name="Kawazu 1UP" /> However, when the RPG ''[[Dragon Quest (video game)|Dragon Quest]]'' was released and proved to be a hit in Japan, the company reconsidered its stance on the genre and approved Sakaguchi's vision of an RPG inspired by ''[[Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness|Ultima]]'' and ''[[Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord|Wizardry]]''.<ref name="Kawazu 1UP" /> Only three of his colleagues volunteered to join this project headed by him because he was thought of as a "rough boss" in spite of his unsuccessful creations.<ref name="Sakaguchi 1UP" /> Eventually, ''Final Fantasy'' was developed by a team of seven core staff members within [[Square (video game company)|Square]] referred to as the "A-Team".<ref name="developmentFF" /><ref name="nescredits">{{cite video game |title=Final Fantasy |developer=[[Square (video game company)|Square]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=July 12, 1990 |platform=[[Nintendo Entertainment System]] |scene=opening staff credits}}</ref> Sakaguchi convinced fellow game designers [[Koichi Ishii]] and [[Akitoshi Kawazu]] to join the project. Kawazu was mainly responsible for the battle system and sequences, which he based heavily on the tabletop game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and the RPG ''Wizardry''. For example, enemies' weaknesses to elements such as fire and ice had not been included in Japanese RPGs up until that point. Kawazu had grown fond of such aspects of Western RPGs and decided to incorporate them into ''Final Fantasy''. He also advocated the player's option to freely choose their own party member classes at the beginning of the game as he feels that the fun in an RPG begins when the players create a character.<ref name="Kawazu 1UP">{{cite web |author=Parish, Jeremy |date=October 15, 2012 |url=http://www.1up.com/features/deal-square-enix-akitoshi-kawazu |title=What's the Deal with Square Enix's Akitoshi Kawazu? |website=[[1UP.com]] |access-date=July 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819184025/https://retronauts.com/article/670/akitoshi-kawazu-on-the-reasoning-behind-sagas-insanity |archive-date=August 19, 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Over the years, several theories emerged as to why the game was called ''Final Fantasy''.<ref name="Uematsu Wired">{{cite magazine |author=Kohler, Chris |date=July 23, 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/07/final-fantasy/ |title=Why's It Called 'Final Fantasy'?

==Versions and re-releases==
''Final Fantasy'' has been remade several times for different platforms and has frequently been packaged with ''Final Fantasy II'' in various collections.<ref name="FFI"/> While all of these remakes retain the same basic story and battle mechanics, various changes have been made in different areas, including graphics, sound, and specific game elements.

''Final Fantasy'' was first re-released for the [[MSX2]] system and was published by [[Microcabin]] in Japan in December 1989.<ref name="msx-mag">{{cite magazine |title=新作ソフト発売スケジュール表 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  |year= 1989 |magazine=Emu Esu Ekkusu Magajin |script-work=ja:MSXマガジン |trans-work= MSX Magazine |url= https://archive.org/details/MSX_Magazine_1990-01_ASCII_JP/page/n17/mode/2up |language= Japanese |location= Japan |publisher= ASCII Corporation |page= 19 |issue = January 1990 issue |via= The Internet Archive}}</ref> It had access to almost three times as much storage space as the Famicom version but suffered from problems not present in Nintendo's cartridge media, including noticeable loading times. There were also minor graphical upgrades, improved music tracks, and sound effects.

In 1994, ''Final Fantasy I・II'', a compilation of ''Final Fantasy'' and ''Final Fantasy II'', was launched for the Famicom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-bk-49-en-70-pta.html|title=Final Fantasy I & II [pre-owned]|publisher=[[Play-Asia]]|access-date=December 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615141434/http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-bk-49-en-70-pta.html|archive-date=June 15, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> This version was only released in Japan and had very few graphical updates.

The [[WonderSwan]] Color remake was released in Japan on December 9, 2000,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jp.square-enix.com/game/detail/ff/ |title=ファイナルファンタジー |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |access-date=23 October 2023 |language=ja |trans-title=Final Fantasy |archive-date=January 18, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240118110518/https://www.jp.square-enix.com/game/detail/ff/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and featured many new graphical changes. The 8-bit graphics of the original Famicom game were updated, battle scenes incorporated full background images, and character and enemy [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] were redrawn to look more like the ones from the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] ''Final Fantasy'' games.<ref name="WSC"/>

In Japan, ''Final Fantasy'' and ''Final Fantasy II'' were re-released both separately and as a combined game for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. The collection was released in Japan in 2002 as ''[[Final Fantasy I & II Premium Package]]'' and in Europe and North America in 2003 as ''[[Final Fantasy Origins]]''.

''Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls'' is, like ''Final Fantasy Origins'', a port of the first two games in the series and was released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2004.

It retains the game difficulty and "spell level"-based magic system from the original Famicom version.

A soundtrack album was released together with the score of ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff1&2/index.html|title=All Sounds of Final Fantasy I - II|publisher=RPGFan|author1=Schweitzer, Ben|author2=Gann, Patrick|access-date=July 9, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116215146/http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff1%262/index.html|archive-date=January 16, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Some of the game's tracks became mainstays to the ''Final Fantasy'' series: the "Prelude", the [[arpeggio]] played on the title screen; the "Opening Theme", which is played when the party crosses the bridge early in the game and later referred to as the ''Final Fantasy'' theme; and the "Victory Fanfare", which is played after every victorious battle. The opening [[Motif (music)|motif]] of the battle theme has also been reused a number of times in the series.<ref name="FFI"/> ''Final Fantasy'' was also the basis for the series finale of a video game-themed cartoon series ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'' entitled "The Fractured Fantasy of Captain N".<ref>{{cite web| title=Final Fantasy Retrospective - Part X| publisher=[[GameTrailers]]| date=September 25, 2007| url=http://www.gametrailers.com/full-episodes/y25ol1/gt-retrospectives-part-x| access-date=October 16, 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009055116/http://www.gametrailers.com/full-episodes/y25ol1/gt-retrospectives-part-x| archive-date=October 9, 2012| url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[8-Bit Theater]]'', a [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]-based [[webcomic]] created by [[Brian Clevinger]], parodies the game, and has become very popular in the gaming community since it started in March 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=2&cId=3145208|title=Will Strip For Games: Gaming Comics Online|website=[[1UP.com]]|first=Nich|last=Maragos|date=November 7, 2005|access-date=December 23, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194442/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=2&cId=3145208|archive-date=September 27, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

Elements from the video game have also appeared in a series of [[fighting game]]s: ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy|Dissidia 012]]'' and ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy NT|Dissidia NT]]''. Warrior of Light, based on [[Yoshitaka Amano]]'s design of the lead character, and Garland are the respective hero and villain representing ''Final Fantasy''. Warrior of Light is voiced by [[Toshihiko Seki]] in the Japanese version and [[Grant George]] in the English version, while Garland is voiced by [[Kenji Utsumi]] (''Dissidia Final Fantasy'' and ''Dissidia 012'') and [[Kōji Ishii]] (''Dissidia NT'') in the Japanese versions and [[Christopher Sabat]] in the English versions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/dissidia-final-fantasy/previews/dissidia-final-fantasy-hands-on-6195546/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203121755/http://www.gamespot.com/dissidia-final-fantasy/previews/dissidia-final-fantasy-hands-on-6195546/|archive-date=February 3, 2012|title=Dissidia: Final Fantasy Hands-On|website=[[GameSpot]]|first=Hirohiko|last=Niizumi|date=August 6, 2008|access-date=December 23, 2008}}</ref> All the games add background information to the world of ''Final Fantasy''. For instance, ''Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy'' names the world of ''Final Fantasy'' "World A" in order to distinguish it from World B, the world of ''Dissidia''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=March 22, 2011|platform=PlayStation Portable |quote='''Report 7:''' World: A / Place: Town on the Hawk's Wing / Forgotten Memories -07- "So what you just told is all memory you have inherited?" / Yes.

Chaos and the Amano Warrior of Light make appearances as bosses in the [[Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood|''Stormblood'']] and [[Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers|''Shadowbringers'']] expansions of [[Final Fantasy XIV|''Final Fantasy XIV'']], respectively.

''[[Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin]]'', an alternate universe prequel to the original ''Final Fantasy'', contains numerous references and allusions to the original game, in addition acting as an "origin story" of the antagonist Chaos and the four Warriors of Light.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-12-21|title=Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin Producer Calls It an 'Alternate Retelling'|url=https://www.siliconera.com/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin-producer-calls-it-an-alternate-retelling/|access-date=2021-12-21|website=Siliconera|language=en-US|archive-date=January 27, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230127094419/https://www.siliconera.com/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin-producer-calls-it-an-alternate-retelling/|url-status=live}}</ref>
