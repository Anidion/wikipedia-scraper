'''''Emerald Mine''''' is a 1987 [[puzzle video game]] developed and published for [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] by [[Kingsoft GmbH|Kingsoft]]. The series follows [[mining|mines]] filled with various gems, such as emeralds. It is a ''[[Boulder Dash (video game)|Boulder Dash]]'' clone in which the player completes levels by collecting sufficient gems before reaching the exit. ''Emerald Mine'' was Kingsoft's best-selling title with reviews generally favorable, and spawned several sequels. It was also Volker Wertich's, one of the game's designers, most successful game until ''[[The Settlers (1993 video game)|The Settlers]]'' in 1993, of which he was also the creator.

==Gameplay==
''Emerald Mine'' is a [[top-down perspective|top-down]], [[tile-based video game|tile-based]] puzzle game. Similar to ''Boulder Dash'', it revolves around a character who attempts to collect enough emeralds and diamonds scattered across maze-like structures before reaching the exit, all within a time limit. The player character is immune to gravity, but objects such as stones and the aforementioned gems will fall to the ground,<ref name=CCI/> rolling to the side when the underground is loose and killing the character if one falls on him. Stones and other non-collectible objects can be pushed aside if the space next to them is empty. The player can move their character over squares of sand, digging away any in the way and creating an open space for the objects. Collectible objects and sand adjacent to the player's current position can also be removed without moving to those squares.

Some of these mazes contain enemies, including those that travel along a wall on a certain side and one kind that eats diamonds in its way. They can be killed by falling objects, one of which will explode into a diamond and up to eight emeralds. The difference between the two genstones is that a diamond is worth three emeralds and can be crushed by a falling stone, destroying it. Additionally, in some levels are [[amoeba]]e given one or a combination of properties, depending on the level: they expand across adjacent tiles of space or sand, or deadly drops fall from them. Amoebae pose a unique threat in that they can enclose the player if not managed. Other elements include colored keys to unlock doors, explosive bombs and collectible dynamite that can be used to destroy enemies and weak walls, and blue walls through which falling stones are converted into emeralds, emeralds into diamonds, and diamonds back into stones. A player scores points by collecting gemstones, crushing enemies with a boulder, cracking a nut to release an emerald, and as a bonus by having leftover time at the end of the level. ''Emerald Mine'' allows for [[cooperative video game|two players to cooperate]] and complete their objectives, with some levels designed exclusively for that mode.<ref name=HappyComputer/>

==Development==
''Emerald Mine'' was developed by Kingsoft, based in [[Aachen]]. It was designed by Klaus Heinz and Volker Wertich. Wertich would later go on to become the creator of a more successful game, the debut installment of ''The Settlers'', in 1993. This game was released for Amiga<ref name=RetroGamer>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gLaODgAAQBAJ|title=Retro Gamer Spezial|language=de|publication-place=Germany|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=February 2017|access-date=2022-08-03|issue=2/2017|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gLaODgAAQBAJ&pg=PA177 177], [https://books.google.com/books?id=gLaODgAAQBAJ&pg=PA201 201]|isbn=9783957881656 }}</ref> and Atari ST<ref name=HappyComputer/> in 1987 and ported to the [[Commodore 64]]{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} and the Commodore 16 and Plus/4 computers the next year.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/compute-mit-sh-1989-1/page/n5|title=Report – Helden, Monster, Diamanten|language=de|trans-title=Report – Heroes, Monsters, Diamonds|last=Schmidt|first=Ottfried|magazine=Compute mit|date=January 1989|access-date=2022-08-03|issue=1/1989|page=6|issn=0179-6720}}</ref>

==Sequels and legacy==
Kingsoft developed and published ''Emerald Mine 2'', the game's sequel, in 1988 with 100 new levels. A level editor was included, which triggered the creation of thousands of levels by players.<ref name="emcdawreview">Emerald Mines short review in Amiga World issue dec. 1994, p. 57, ISSN 0883-2390 [https://archive.org/stream/amiga-world-1994-12/Amiga_World_Vol_10_12_1994_Dec#page/n57 here]</ref>

In 1990, Kingsoft published a selection of levels created by players, called ''Emerald Mine 3: Professional''. It was panned by critics, citing the game being lazy, with ''[[Power Play (magazine)|Power Play]]'' magazine saying "[The third part] has been cobbled too unlovingly. No question, the game mechanics and elements are still fine invented, but they should have removed the dust layer lying on it."<ref name="em3ppreview">{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/Power.Play.N30.1990.09-kultpower/page/n39 |title=Emerald Mine 3 Professional review in Power Play |date=15 March 2014 |issue=9/1990 |page=41 |issn=0937-9754}}</ref> ''Amiga Joker'' was also highly critical of the game's presentation commenting; "There's no change on graphics and sound […], all technical details like animation and scrolling appear substantially dated."<ref name="em3ajreview">{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Joker_1990-10_Joker_Verlag_DE/page/n61 |title=Emerald Mine 3 Professional review in Amiga Joker |issue=10/1990 |page=62 |publisher=Joker Verlag |author=Borgmeier, Carsten|date=October 1990 }}</ref>

In 1994, [[Almathera]] published a collection of 14,160 levels on [[compact disk]] for the [[Amiga CD32]], titled ''Emerald Mines''. It received a better critical reception than that of ''EM3'', with ''Amiga Games'' commenting that the gameplay was as good as ever, "This Boulder Dash clone doesn't come up with spectacular graphics, but the addicting game principle and over 10,000 levels should guarantee playing fun for months."<ref name="emcdagreview">{{cite web |url=http://www.kultmags.com/Amiga%20Games/1994/Amiga%20Games%201994-11.rar |title=Emerald Mines short review in Amiga Games |issue=11/1994 |page=40 |issn=0946-6339 |access-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006075102/http://www.kultmags.com/Amiga%20Games/1994/Amiga%20Games%201994-11.rar |archive-date=6 October 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ''Amiga Joker'' also commented on the gameplay; "The game elements are in such an abundance and variants that variety is presented truly in the whole lot.
