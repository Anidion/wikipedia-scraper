==Reception==
David M. Wilson and Johnny L. Wilson reviewed ''Shirley Muldowney's Top Fuel Challenge'' with ''[[Top Fuel Eliminator]]'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Of the two games, one must - note that TFE is more user-friendly. Whereas TFC simply notes the player's failures, TFE offers a full-scale evaluation of every qualifying run."<ref name="CGW46">{{cite magazine |last1=Wilson |first1=David M. |last2=Wilson |first2=Johnny L. |title=The Boys of Spring: A Computer Sports Survey |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1988 |volume=1 |issue=46 |pages=14}}</ref>

''[[Commodore User]]'' were very critical of the game, stating the graphics were "abysmal" with "god-awful animation" and the sound "limited". Their conclusion was that the title "does succeed in being authentic in one respect. It's a real drag." It was rated 3/10.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/CommodoreUserIssue561988May/page/n31/mode/1up|title = Commodore_User_Issue_56_1988_May}}</ref>

''[[Zzap!64]]'' were similarly unimpressed, saying the 3D effect was "appalling" and the backdrops "dismal". The sound effects were said to be "feeble." Their conclusion was that it was "a slow, uninteresting and appallingly presented racing simulation". Overall score was 13%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-037/page/n29/mode/1up?view=theater|title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 037|date=May 1988}}</ref>
