'''''Action Force: International Heroes''''' is a [[video game]] released by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]], and in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]]. The game is set in the world of the [[Action Force]] ([[G.I. Joe]]) toys by [[Hasbro]]. The ZX Spectrum version of the game differs notably from the Commodore and Amstrad versions.

==Gameplay==
[[Cobra Command|Cobra]] have launched a surprise attack on the island of Botsneda. In the panic of the evacuation, classified information has been left behind in the eastern sector. An Action Force team must cross to the eastern side of the island in a modified [[A.W.E. Striker]] to retrieve the data. Their path must be safely cleared of enemies and obstacles.

The player controls a helicopter which must clear the path for the Striker and its occupants across a dangerous landscape. Rivers may be crossed by picking up pontoon sections and moving them to create [[pontoon bridge]]s.

===ZX Spectrum===
The Striker contains [[Flint (G.I. Joe)|Flint]], [[Lady Jaye]] and [[Quick Kick (G.I. Joe)|Quick Kick]], while the player controls [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]], who is equipped with a [[helipack]] and an [[automatic rifle]].<ref>Spectrum version instruction leaflet.</ref> The Striker will automatically stop when it meets an obstacle, and will begin moving again when the path is cleared. There are no enemy aircraft but missiles and aerial mines must be avoided or destroyed.

===Commodore 64/Amstrad CPC===
The Striker contains [[Lady Jaye]] and [[Crankcase (G.I. Joe)|Crankcase]], while the player controls [[Wild Bill (G.I. Joe)|Wild Bill]] and [[Flint (G.I. Joe)|Flint]] in an [[Dragonfly (G.I. Joe)|XH-1 helicopter]]. The XH-1 is equipped with missiles and bombs.<ref>Commodore 64 version instruction leaflet.</ref> The Striker will not stop when it meets an obstacle and will crash if the path is not cleared. The player must fight off hostile Cobra aircraft.

A sequel, '''''Action Force II: International Heroes''''',  was released by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] home computer.

===Gameplay===
[[Cobra Command|Cobra]] has taken a number of innocent citizens hostage and it is up to [[Action Force]] to rescue them. They are being held in separate groups atop various urban buildings. Each block must be scaled by [[Quick Kick (G.I. Joe)|Quick Kick]] while [[Airtight (G.I. Joe)|Airtight]] covers him from the helicopter.

As with ''Action Force'', the player must shepherd a character across a dangerous environment, however the game is otherwise completely different.

The player controls the crosshairs of Airtight's weapon, and must shoot enemies that appear before they injure Quick Kick as he ascends the side of the building. Quick Kick also loses energy as the level progresses; it can be replenished by shooting the [[U.S. flags]] on the walls of some screens. When Quick Kick reaches the roof the hostages are released and make their way to the rescue helicopter.

At the end of each level Airtight may switch weapons; he can choose between a [[machine-gun]], [[bazooka]] or bio-gun, each of which has different advantages and drawbacks.

Every two levels the player must defeat a tank by shooting it a certain number of times within a time-limit.

===Background===
Martin Wheeler, one of the developers said:

<blockquote>I think ''Action Force 2'' was the game I was happiest with. We wrote it with instant arcade appeal in mind, deliberately playing on the tastes of the games reviewers who slated DD2. They gave it the 'Smash' we thought ''Dan Dare 2'' had deserved.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Battlefield/8875/mwheeler.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020505073520/http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Battlefield/8875/mwheeler.html |archive-date=2002-05-05 |title=Philip Bee, Interview with Martin Wheeler, December 1997 |date=2002-05-05 |access-date=2011-07-19}}</ref>

==Reception==
* ''[[Sinclair User]]'' on ''Action Force'':

<blockquote>The programming was done by the same people who did ''Rebel'' for Virgin, and it shows. ''Rebel'' looked big, bold and sharp, and so does ''Action Force''. It's one hell of a good game.<ref name="Sinclair User Review1">{{Citation|title=Action Force Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=November 1987}}</ref></blockquote>

* ''[[Sinclair User]]'' on ''Action Force II'':

<blockquote>Hey! This game is brilliant... After a bad patch Virgin seems to have regained its former glory. ''Dan Dare'' was brill, ''Dan Dare 2'' was exceptional and ''Action Force 2'', well it's transcended!"<ref name="Sinclair User Review2">{{Citation|title=Action Force II Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=May 1988}}</ref></blockquote>

* ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' on ''Action Force II'':

<blockquote>''Action Force 2'' is full of wonderful little touches: bullet-holes appear in the brickwork, torches on the walls burn, your gunsight judders as you hold down the trigger. Quick-Kick expires convincingly if the enemy manages to shoot him or drop weights on his head. If you remember to shoot the dustbins, keep blasting the flags to restore energy, and keep your cool against the tank, the early levels are fairly straightforward. But as it gets harder and harder, ''Action Force 2'' just gets better and better.<ref name="Your Sinclair Review">{{Citation|title=Action Force II Review|newspaper=[[Your Sinclair]]|date=June 1988}}</ref></blockquote>
