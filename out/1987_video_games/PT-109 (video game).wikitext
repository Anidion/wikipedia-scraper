'''''PT-109''''' is a [[naval simulation]] [[video game]] developed by Digital Illusions and [[Spectrum HoloByte]] in 1987 for the [[Macintosh]] and [[MS-DOS]]. This game is roughly based on the events involving the [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109]].

==Gameplay==
''PT-109'' is a torpedo-boat simulation game which starts in the practice-tactics mode to teach new players how to operate the boat, fire torpedoes, read radar on different displays, using the engine muffler to approach quietly, operating smoke screens, and locate other weaponry. Players also learn about the history of the ship, because some of the patrol boats were only available at specific stages during World War II. The game has four levels of difficulty, and it also gives the player the ability to send radio messages to the base to request air or ship support, an automatic pilot feature, and assignment of patrols.<ref name="Dragon140"/>

==Development==
A remake of ''PT-109'', called ''PT Boat Simulator'', was released for [[DOS]] PC in 1994.<ref name="Remake_Squakenet">{{cite web |title=1994 remake's Squakenet bio |url=https://www.squakenet.com/game/pt-boat-simulator/ |website=www.squakenet.com |publisher=Squakenet |access-date=24 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221206115729/https://www.squakenet.com/game/pt-boat-simulator/ |archive-date=December 6, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Reception==
A ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' reviewer in 1988 called ''PT-109'' "a remarkable achievement", but stated that he no longer played the game because he had played all of the preprogrammed patrols several times and knew what would happen. He recommended using the practice mode to become familiar with the game, instead of the lowest difficulty level, to maximize its lifetime.<ref name="proctor198809">{{cite magazine | title=PT-109 / Spectrum Holobyte's Torpedo Boat Simulation | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1988 | author=Proctor, Bob | pages=24}}</ref> 1991 and 1993 surveys of strategy and war games gave it two and a half stars out of five.<ref name="brooks199112">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=89 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: The 1900–1950 Epoch / Part II (M–Z) of an Annotated Paiktography | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
