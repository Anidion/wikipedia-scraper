{{nihongo|'''''Psycho Soldier'''''|サイコ・ソルジャー|Saiko Sorujā}} is a [[platform game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Japan]]ese software company [[SNK]]. It was released in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |title=サイコソルジャー |trans-title=Psycho Soldier |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/id/C35225 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |access-date=16 June 2021}}</ref> It is a distant sequel to ''[[Athena (video game)|Athena]]'', released a year earlier, featuring a late descendant of that game's main character. [[Ocean Software]] on their Imagine label released home computer versions of the game for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad]] in 1987.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Psycho Soldier Screen01.JPG|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot]]
''Psycho Soldier'' is an action [[sidescroller]]. Rocks and other destructible objects sometimes hold [[power-up]]s. Players utilize a special force known as "Psycho Energy" to perform a number of attacks, including creating a shield of rotating spheres around the character's body to protect them. The amount of Psycho Energy is measured by the energy bar located to the left of the player's available spheres, and can be increased by obtaining certain items. Players can launch the spheres out at enemies and destructible objects at the cost of using one. Depending on how much energy the player has, the spheres may produce a different result when used, such as bouncing around the screen or, when at max energy and swirling at a higher speed around the player, spreading out and destroy everything in their wake at the cost of some power.

Both Athena and Kensou share the same abilities, and whichever one the player chooses has no real bearing on the difficulty of the game. If the player fills their energy bar and collects a special item resembling a green egg, their character transforms into a "Psycho Creature", in Athena's case a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and for Kensou a green [[dragon]]. The psycho creatures have a powerful fire breath attack that hits enemies in front of them and a move which rams them into a single nearby enemy. The transformations last until the boss of the stage is defeated or until the player runs out of energy from taking too many hits.

==Plot==
''Psycho Soldier'' takes place many years after ''Athena''. In ''Athena'', the title character is a mystical figure loosely based on the [[Athena|goddess]] of [[Greek mythology]] who fights her way through several otherworldly lands in order to destroy various monsters and evil beings who threaten the peace of the land. After her journey is complete, she returns to [[heaven]], only to fade completely from the minds of the mortals who live below.

In the modern times of ''Psycho Soldier'', a young girl named [[Athena Asamiya]], who is the descendant of the original Athena, displays special psychic abilities that allow her to unlock a number of hidden powers within herself, and hopes to one day use these skills not only to help others, but to advance her stage career as a future pop idol. Several evil beings appear in her hometown in Japan, and along with her friend and fellow gifted psychic [[Sie Kensou]], she uses her talents to protect her friends and home from this new menace.

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Psycho Soldier'' on their April 15, 1987 issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=306|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 April 1987|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>

The ZX Spectrum version was published in 1987 by [[Imagine Software]], and was converted by Ross Harris (as Source Software).<ref>{{WoS game|id=0003922}}</ref> This port received moderate critical success. ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' awarded it 8 out of 10, praising the smooth sprite movement and well-tried formula gameplay, but lamenting the monochrome graphics and weak sound effects.<ref name="PSY-ZX"/> ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' awarded it 69% and 75%, one reviewer criticising the boring gameplay and Athena's slow reactions.<ref name="PYS-Crash"/>

==Legacy==
Both Athena and Kensou have been seen in other games. The character of Kensou was at the same time introduced as a teammate for Athena in ''[[The King of Fighters]]'' series as [[Sie Kensou]] and underwent several cosmetic changes (in previews of ''[[The King of Fighters XII]]'', Athena can be seen wearing her winter school uniform from ''Psycho Soldier'') as well as reworking his abilities to differentiate him from Athena. The version of Kensou seen in this game, however, has made a cameo in one of the special endings in ''[[The King of Fighters '97]]''. He was also featured in ''[[The King of Fighters 2000]]'' in his original costume as a special striker called "Psycho Soldier Kensou". This version of Kensou also appears in the recent ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS]]'' [[trading card game]] as an SNK character card. The characters Kensou and Athena, as well as the items Psycho Armor and Psycho Shield both appear in the game ''[[Crystalis]]'' for the NES, a post-apocalyptic [[role-playing video game]]. Also, Athena and Kensou wear their ''Psycho Soldier'' outfits in ''[[The King of Fighters XII]]'' as their default outfits. Ever since ''KOF XII''{{'}}s release, ''[[The King of Fighters XIII]]'' default outfit of Kensou was left unchanged. Athena's ''Psycho Soldier'' outfit was changed from default to alternate, leaving her more popular [[Japanese school uniform|sailor fuku]] outfit as her default outfit for the game.

Both Athena and Sie Kensou were also noted for being one of the first video game characters to have their own theme songs (which ''The King of Fighters'' would remix multiple times across its titles).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/game-music-of-the-day-psycho-soldier/|title=Game music of the day: Psycho Soldier|date=7 August 2010 |publisher=GamesRadar|access-date=September 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930115641/https://www.gamesradar.com/game-music-of-the-day-psycho-soldier/|archive-date=2018-09-30|url-status=live}}</ref>

Athena appears in ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' as a background character in the King of Fighters stage, which was released alongside [[Terry Bogard]] from ''[[Fatal Fury]]'' in November 2019. Athena is also present as a collectible Spirit in the game.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}
