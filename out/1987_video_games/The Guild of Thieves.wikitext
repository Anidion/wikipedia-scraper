The player's character is "an aspiring member of the infamous [[thieves' guild|Guild of Thieves]]" and is to steal all the valuables that can be found in and around an island castle.

The game was voted Best Adventure Game Of The Year at the [[Golden Joystick Awards]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Golden Joystick Awards 1988|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|date=May 1988|issue=79|page=39|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_079_1988-05_EMAP_Publishing_GB/Computer__Video_Games_Issue_079_1988-05_EMAP_Publishing_GB#page/n38/mode/1up|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]}}</ref>

''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' complimented the game, calling it an "exciting sequel" to ''[[The Pawn]]'', citing its "witty dialogue, outstanding graphics, wry humor, and challenging puzzles".<ref name="Dragon127">{{cite magazine|title=The Role of Computers|last1=Lesser |first1=Hartley|last2=Lesser |first2=Patricia |last3=Lesser |first3=Kirk| magazine=Dragon| issue=127|date=November 1987|pages=74–80}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1988 approved of the game's sophisticated parser, British humor, and high-quality graphics. It concluded, "the game must be highly recommended and it is ''tough'' ... it compares well with the best of [[Infocom]]".<ref name="roberts198802">{{cite magazine | title=Guild of Thieves | magazine=Computer Gaming World | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=44| date=February 1988 | access-date=2 November 2013 | last=Roberts |first=Alan | pages=38}}</ref> The magazine's [[Charles Ardai]] in 1992 called its puzzles "pretty good, requiring a certain amount of ingenuity ... None are particularly memorable, though. The game is good, but lacks the sparks of innovation that would elevate it above the level of dozens of similar games".<ref name="ardai199211">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100 | title=Virgin Software's Magnetic Scrolls Collection | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1992 | access-date=4 July 2014 | last=Ardai | first=Charles | author-link=Charles Ardai | pages=64}}</ref>

''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' stated "The outstanding graphics of ''The Pawn'' are matched by those in ''Guild of Thieves''. High-resolution pictures transport you into a medieval world of thieves, castles and treasure. The only complaint I have about the Atari XE/XL version is that most of the detailed graphics had only shades of one or two colors."<ref name="manor198805">{{Cite magazine |last=Manor |first=John |date=May 1988 |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v7n1/productreviews.html |title=Product Reviews | magazine=Antic |volume=7 |issue=1}}</ref>
