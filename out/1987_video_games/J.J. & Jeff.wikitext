'''''J.J. & Jeff''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Kato-chan & Ken-chan'''''|カトちゃんケンちゃん}}, is a [[side scrolling]] [[platform game]] for the [[TurboGrafx-16]]. The Japanese version of the game is loosely based on the popular comedy television show ''[[Kato-chan Ken-chan Gokigen TV|Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]]'', which American producer [[Vin Di Bona]] used as its inspiration for ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' in 1990. The game features off-beat characters and enemies, and [[toilet humour|toilet humor]], including [[flatulence]], [[urination]] and [[defecation]]<ref name="brooker">{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/apr/05/games.playstation|last=Brooker|first=Charlie|authorlink=Charlie Brooker |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-04-05|date=2008-04-05|title=Dork Talk}}</ref> in the Japanese release. In 2007, the game was re-released on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in [[North America]] on May 28, and in [[Europe]] on June 15.

==Plot==
''J.J. & Jeff'' are bungling detectives in the same vein as [[Inspector Clouseau]]. They are out to solve a kidnapping case.  In the Japanese version, ''Kato-chan & Ken-chan'', it is based mostly on the "Detective Story" segments of the show.

==Gameplay==
The player chooses either J.J. or Jeff as the main playable character. The non-selected character will appear at various moments in the game standing by lampposts and hiding in bushes, but remains unplayable.

The player can utilize three attacks: kick, jump, or using a can of spray paint.

The game included six levels (fields) split into four parts, even though the manual says there are a total of 8 levels.

A [[life bar]] labeled "Vitality" depletes as the character is injured. Eating food hidden in each level will replenish this meter. Found money can be used to play a [[slot machine]] game for items. The [[slot machine]] is one of several hidden rooms found in each level. Kicking random objects can produce money, food, and other items.  Extra lives are obtained at 70,000, 150,000, 300,000 and 500,000 points.

==Release==
The original Japanese game has a heavy emphasis on sophomoric toilet humor, most of which was removed for the American version. For example, in the Japanese version, the spray can was originally Kato and Ken's own [[flatulence]]. Also, the unplayable character was originally defecating in the bushes and urinating on lampposts, but the urine was removed, and the character was seen wearing a bear mask in the American version.

==Reception==
''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reviewed ''Chan & Chan'' in 1989, giving it a 91% score. They said it "has got to be one of the rudest and funniest platform games around" with "a myriad of secret screens and bonuses to discover." They recommended that "PC Engine fans shouldn't miss it."<ref name="CVG">{{cite journal |title=Complete Games Guide |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref>
