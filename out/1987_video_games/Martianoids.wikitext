'''''Martianoids''''' is a [[ZX Spectrum]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ultimate Play the Game]] and released in 1987.<ref>{{Citation |last=Ultimate Play The Game |title=Martianoids |date=1987 |url=http://archive.org/details/zx_Martianoids_1987_Ultimate_Play_The_Game |access-date=2024-02-16 |publisher=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Although it uses [[isometric projection]], as with Ultimate's second-generation isometric releases such as ''[[Nightshade (1985 video game)|Nightshade]]'' and ''[[Gunfright]]'', ''Martianoids'' used a [[scrolling]] display rather than the [[flip-screen]] of earlier titles such as ''[[Knight Lore]]'' and ''[[Alien 8]]''.

As with the contemporary Ultimate title ''[[Bubbler (video game)|Bubbler]]'', ''Martianoids'' was not written by the partnership of [[Tim Stamper (programmer)|Tim Stamper]] and [[Chris Stamper]].  It was instead programmed by a team at [[U.S. Gold]], and was therefore an Ultimate game in name only.  It was Ultimate's penultimate title for 8-bit home computers. In 1988 the company became [[Rare (company)|Rare]], embarking on a long-running partnership with [[Nintendo]] to develop console games.

==Plot==
Players are given a cryptic introduction describing an attack by aliens known as "The Martianoids". The Martianoids enter the player's ship and attack the brain of the ship with "photon weapons".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/40/martianoids.htm|title=CRASH 40 - Martianoids}}</ref>  The player must act to prevent further damage. The player has lasers for defence which destroy internal walls, computer components and so forth, and the aliens.<ref>http://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/m/Martianoids.txt {{Bare URL plain text|date=March 2022}}</ref>
