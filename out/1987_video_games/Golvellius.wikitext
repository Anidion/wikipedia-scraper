{{nihongo|'''''Maou Golvellius'''''|魔王ゴルベリアス| |''lit. "Devil Golvellius"''}}  is an [[action role-playing video game]] developed by [[Compile (publisher)|Compile]] and originally released for the Japanese [[MSX]] home computer system in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]]. Later that year (1988), Compile released yet another remake for the [[MSX2]] system, titled {{nihongo|'''''Shin Maou Golvellius'''''|真・魔王ゴルベリアス| |''lit. "True Devil Golvellius"''}}. This game featured mostly the same graphics as the ones in the Sega Master System version, but the overworld and dungeon layouts are entirely different.

==Sega Master System==

[[Sega]] licensed the franchise in 1988 and released the game for the [[Master System]] (the Mark III in Japan), featuring enhanced graphics and entirely different overworld and dungeon layouts. This version was released worldwide under the name ''Golvellius: Valley of Doom''.  The plot revolved around the hero (Kelesis) entering the Valley of Doom to save the Princess Rena, who had gone to the valley to obtain a rare herb needed to heal her father the King.<ref>"Golvellius, Valley of Doom", Instruction Manual (Sega Master System), pg 2-3</ref>

Gameplay mostly focused on a top down action game, where the player attacked various monsters with a sword, sometimes opening up secret chambers where various characters would offer advice, better weapons, and other items.  The game was divided into eight distinct environments<ref group=N>Valley, desert, graveyard, fields, swamp, beach, woods, and forest.  The "fields" level connects the graveyard and swamp and has no boss to defeat</ref> each ruled by a boss, which needed to be defeated before progressing to the next area of the map.<ref group=N>A loophole in the game allows the player, once acquiring aqua-boots, to enter the final level much earlier using an underground river, yet the level is nearly impossible to navigate due to the lack of proper weapons and experience levels</ref>  The game also consisted of an underground portion in caverns, rotating between a side ways advancing and top down scrolling screen in order to reach a level boss's lair.

The final level, only reachable once all boss monsters have been defeated, is to defeat Golvellius who has a secret lair revealed only by following clues of the game characters.  Once Golvellius is defeated it is revealed he was possessed by a [[demon]] and is in fact a good and kind creature who now will travel with the hero Kelesis.  The game implies a sequel involving Kelesis, Golvellius, and the Princess Rena, but this was never produced.

==Other versions==

In 2009 it was announced by [[DotEmu]]/D4 Entreprise that ''Golvellius'' was to be re-released for the [[iPhone OS]] platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/golvellius--valley-of-doom--master-system-s-answer-to-the-legend-of-zelda--coming-to-the-iphone-next-month |title=Golvellius: Valley of Doom |author=Games Press |date=2009-07-23 |publisher=[[Gamesindustry.biz]] |accessdate=2009-07-23 }}</ref> It is a port of the Master System version.<ref name="Hardcore Gaming 101"/>
