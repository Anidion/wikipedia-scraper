'''''President Elect: 1988 Edition''''' is a 1987 video game written by Nelson Hernandez, and published by [[Strategic Simulations]]. It is an updated version of the 1980 game styled ''[[President Elect (video game)|President Elect]]''.

==Gameplay==
''President Elect: 1988 Edition'' is a game in which the 1988 [[1988 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican primaries]] and [[1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic primaries]], and the [[1988 United States presidential election]] are simulated.<ref name="CGW51"/> The player can choose from any presidential election from 1960 to 1988 inclusive. The election can be either historical or ahistorical (the latter effectively a custom scenario). 

''President Elect: 1988 Edition'' was released in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] for the Apple II and Commodore 64, as well as for the Atari ST and MS-DOS computers.<ref name="compute">{{cite journal|last1=Bobo|first1=Ervin|title=President Elect: 1988 Edition|journal=Compute!|date=October 1987|issue=89|page=32|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue89/President_Elect.php}}</ref> The 1988 Edition did not change gameplay at all from the earlier ''[[President Elect (video game)|President Elect]]'', but added the historical [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] vs. [[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] 1984 election, with a new 1988 scenario with no historical candidates. The game also added new playable candidates, such as [[Bill Clinton]], [[Bruce Babbitt]], [[Michael Dukakis]], [[Richard Gephardt]], [[Geraldine Ferraro]], [[Jack Kemp]], and [[Oliver North]].

==Reception==
Wyatt Lee reviewed ''President Elect: 1988 Edition'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', stating that "''President Elect 1988 Edition'' is a stimulating, educational, and challenging experience of American presidential politics. If you follow political events with any interest at all, you owe it to yourself to play this game, at least, once".<ref name="CGW51">{{cite magazine |last=Lee |first=Wyatt |title=Campaign '88: A Survey of Political Election Games for the Computer |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September 1988 |volume=1 |issue=51 |pages=14–15}}</ref>

''President Elect'' author Nelson Hernandez—calling himself "the best predictor of presidential elections in the country"—claimed that, with the 1988 edition of the game, in July 1988 he predicted the electoral and popular votes of the [[1988 United States presidential election|election that year]] within 1% each of the actual results.<ref name="aycock198911">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-11-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_114_1989_Nov#page/n93/mode/2up | title=Get Real | work=Compute! | date=November 1989 | accessdate=11 November 2013 | author=Aycock, Heidi E.

[[Orson Scott Card]] favorably reviewed the 1988 edition of ''President Elect'' for ''[[Compute!]]''. While he criticized aspects of the game's design, he noted that the game accurately simulated how "the strongest forces", like the economy, "are completely out of the players' control ... that's the way it works in the real world".<ref name="card198805">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_096_1988_May#page/n9/mode/2up | title=Do You Want to Change the World?
