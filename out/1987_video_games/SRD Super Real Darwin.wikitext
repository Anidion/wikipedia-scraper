{{nihongo|'''''SRD: Super Real Darwin'''''|SRDスーパーリアルダーウィン|SRD: Sūpā Riaru Dāwin}} is a [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] vertical [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Data East]]. It is the sequel to Data East's [[1986 in video gaming|1986]] arcade game, ''[[Darwin 4078]]''. The player takes control of a small fighter ship capable of mutating into different shapes. The ship's appearance will change with upgraded weapons as the player obtain more [[power-up]]s.

==Plot==
The story starts on the planet Lakya where the technologically advanced inhabitants of the planet unwittingly unleash the planet's life force known as Evol. As the released Evol drifts from planet Lakya, it is received by the inhabitants of the nearby planet Cokyo; the people of Cokyo initiate the Shlohe project, a plan to use their captured Evol to develop advanced biologic ships and weapons to invade planet Lakya. The inhabitants of Lakya retaliate the Cokyo invasion by using their own evolving fighter ships.

==Ports==

''SRD: Super Real Darwin'' was later ported by [[Sega]] for the [[Sega Mega Drive]] console in 1990 under the title {{nihongo|'''''Darwin 4081'''''|ダーウィン4081}}. Although a home port of the second game, Darwin 4081 was numbered 4081 because it was the 4th game that used the evolution system after Darwin (4078), S.R.D. (4079), and [[Act-Fancer: Cybernetick Hyper Weapon|Act-Fancer]] (4080). In [[2010 in video gaming|2010]], a [[Wii]] compilation titled ''[[Data East Arcade Classics]]'' was released and includes the arcade version of ''SRD: Super Real Darwin''.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Super Real Darwin'' on their December 1, 1987 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the year.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=321|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 December 1987|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>
