'''''Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer''''' is an [[Amateur flight simulation|aircraft simulation]] [[computer game]] published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1987. It was originally released as '''''Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Simulator'''''. Due to a legal dispute with Microsoft over the term "Flight Simulator", the game was pulled from shelves and renamed. Many copies of the original version were sold prior to this. [[Chuck Yeager]] served as technical consultant for the game, where his likeness and voice were prominently used.

The game allows a player to "test pilot" 14 different airplanes, including the [[Bell X-1]], which Yeager had piloted to become the first man to exceed Mach 1.

The game is embellished by Yeager's laconic commentary: When the user crashes one plane, Yeager remarks "You sure bought the farm on that one", or other asides.
