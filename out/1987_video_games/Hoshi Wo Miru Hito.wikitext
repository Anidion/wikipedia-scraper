== Story ==
The game is set in a [[cyberpunk]]-style future world in which the supercomputer Crew III has brainwashed Earth's population into driving themselves to extinction. The only ones who can resist Crew III are those with [[extrasensory perception]], whom Crew III has sent a team of bounty hunters to wipe out. By the time the game begins, only four psychics --- who, incidentally, are the four [[Player character|player characters]] --- are known to remain: the children Minami, Shiba, Misa, and Aine. The four must journey to Ark City, and eventually, outer space, in order to defeat Crew III.

In the end, however, the party learns that Crew III didn't exist; rather, the humans were being brainwashed by a race of sapient [[Dolphin|dolphins]] who, depending on the player's choices, want to either annihilate or befriend the human race.

== Gameplay ==
''Hoshi wo Miru Hito'' is a science fiction RPG<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Nostalgic Famicom Perfect Guide|publisher=M.B.MOOK|year=2016|isbn=9784906735891|pages=28|language=JA|oclc=961800615}}</ref> infamous for its difficult gameplay and elements that make the game confusing and cryptic. For example, at the beginning of the game, the player is put into the field map without any explanation on any goals, and the entrance to the first town the player needs to visit is not displayed on the field map at all.<ref name=":0" /> There is no "escape" command; the player needs to learn a specific ESP skill by levelling up in order to escape from battles.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |script-title=ja:死ぬ前にクリアしたい200の無理ゲー ファミコン&スーファミ|date=October 10, 2018|publisher=My Way Publishing|isbn=9784865119855|location=Tokyo|pages=38|language=ja|oclc=1051229562}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

In the early part of the game, there is only a single way to restore health, which is a single spot within the first town.<ref name=":1" />

[[Game over]] occurs when all the players characters reach zero [[hit points]]. Early in the game, it's very easy to die due to poor balancing, powerful enemies, and inability to escape from battles, but later in the game the player's characters become strong enough that it's very difficult to kill the entire party.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |script-title=ja:ファミコンクソゲー番付|date=January 25, 2017|publisher=My Way Publishing|isbn=9784865116373|location=Tōkyō|pages=73|language=ja|oclc=968201147}}</ref>

== Release ==
The game was published on October 27, 1987, for the Famicom home console, and published by HOT-B.<ref>
