{{nihongo foot|'''''R-Type'''''|アール・タイプ|''Āru Taipu''||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[scrolling shooter|horizontally scrolling shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and released by [[Irem]] in 1987 and the first game in the [[List of R-Type video games|''R-Type'' series]]. The player controls a star ship, the R-9 "Arrowhead", in its efforts to destroy the Bydo, a powerful alien race bent on wiping out all of mankind. The R-9 can acquire a glowing orbicular device called a "Force", protecting it from enemy fire and providing additional firepower. The arcade version was distributed by [[Nintendo]] in North America; it is the last arcade title Nintendo distributed.

''R-Type'' was the first game to run on Irem's 16-bit M72 arcade system. The development team drew inspiration from ''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and works by [[H.R. Giger]]. The music was composed by Masato Ishizaki, while character designs were by Akio Oyabu.<ref name="STGv9">{{cite magazine|last=Tanaka|first=Haruhisa|title=R-Type Creator Interview (クリエイターインタビュー): Masato Ishizaki (石崎正人)|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=9|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=25 March 2014|pages=50–57|lang=ja|isbn=978-4896374551}} ([http://shmuplations.com/rtypesound/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200123082717/http://shmuplations.com/rtypesound/|date=2020-01-23}}).</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://clrc.myshopify.com/products/m_r-type|title=R-TYPE ORIGINAL SOUND BOX|work=Clarice Shop|publisher=[[City Connection (company)|City Connection]]|date=2021|access-date=2021-03-09|language=ja|archive-date=2021-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210211103215/https://clrc.myshopify.com/products/m_r-type|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's title stems from the word "ray", as in a ray of light, in reference to the player's raylike weapons used throughout the game.

''R-Type'' was commercially successful and celebrated by critics for its graphics and addictive gameplay, but was criticized for its difficulty. It is commonly cited as one of the best shoot 'em up video games, and one of [[List of video games considered the best|the greatest video games of all time]]. Its success inspired several sequel and spinoff games, and home ports and releases for digital distribution services. A remake of the game was released as ''R-Type DX'' for the Game Boy Color in 2000. A 3D remake, ''[[R-Type Dimensions]]'', was released for the [[Xbox 360]] in 2009; for the [[PlayStation 3]] in 2014; for the [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Windows]] in 2018; and for [[iOS]] in 2019.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC R-Type.png|thumb|left|Fighting Dobkeratops, the game's first boss, in the arcade version]]

The game has a generally slower pace than similar shooting games of the time and emphasizes enemy pattern memorization as much as player speed. It is composed of eight levels, with a [[boss (video games)|boss enemy]] at the end of each. The player controls a small spacecraft and must navigate terrain and fight enemies using the various ship weapons. The player's spacecraft has, by default, a weak but rapid-firing main gun; and a more powerful gun called the Wave Cannon, which requires the player to hold their fire to build up power for the cannon.

During the game, the player can obtain an auxiliary device called a Force. This resembles a glowing orange ball. The Force can be attached to the front or back of the player's spacecraft, or detached to fly freely. When attached, the Force provides one of three different powerful weapons, in addition to the main gun and the Wave Cannon.

When detached, these weapons cannot be used, but the Force will instead resort to a secondary set of guns, which can be fired by the player even if the Force is at a distance from the spacecraft. The Force has a secondary use as a shield; it is completely indestructible and can block most things fired at it, as well as damage or destroy enemies on contact. Game designer AKIBO mentioned the behavior of [[dung beetles]] as an inspiration for the Force.<ref name="G15">{{cite magazine|last1=Ishii|first1=Zenji|last2=Suzuki|first2=GOD|url=https://archive.org/stream/gamest0015#page/n12/mode/2up|title=R-TYPE開発座談会; R-TYPE Q&A|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=15|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=December 1987|pages=10–12|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/rtype1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230193200/http://shmuplations.com/rtype1/|date=2019-12-30}}).</ref><ref name="WTF151">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/famitsu0151#page/93/mode/1up|title=ゲームデザ イナー大全集|magazine=[[Famitsu]]|issue=151|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation]]|date=November 8, 1991|pages=85–100|lang=ja}} ([https://shmuplations.com/imadethat/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200520011507/https://shmuplations.com/imadethat/|date=2020-05-20}}).</ref>

==Development==
{{Expand section|date=November 2020}}
Development on the Commodore 64 version began when [[Activision]]'s Electric Dreams Software subsidiary obtained the rights. David Jolliff was planning on to program the game with James Smart assisting in program help. The original version was shelved, and as a result of the settlement between the creators of ''[[Katakis]]'' and Activision, Manfred Trenz of Rainbow Arts had the right to do a port, which was made in six weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=R-Type V1 (C64) - 1988 Electric Dreams - GTW64|url=https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/rtype-v1/|access-date=2021-12-11|website=Games That Weren't|year=1988 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Release==
[[Hudson Soft]] developed<ref>{{Cite web|author=blackoak|url=http://shmuplations.com/pcengine/|title=shmuplations.com|website=shmuplations.com|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> a fairly accurate port of R-Type that was released for the [[TurboGrafx-16]] (a.k.a. PC Engine) console, although it suffered from a slightly lower resolution, reduced colour palette, sprite flickering and slowdown. Due to the slightly reduced resolution, the playfield also scrolls slightly in the vertical axis whenever the player's ship approaches the top or bottom of the screen. The Japanese release was split across two game cards (HuCards) titled {{nihongo|'''''R-Type I'''''|アール・タイプI|Āru Taipu Wan}} and {{nihongo|'''''R-Type II'''''|アール・タイプII|Āru Taipu Tsū}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogameden.com/hucard.htm?rt1 |title=Video Game Den |publisher=Video Game Den |access-date=2011-08-13}}</ref> and the later North American release contained the entire game on a single card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/rtype/rtype.htm|title=R-Type|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202031245/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/rtype/rtype.htm|archive-date=February 2, 2016|access-date=2011-08-13}}</ref> The TurboGrafx-16 version of ''R-Type'' has a boss at the end of Stage 6, rather than a prolonged wave of enemies as in all other versions.

The [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game ''R-Type Dimensions'' was released on February 4, 2009, by Tozai Games. It is a port of the original ''R-Type'' and the sequel ''R-Type II''. It can be played either with the original [[2D graphics]] or with new [[3D graphics]], and has added [[co-op gameplay]] functionality. An analogous version for PS3 has been released in May, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/05/20/r-type-dimensions-out-today-on-ps3/ |title=R-Type Dimensions Out Today on PS3 – PlayStation.Blog |date=May 20, 2014 |publisher=blog.us.playstation.com|access-date=2015-09-04}}</ref>

A ''[[Mean Machines]]'' magazine review praised in particular the graphics and the high quality of the challenge offered by the game, awarding it an overall rating of 92%.<ref name="MM7">Mean Machines, [[iarchive:mean-machines-magazine-07/page/n87/mode/2up|R-Type Review]], Issue 7, April 1991, pp.88-90</ref> In 1989, ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]'' listed it as one of the top five best games available for both the PC Engine and Master System.<ref name="ACE"/>

A 1995 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' stated that the "PC Engine [TurboGrafx-16] conversion of Irem's arcade smash ''R-Type'' is still regarded as the system's definitive contribution to the shoot 'em up genre."<ref>{{cite magazine|date=March 1995|title=Hudson Soft|url=https://archive.org/details/nextgen-issue-003/page/n81/mode/2up|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|issue=3|page=78}}</ref> The following year they listed both it and the arcade original (but not any other ports of the game) at number 98 in their "Top 100 Games of All Time", praising its art direction, graphics, design innovations, and huge bosses.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=September 1996|title=Top 100 Games of All Time|url=https://archive.org/details/nextgen-issue-021/page/n41/mode/2up|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|issue=21|page=38}}</ref>

In a retrospective review, [[Allgame]] editor Shawn Sackenheim described the TurboGrafx-16 version of R-Type as "(the) most accurate home conversion (of the arcade version) of the game", furthermore stating that "it's the shooter that started it all and it's still a thrill ride from beginning to end".<ref name="allgamereview" />

===Computers===
The [[ZX Spectrum]] version of ''R-Type'' was awarded 9/10 in the January 1989 issue of ''[[Your Sinclair]]''<ref name="ysrnry2">{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/rtype.htm |title=R-Type |publisher=ysrnry.co.uk |access-date=2015-09-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626201818/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/rtype.htm |archive-date=June 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and was placed at number 6 in their official top 100. ''The Games Machine'' praised the "incredible use of colour" and that it "blows away almost every other shoot'em up on the Spectrum". ''Crash'' congratulated Electric Dreams for "retaining the frenetic arcade feel and producing such a brilliant game". ''Sinclair User'' praised the weapons system and difficulty curve. ''[[Computer and Video Games|C+VG]]'' concluded their review by saying "an excellent shoot'em up that's both challenging and addictive. An absolute must for Spectrum blasting fanatics".

The game was runner-up in the category of Best 8-Bit Coin-Op Conversion of the Year at the [[Golden Joystick Awards]], behind ''[[Operation Wolf]]''.<ref name="GJ">{{cite magazine |title=Golden Joysticks 1989|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue092/Pages/CVG09200062.jpg |magazine=[[Computer + Video Games]] |issue=92 |date=June 1989 |page=63 |access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref>

The implementation of the music in the C64 version was well received, however this port got average reviews due to performance issues and glitches.

==Legacy==
{{See|List of R-Type video games}}

Irem has developed a number of [[sequel]]s and related games, including ''[[R-Type II]]'' and ''[[Armed Police Unit Gallop]]''. Their ''[[XMultiply]]'', although not part of the series, has similar themes and gameplay, and was released around the same time as ''R-Type II''. However, before any of these games was ''[[Katakis]]'', a 1987 clone produced by [[Factor 5]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and the [[Amiga]].

In 1991, [[Konami]] released ''[[Xexex]]'', a game heavily influenced by ''R-Type'' and ''XMultiply''. The game used similar weapons and concepts, such as the "Flint" being a combination of ''R-Type'' Force and ''X Multiply'' tentacle equipment.

Other games similar to ''R-Type'' are ''Rezon'', released by Allumer in 1991,<ref name="klov">{{cite web|url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9309 |title=Rezon Videogame by Taito/Allumer (1991) - The International Arcade Museum and the KLOV|website=klov.com|access-date=2015-09-04}}</ref> [[Aicom]]'s ''[[Pulstar (video game)|Pulstar]]'' and ''[[Blazing Star]]'' (the latter published under [[Yumekobo]]) for the [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo Geo]], and Technosoft's 1992 title ''[[Thunder Force IV]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]].

On April 1, 2019, [[Granzella]] announced the development of [[R-Type Final 2]], a sequel to [[R-Type Final]].

A remake of the game has been announced for release exclusively for the [[Intellivision Amico]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Intellivision Reveals Initial Details For The Upcoming Amico Home Video Game Console!|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intellivision-reveals-initial-details-for-the-upcoming-amico-home-video-game-console-300734998.html|website=PR Newswire}}</ref>

[[Chris Huelsbeck]] composed new title songs for Amiga and Commodore 64 versions which have remained as popular targets for game music remixers. Anthem-like Amiga theme is composed by Huelsbeck alone while C64's faster theme is composed by Huelsbeck with Ramiro Vaca.
