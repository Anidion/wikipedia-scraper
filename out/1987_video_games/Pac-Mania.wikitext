{{nihongo foot|'''''Pac-Mania'''''|パックマニア|Pakku-Mania|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[Oblique_projection #Cavalier_projection|cavalier perspective]] [[maze game]] that was developed and released by [[Namco]] for [[arcade game|arcades]] in 1987. In the game, the player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]] as he must eat all of the dots while avoiding the colored ghosts that chase him in the maze. Eating large flashing "Power Pellets" will allow Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for bonus points, which lasts for a short period of time. A new feature to this game allows Pac-Man to jump over the ghosts to evade capture. It is the ninth title in the ''[[List of Pac-Man video games|Pac-Man]]'' video game series and was the last one developed for arcades up until the release of ''[[Namco Classic Collection Vol. 2|Pac-Man Arrangement]]'' in 1996. Development was directed by ''Pac-Man'' creator [[Toru Iwatani]]. It was licensed to [[Atari Games]] for release in North America.

''Pac-Mania'' gained a highly-positive critical reception for its uniqueness and gameplay. It was nominated for "Best Coin-Op Conversion of the Year" at the [[Golden Joystick Awards]] in 1987, although it lost to [[Taito]]'s ''[[Operation Wolf]]''. ''Pac-Mania'' was ported to several home consoles and computers, including the [[Atari ST]], [[MSX2]], [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the last of which being published by [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]]. Several ''Pac-Man'' and Namco video game collections also included the game. Ports for the [[Wii Virtual Console]], [[iOS]] and [[mobile phones]] were also produced.

==Gameplay==

''Pac-Mania'' is a maze game viewed from an [[oblique projection|oblique]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZglGi-MDZIC&pg=PT96|title=Game Design Essentials|last=Mitchell|first=Briar Lee|publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]|date=2012|access-date=2022-06-24|page=82|isbn=978-1-118-23933-9}}</ref> perspective and with a gameplay similar to [[Pac-Man#Gameplay|the franchise's original installment]].<ref name=Hardcore-Gaming-101>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/pac-mania/|title=Pac-Mania|author=Bobinator|work=[[Hardcore Gaming 101]]|date=2019-08-16|access-date=2022-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220624171055/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/pac-mania/|archive-date=2022-06-24|url-status=live}}</ref> The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], a yellow circular creature that must eat all of the pellets in each stage while avoiding five colored ghosts - Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), Clyde (orange) and Sue (purple). Eating large Power Pellets will cause the ghosts to turn [[blue]] and flee, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points and send them to the house in the middle of the stage. Clearing the stage of dots and pellets will allow Pac-Man to move to the next. Mazes scroll both horizontally and vertically, and the left and right edges of some layouts [[wraparound (video games)|wrap around]] to each other. Touching a non-vulnerable ghost costs the player one life. 

New to this game is the ability to jump over the ghosts, allowing Pac-Man to evade capture. Later rounds of the game introduce two new ghosts, Funky (green) and Spunky (grey), who also have the ability to jump. While Pac-Man can still barely jump over Funky, it is impossible to jump over Spunky.<ref name=Hardcore-Gaming-101/> Eating a certain number of pellets will cause a bonus item to appear in the middle of the stage, which can be eaten for points. Some of these bonus items are called Special Items, which are items from later levels, or are Red and Green Power Pellets. Red Power Pellets double the point values of blue ghosts (this bonus is lost if Pac-Man loses a life), and Green Power Pellets temporarily increase Pac-Man's speed. If the player takes too long to clear a stage, Pac-Man's jumping power begins to decrease steadily until it is entirely lost.

Four different mazes are available: Block Town, Pac-Man's Park, Sandbox Land, and Jungly Steps. Upon completing a set number of rounds in each maze, the player progresses to the next; after playing through all four, the cycle restarts. At the beginning of the game, the player can choose to start in any of the first three mazes and will earn a score bonus for choosing either Pac-Man's Park or Sandbox Land and completing the first round in it.

The game ends when the player has either lost all lives or (depending on the machine setting) cycled through all four mazes a set number of times.

''Pac-Mania'' arrived on all of the major 8- and 16-bit systems in Europe in 1988, which were [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] in October, [[Commodore 64]] later that year, and [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] in December. The conversions were designed and ported by Teque Software, then composed of the duo Peter Harrap and Shaun Hollingworth, and the games were published by ''[[Grandslam Entertainment]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=From the Archives: Krisalis|last=Reed|first=Michael|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=2011-10-13|issue=95|page=76}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/thegamesmachine-13/page/n64|title=Action Pac-ed|magazine=[[The Games Machine]]|date=December 1988|access-date=2022-06-24|issue=13|page=65}}</ref> The same company developed an [[Acorn Archimedes]] port,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Pac-Man|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=March 2018|issue=179}}</ref> which was published by [[Domark]] in 1991.

''Pac-Mania'' was later ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in late 1990 and the [[Master System]]{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} and [[Sega Genesis]] in 1991 by [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]]. All three were released in North America, and the latter two in Europe as well, with the Master System port published by [[TecMagik]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_17/page/n34|title=Next Wave: Pacmania|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|date=December 1990|access-date=2022-06-24|issue=17|page=34}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-VVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA138|title=The Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Encyclopedia: Every Game Released for Sega's 16-bit Console|last=Scullion|first=Chris|publisher=[[White Owl (books)|White Owl]]|date=2021|access-date=2022-06-24|page=138|isbn=978-1-52674-659-7}}</ref> The Genesis port was outsourced to [[Sculptured Software]].

==Legacy==
The arcade version of Pac-Mania appeared in ''[[Namco Museum Volume 5]]'', the 2001 ''Namco Museum'' release, ''Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary'' and ''[[Namco Museum Virtual Arcade]]''. In 2001, it was one of the games included in ''[[Pac-Man Collection]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. Later, in 2002, the arcade version was re-released and included as an unlockable bonus in ''[[Pac-Man World 2]]''. In 2007, ''Pac-Mania'' was also released in ''[[Namco Museum Remix]]'' with ''[[Pac & Pal]]'', ''[[Pac 'n Roll]]'', ''[[Super Pac-Man]]'' and other non-Pac-Man games and was re-released in 2010 as part of the follow-up compilation ''Namco Museum Megamix'', along with 17 other Namco arcade games and six remix games, five of which appeared in ''Namco Museum Remix''.

In 2010, the design of Pac-Man and the ghosts from ''Pac-Mania'' appear in ''[[Pac-Man Championship Edition DX]]'' and the game itself is released as an app in the App Store for iOS devices. ''Pac-Mania'' was also re-released as part of the ''[[List of Namco video game compilations#Pac-Man's Arcade Party|Pac-Man's Arcade Party]]'' arcade machine in 2010 for Pac-Man's 30th anniversary. In February 2014 it was included in the ''[[Pac-Man Museum]]'' on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC via Steam. In 2018, it was included in the ''[[List of Namco video game compilations#Pac-Man's Pixel Bash|Pac-Man's Pixel Bash]]'' arcade cabinet, along with other Pac-Man, and different Namco games. The game is included in the 2022 compilation title ''[[Pac-Man Museum+]]'', released for PC via Steam, [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Nintendo Switch]]. On December 8, 2022, ''Pac-Mania'' was also included as part of the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' by [[Hamster Corporation]].

The music from Pac-Man's Park was later used in ''[[Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures]]'' as the "power up" theme for "Pac" (the show's version of Pac-Man). The same theme, along with Block Town's music, was remixed and used in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and later ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.
