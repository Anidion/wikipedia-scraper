'''Ballerburg''' is a turnbased [[Artillery game]] from 1987, written in [[C (programming language)|C]] by Eckhard Kruse for the [[Atari ST]]. The game was distributed free of charge as [[public domain software]]. It was also [[donationware]] as the author asked for donations of 20 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]], offering as incentive the [[source code]] for the game.<ref>[http://www.eckhardkruse.net/atari_st/baller.html April 1987: Ballerburg - Zwei Spieler, zwei Burgen und ein Berg dazwischen...] on eckhardkruse.net ''"Ich habe das Programm als Public Domain veröffentlicht (die Unterscheidung in Freeware, Shareware usw. gab es damals nicht), mit der Bitte um eine 20 DM Spende. Dafür gab es dann die erweitere Version und den Quellcode."'' (in German)</ref>

== Gameplay ==
Ballerburg was designed for two players, both of which can be human or computer-controlled. In the game, two enemy [[Monarchy|kingdoms]], separated by a mountain, try to destroy the [[castle]] of the enemy by exchanging [[Round shot|cannonballs]]. Two conditions can lead to victory: either you pulverize the opponent's king by directly hitting him with a cannonball, or you ruin the enemy kingdom's economy until the king capitulates automatically. There is a choice of various castles, each of them outfitted with multiple cannons, one destroyable storage room for each, gunpowder, cannonballs and money, and a [[vane anemometer|vane]]. One cannon can be fired per turn, which is done by adjusting the firing angle and amount of powder. An additional challenge is generated by the wind, which changes its strength each turn. The game also simulates a simple economy system: Prices to replenish the stock of balls and powder and replace destroyed cannons and vanes alter each turn. You have the possibility to build (destroyable) [[derrick]]s for more income and can raise or lower taxes, which will be reflected in the morale of your people. Unhappy people would abandon you and instead join your opponent.

== Legacy ==
Years later, in October 2004,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041010034944/http://www.eckhardkruse.net/atari_st/baller.html baller] on eckhardkruse.net (archived October 2004)</ref> the author released the game with [[source code]] for [[Freeware|free download]] on his website ([[public domain software]]). The source code availability resulted in several [[Source port|ports]] to other systems with [[Simple DirectMedia Library|SDL]],<ref>[http://baller.tuxfamily.org/ Ballerburg SDL] on baller.tuxfamily.org</ref> for instance to [[Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS]].

In April 2012, on the 25th birthday of the game, an [[iOS]] [[Source port|port]] was released, endorsed by the original author.<ref>[http://www.eckhardkruse.net/atari_st/baller.html baller] by Eckhard Kruse ''"DonkeyCat haben also mein Ok für die Ballerburg-Portierung bekommen und mich über die Entwicklung und Release stets auf dem Laufenden gehalten,"'' (2012-04-12, in German)</ref>

In 2001 there was another game by [[Ascaron]], without endorsement of Kruse, under the name Ballerburg.<ref>[http://www.gamezone.de/Ballerburg-Spiel-18537/News/Ballerburg-Release-Dezember-894259/ Ballerburg-Release-Dezember] on gamezone.de (December 2001, in German)</ref><ref>[http://www.gamestar.de/specials/reports/1958674/die_akte_ascaron_p2.html Die Akte Ascaron - Große Hits, große Reinfälle] on [[gamestar]].de (2009, in German)</ref> In 2003 the game was ported by Phoenix Games to the PS1.
