}}'''''Basketball Challenge''''' is a [[computer game]] developed by the [[XOR Corporation]] in 1987 for the [[IBM PC]] and compatibles.

==Gameplay==
''Basketball Challenge'' is a game in which the player is the [[Coach (sport)|coach]] of a [[basketball]] team, and determines how the team uses plays and sets, as well as what they do for offense and defense. The basketball players are represented by numbers on the court shown on screen, and the coach must utilize the team's star players effectively and get the best performance out of the other team members. ''Basketball Challenge'' is designed for one or two players, although a human opponent can play against the computer or let the computer run as both players.<ref name="Dragon136"/> At the beginning of the game the player is given the option to choose offensive and defensive plays including lineup and tempo. During the game you have the ability to communicate with team players. You also have the ability to coach a player and this can lead to changing tactics or even substituting players during deadball.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/basketball-challenge/credits.|title="Basketball Challenge (1987) - Mobygames".}}</ref> <!-- Aabdella98 -->
