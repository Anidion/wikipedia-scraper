== Development ==
After the North American [[video game crash of 1983]] no more ''RealSports'' title were developed under the management of [[Warner Communications]]. After [[Jack Tramiel]] bought the Consumer Division of [[Atari, Inc.]] in 1984 and video game development got back into focus, it was decided that two more ''RealSports'' titles will be produced—''RealSports Boxing'' and the [[Atari 7800]] version of ''[[RealSports Baseball]]''. The game was programmed by Alex DeMeo.

The game was heavily featured in the [[Atari 2600 Jr.]]'s advertisements.

The codebase of the game was later reused to create [[Absolute Entertainment]]'s ''Title Match Pro Wrestling''.<ref name="Retro Gamer">{{cite journal |last=Jainschigg |first=John |title=The History of RealSports |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=183 |date=August 2018 |pages=44–49 |publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref>
