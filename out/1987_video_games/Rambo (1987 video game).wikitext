'''''Rambo''''' is a side-scrolling [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game produced by [[Pack-In-Video]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). It was released on December 4, 1987 in Japan, and May 1988 in North America. It is based on the film ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985). The game sold 600,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Schreiber|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/114182659/newsday-suffolk-edition/|title=Zapping All the way to the bank|newspaper=[[Newsday (Suffolk Edition)|Newsday]]|page=127|date=October 16, 1989|accessdate=December 7, 2022|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
The game starts off with Colonel Trautman asking Rambo whether or not he wants to leave the prison and start the mission. Players are given a choice, but cannot advance in the game unless "yes" is chosen. Players advance through the camp and talk to others, and when talking to Trautman again, he tells Rambo the mission. Rambo then drops into the forest and fights spiders and other forest creatures. Bosses include giant spiders and helicopters. The game has similar gameplay to ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]''. In the Japanese version, the experience meter is replaced by an anger meter; however, it functions exactly the same.

Later in the game, Rambo picks up an arsenal of weapons and fights enemy soldiers.

The  ending sequence allows the player to throw a giant kanji character ([[wiktionary:怒|怒]], ''Ikari'':Anger) towards Murdock after returning to the base, which inexplicably turns Murdock into a frog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flyingomelette.com/oddities/nescrap.html|title=Screwed Up NES Crap|website=www.flyingomelette.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYwl-5gep4w |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/rYwl-5gep4w |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|title=Rambo (NES) Ending|website=[[YouTube]] }}{{cbignore}}</ref>

==Release==
In a 1998 interview, Acclaim co-founder [[Greg Fischbach]] said ''Rambo'' helped bring home to Acclaim the importance of licensing: "I remember having a conversation with a buyer for a large chain of retail stores, and we would bring him titles like ''[[Wizards & Warriors]]'', and he would say, 'No, I don't want it. You bring me a name I recognize and I'll buy your title.' So we brought him ''Rambo'' and he put it in his release schedule. Now, ''Rambo'' was not as good a game as ''Wizards & Warriors'', but that was the way he worked, and we had to deal with that."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=To Hell and Back with Acclaim |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=40|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1998 |page=12}}</ref>
