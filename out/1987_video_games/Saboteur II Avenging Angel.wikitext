'''''Saboteur II: Avenging Angel''''', also known as  '''''Saboteur 2''''', is an [[action-adventure game]] created by Clive Townsend and released by [[Durell Software]] in 1987 for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[MS-DOS]] compatible operating systems. A [[sequel]] to 1985's ''[[Saboteur (1985 video game)|Saboteur]]'', the player controls a sister of Ninja from the first game on a mission to avenge his death. ''Saboteur II'' was one of the first [[action-adventure game]]s with a female [[protagonist]] and was well received by critics.

== Gameplay ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Saboteur II Spectrum Screenshot.gif|thumb|left|upright|A screenshot from the [[ZX Spectrum]] version of the game]] -->

The game starts with a drop into the building from a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]]. Then, while watching out for [[Cougar|pumas]] and robotic guards, the player has to search through the command center for boxes of supplies. Some of the boxes contain one of 14 pieces of punched tape, which on all but the first level must be collected and taken to the [[computer terminal]]. Once this has been achieved, the player must make their way to the bottom centre of the caves, and escape using the [[motorcycle]] which can be found there.<ref name="CRASH_Review">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Crash_No._41_1987-06_Newsfield_GB#page/n101/mode/2up/ |title=Crash - No. 41 (1987-06) (Newsfield) (GB) |date= June 1987|access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref><ref name="YS_Review">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-17/YourSinclair_17_May_1987#page/n90/mode/1up |title=Dark Side: Your Sinclair Magazine: Issue 17 |date=May 1987 |access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref> In all, the site covers over 700 computer screens.<ref name="Inlay">''Saboteur II'' inlay.</ref> There are nine missions of increasing difficulty level (codenamed Rin, Kyo, Toh, Sha, Kai, Jin, Retsu, Zai and Zen), each with more objectives (such as collecting more pieces of [[punched tape]], or having to disable an electrified perimeter fence protecting the tunnel).

The game offers two subtle ways to assist the player. The loading screen shows the compound and a building in the background, which included a pixel dot map representing each screen. There is also a hidden screen containing a glowing crate which would reward the player with infinite energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-maps/s/SaboteurII_2.jpg|format=JPG|title=Owner modified ''Sinclair User'' map showing secret screen|publisher=Ftp.worldofspectrum.org|access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref> This screen is so well hidden it was missed off several maps printed in computer magazines of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue41/Pages/Crash4100050.jpg|format=JPG|title=''CRASH'' map showing secret screen|publisher=Ftp.worldofspectrum.org|access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue065/Pages/SinclairUser06500012.jpg|format=JPG|title=Sinclair User map missing secret screen|publisher=Ftp.worldofspectrum.org|access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue21/Pages/YourSinclair2100050.jpg|format=JPG|title=Your Sinclair map missing secret screen|publisher=Ftp.worldofspectrum.org|access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-maps/s/SaboteurII_4.png|format=PNG|title=Contemporary (2002) map showing secret screen|publisher=Ftp.worldofspectrum.org|access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref>

== Plot ==
The player takes control of a [[kunoichi|female ninja]] named Nina (a sister of Ninja, the deceased hero of the original ''Saboteur''), who must break into a dictator's high-security compound to alter the course of a nuclear ballistic missile and then escape. The enemy's command centre and office complex is being built on top of a mountain filled with tunnels and caverns. An armoury building is on the top left of the mountain, a missile silo is on the top right, while the central top area is still being developed; there is only one way out of the mountain, which is the long entrance tunnel on the bottom left.

== Development and release ==
''Saboteur II'' was one of the first action-adventure games with a female protagonist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-093/ZZap_64_Issue_093_Commodore_Force_Issue_03_1993_Mar#page/n9/mode/1up/ |title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 93 (Commodore Force Issue 03) |date= March 1993|access-date=2014-05-12}}</ref> According to Luke Plunkett of [[Kotaku]], "for a serious game released in 1987, that was kind of a big deal, especially since she wasn't a princess or cartoon character. She was a ninja".<ref>{{cite web|author=Luke Plunkett |url=http://kotaku.com/5857731/whats-cooler-than-sam-fisher-lady-ninjas-motorbikes-and-pumas |title=What's Cooler Than Sam Fisher? Lady Ninjas, Motorbikes and Pumas |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= 9 November 2011|access-date=2014-05-12}}</ref> The game's designer Clive Townsend said it was a conscious decision: "I wanted something original, and it seemed quite different to most other games. It's become acceptable now after ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', but at the time it was a bit strange. Why shouldn't ninja characters be female?"<ref name=rg>''Retro Gamer'' 11, pages 92-93.</ref> Nevertheless, the PC version features a male ninja on the cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/totally-80s-box-art/?page=4 |title=Page 4 - Totally '80s box art! |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2009-05-07 |access-date=2014-05-12}}</ref> Townsend traced the character art for the game's loading screen from an [[erotic magazine]].<ref name=rg/> ''Saboteur II'' itself was supposed to be followed by the cancelled ''Saboteur 3D'' for the ZX Spectrum, which would feature isometric perspective graphics.<ref name=rg/>

Despite the four released formats being different in hardware and programming (the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] notwithstanding), the different versions all looked and played almost identically. Usually, it is almost impossible to tell the difference between the Amstrad CPC, PC and [[Commodore 64]] versions ([[Attribute clash|colour clash]] being the giveaway for the ZX Spectrum version). The game was re-released by Hit-Pak in 1988<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-and-videogames-077/ComputerAndVideoGames_077_Mar_1988#page/n1/mode/2up |title=Computer and Videogames Magazine Issue 077 |date= March 1988|access-date=2014-05-12}}</ref> and by [[Encore, Inc.|Encore]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-052/ZZap_64_Issue_052_1989_Aug#page/n57/mode/1up/ |title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 052 |date= August 1989|access-date=2014-05-12}}</ref> It was also released as a bonus with an issue of ''[[Zzap!64]]'' in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-093/ZZap_64_Issue_093_Commodore_Force_Issue_03_1993_Mar#page/n9/mode/1up/ |title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 93 (Commodore Force Issue 03) |date= March 1993|access-date=2015-11-06}}</ref>

Initial reviews of the game were positive. For instance, Phil South from ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' opined that the game was "a fine sequel, but possibly more important, it's a fine game in its own right. ''Saboteur'' was an original twist on an old platform riff, so that makes ''Sab II'' a double twist with a backflip and a lager chaser!"<ref name="YS_Review" /> When the game was re-released in 1989, ''Your Sinclair'''s Marcus Berkmann wrote that "if it doesn't perhaps hold up too well now, it's still an entertaining enough chase-and-kick 'em up with the novelty of a female hero".<ref name="YS_Review2" />

== Legacy ==
A remake of the game was released in 2019 (32 years after the release of the original game) on [[Steam (service)|Steam]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PS4]], and [[Xbox One]]. It came with a few additions like new graphics, many remixes of the original music, and more information on the lore.

''Deep Cover'' (a ''Saboteur 2'' prequel for the [[ZX Spectrum#ZX Spectrum 128|ZX Spectrum 128]]) won Best Text Adventure at the Planeta Sinclair 'Game of the Year' awards 2021.

Following the release of the remake, two sequels were planned: ''Saboteur SiO'' was released in 2020 and ''Saboteur ZERO'' was slated for a late 2022 release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clivetownsend.com/ |title=Home |website=clivetownsend.com}}</ref>
