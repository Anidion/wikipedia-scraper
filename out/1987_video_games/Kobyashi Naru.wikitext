'''''Kobyashi Naru''''' is a 1987 adventure game by [[Mastertronic]]. The title comes from the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' scenario in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' fictional universe, a training test. The player attempts to complete a series of challenges in order to complete the Kobyashi Naru test. Gameplay is standard for text-based adventures of the era. ''ZZap!64'' summed it up as "harmless claptrap",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-025|title=ZZap!64 Magazine Issue 025|date=1 May 1987|page=62|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> while ''CVG Magazine'' commented on the "extremeley basic" graphics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-068|title=CVG Magazine Issue 068|date=1 June 1987|page=94|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Computer Gamer praised the intuitiveness of the game's parser, as opposed to other games that require a persnickety combination of words.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_25_1987-04_Argus_Press_GB|title=Computer Gamer - Issue 25 (1987-04)(Argus Press)(GB)|date=1 April 1987|page=52|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
