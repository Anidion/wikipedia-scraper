==Gameplay==
[[File:AndyCappTheGameInCourtforFighting.png|left|thumb|For fighting in the game, players get to appear in court and choose whether or not to pay the fine to the judge.]]

Andy has to acquire money to give to his wife from various sources, as he has already spent his unemployment benefit, while consuming as much alcohol as possible and avoid getting arrested for various crimes (like [[Domestic violence|punching his wife]] and beating up police officers).<ref name="mobygames"/> Money is assigned to the player in [[Pound sterling|British pound]]s and kisses are used to control various [[non-player character]]s. Running out of kisses or alcohol means that the game instantly ends with a [[game over]].<ref name="mobygames"/> The time is given in the [[24-hour clock]] format (00:00-23:59 and excluding the AM/PM formats) while the days of the weeks are organized from Monday to Friday.

Players can make Andy either speak or fight.<ref name="mobygames"/> A score is given to reward players for making the right decisions.

The music, [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s [[New World Symphony]], was also used in the iconic 1973 [[Ridley Scott]]-directed [[Television in the United Kingdom|British television]] commercial to advertise ''[[Hovis]]'' bread.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.hardsid.com/s.php?Andy%20Capp%20-%20The%20Game%201d8c| title = Game music information| publisher = Hard Sid| date = | accessdate = 2011-03-21| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719182131/http://www.hardsid.com/s.php?Andy%20Capp%20-%20The%20Game%201d8c| archive-date = 2011-07-19| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/hovis-boy-on-the-bike-tv-advert-dvorak/|title = Hovis 'Boy on the Bike' advert returns to TV with new music – here's a first look}}</ref>
