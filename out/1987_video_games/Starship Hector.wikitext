'''''Starship Hector''''', originally released as {{nihongo|'''''Hector'87'''''|ヘクター'87}},<ref>[http://superfamicom.org/famicom/info/hector-87 Japanese title] at SuperFamicom.org</ref> is a [[scrolling shooter]] developed and published by [[Hudson Soft]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game contains both horizontally and vertically scrolling segments. The player's starship has two modes of fire: one to tackle flying enemies and one for ground-based ones.

''Starship Hector'' is a follow-up to Hudson Soft's earlier shooter ''[[Star Soldier (video game)|Star Soldier]]'', itself inspired by [[Tecmo]]'s ''[[Star Force]]'', an arcade game that Hudson had ported to the [[Famicom]] in 1985. The background music of ''Starship Hector'' was reused as background music in ''[[Super Star Soldier]]''. The theme also appears in the [[Wii]] game ''[[Kororinpa]]'', which itself has many themes from older Hudson Soft games.

The game was released in 1995 for the [[Super Famicom]], along with ''Star Force'' and ''Star Soldier'', in the ''Caravan Shooting Collection'' released exclusively in Japan.
