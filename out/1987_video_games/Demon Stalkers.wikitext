'''''Demon Stalkers: The Raid on Doomfane''''' is an action [[role-playing video game]] released in 1987 for the [[Commodore 64]] and in 1989 for [[IBM PC compatible]]s. The game is a top-down [[dungeon crawl]] about killing monsters during the descent. A sequel, ''[[Fire King (video game)|Fire King]]'', was released for the same systems.

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}

The game can be played in either single player mode or two player co-operative mode, using two joysticks, or a joystick plus keyboard. Players can choose to control either the hero, armed with [[throwing knives]], or the heroine, armed with a [[crossbow]]. During the game, players will find various relics which permanently increase attack power, defense, or magic power, as well as an arsenal of magic scrolls, and special amulets that create temporary effects. Food can be picked up to heal damage, but occasionally turns out to be poison which hurts the player. Similarly, some scrolls turn out to be a "slow death curse," which takes a way the player's health continuously until death, unless the exit from that level is found. Enemies in the game include rats, ghosts who can walk through walls, dervishes who can steal a player's possessions, snappers who remain dormant until disturbed, and mad mages, who shoot fireballs. These monsters emerge from special spawning areas called vortexes, which can be destroyed by the player with several shots, except for the rats, who emerge from indestructible sewer grates.

The dungeon consists of many interconnected [[maze]]-like levels which rooms, hallways, and doors. There are several multi-level mazes, where the player must ascend and descend between levels several times before finding the correct path. The collecting of keys to open doors is a fundamental part of the game, while fighting against a horde of monsters. Most of the levels entail some sort of [[puzzle]] solving, involving clues in the form of scrolls that are picked up along the way. These scrolls also tell the story of an unsuccessful group of adventurers who journeyed through the dungeon before the current players. This ill-fated party included members Arthur, Bloodaxe, Grindlewald, Furrowfoot, and Imelda, as well as Mellack, a mage whom the previous adventurers met along the way. Correctly answering some questions after each story section yields bonus health points.

Level 100 is unique in the game, as its geography includes large, irregularly shaped caves, rather than straight or diagonal walls as in the other levels. Level 100 also only features one enemy, the demon [[Boss (video games)|boss]], Calvrak. ''Demon Stalkers'' includes its own level-editor, allowing the player to modify all levels except 100.

==Reception==
A review in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', comparing the game to ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'', noted "''Gauntlet'' seemed to have ten times more monsters than ''Demon Stalkers''. Thus, despite the similarities, ''Gauntlet'' is primarily an action game and ''Demon Stalkers'' is a search game with action thrown in."<ref name = "CGW">{{citation | date = April 1988 | last = Choi | first = Yung Min | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Ramparts and Rodents: A Look at Two Action Adventure Dungeons | pages = 40–41}}</ref> The review concluded by saying neither game would disappoint.<ref name = "CGW"/>
