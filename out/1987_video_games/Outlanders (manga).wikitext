{{nihongo|'''''Outlanders'''''|アウトランダーズ|Autorandāzu}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Johji Manabe]]. The story follows the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] Kahm, crown princess of the interstellar Santovasku Empire, who invades Earth and meets and falls in love with human news photographer Tetsuya Wakatsuki. The couple and their allies soon find themselves caught in a war between Earth's military, the Santovasku invasion forces, and an ancient clan seeking vengeance on the Santovasku. ''Outlanders'' is largely a [[space opera]] series that combines aspects of [[science fantasy]], [[Romance comics|romance]], comedy, and [[fan service]].

''Outlanders'' was created out of Manabe's desire to try his hand the space opera genre. He was driven by his penchant for illustrating attractive, sword-wielding girls and large, detailed [[starship|spacecraft]], as well as his interest in science fiction epics such as the original [[Star Wars original trilogy|''Star Wars'' Trilogy]]. ''Outlanders'' was Manabe's first serialized work and was featured in the [[Hakusensha]] manga magazine ''Monthly ComiComi'' between January 1985 and November 1987.

Individual chapters of ''Outlanders'' were collected and sold as eight ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes in Japan during its publication in ''Monthly ComiComi''. The series spawned an [[anime]] adaptation in the form of an [[original video animation]] (OVA) by [[Tatsunoko Production]], released in Japan in December 1986. The manga was translated into English by [[Toren Smith]] of [[Studio Proteus]] and licensed in North America by [[Dark Horse Comics]] beginning in 1988 as one of its earliest manga properties. The OVA received two English dubs: the first from [[U.S. Renditions]] in 1993 and the second from [[Central Park Media]] (CPM) in 2006. Critical reaction to the anime has been largely mixed regarding its tone, animation, and sound design, though many agreed that the adaptation condenses too much of the manga's plot.

==Plot==
''Outlanders'' begins in modern day Tokyo with the arrival of a Biomech, a giant, organic [[starship]] that easily destroys several [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Japanese Self-Defense Force]] (JSDF) helicopters. News photographer Tetsuya Wakatsuki comes face-to-face with the craft's occupant Kahm, crown princess of the technologically advanced, interstellar Santovasku Empire. She charges him, he manages to fend her off, and she retreats without her sword. Kahm's father, Emperor Quevas, is informed that the Santovaskuan "sacred planet" is infested with humans while the JSDF supreme commander Togo prepares for an impending war with the alien invaders. Battia Bureitin Rou, a Santovasku fleet commander and Kahm's best friend, is sent to retrieve the princess when she returns to the city in search of her sword. During a skirmish with the humans, Battia's ship takes heavy damage, which triggers the Biomech's [[self-destruct]] mechanism. Having found her sword and Tetsuya in his apartment, Kahm receives a warning from Battia and evacuates with Tetsuya as the entire [[Japanese archipelago]] is vaporized. Meanwhile, Tetsuya's boss, Aki Okazawa, is taken to [[Siberia]] by the JSDF. There she meets Neo, Togo's superior and the leader of the secret world political organization known as the Shadow Cabinet. He exposits that millions of years earlier Earth was the seat of the Ra Empire, torn apart in a civil war between two belligerants: the Yoma Clan and the progenitors of the current Santovasku Empire. Neo, himself a surviving Yoma from this conflict, tells Aki that her body houses the spirit of the Yoma witch Jilehr Maruda and that he wishes to utilize her immense power to exact revenge on the Santovasku. Shortly thereafter, Quevas gives the order for all human life to be exterminated, resulting in large portions Europe being bombarded by the empire. Neo awakens Jilehr within Aki and the assaulting platoon is instantly obliterated by her magic.

Tetsuya hears of Japan's fate and forces Kahm to return him to Earth. The two crash land in Germany and meet scavenger Raisa Vogel. They evade capture by German troops and Raisa splits off on her own. Kahm and Tetsuya discuss marrying to create a diplomatic alliance between the humans and Santovasku. The couple rendezvous with Kahm's Nuba Tribe servants, use her crashed ship's communicator to call for extraction, and set a course for the Santovasku imperial home world. Battia joins them. Kahm tells her she is denouncing her father's intention of [[arranged marriage|arranging her marriage]] to produce a royal heir and is strategically marrying Tetsuya to stop the war. Once arriving and making their case, an unconvinced Quevas has Tetsuya arrested and sentences him to death then puts Kahm under [[house arrest]]. With the aid of Battia and the Nuba, they manage to escape and head for Earth again in hopes of gaining support from its military to fight the empire instead. Realizing their affection for one another has grown, Kahm and Tetsuya still intend to wed. Upon reaching Earth's orbit, Kahm pleads with empire affiliate Geobaldi to join their efforts, which he does following a duel with Tetsuya. Neo continues to groom Jilehr in exacting vengeance on the Santovasku. Togo, now the head of Earth's global armed forces, plots against the Yoma so that humanity alone may ultimately triumph so that he can achieve his own ambitions of galactic conquest.

The rebels land on Earth, reunite with Raisa, and have brief diplomatic talks with Togo before leaving. Togo then has Neo gunned down and initiates Operation Phoenix. This unveils the Earth's [[moon]] as an enormous weapon called Dola, which was built by the Ra Empire eons ago. Raisa and Aki both join the rebels and take part in Kahm and Tetsuya's wedding. The festivities are cut short when an imperial army group is sent to their location by Quevas to demolish Earth for Kahm's continued defiance. A large battle between the Santovasku and rebel squadron ensues. Aki becomes Jilehr once more and takes control of the rebel vessels while Togo gives the command to have Dola strike the battlefield frontlines. A substantial percentage of the Santovasku fleet is vanquished, but as Togo's team celebrates they receive a taunting call from Jilehr. Realizing the sorceress survived the initial blast, Togo desperately demands another to eliminate her. However, the humans lose control of the ancient weapon to Jilehr as she sets it on a collision course with Earth. After madly proclaiming his aspirations to rule the galaxy, the selfish Togo is assassinated by one of his officers just as Dola and planet impact, [[human extinction|wiping out humanity]].

The protagonists find that they have warped to the outskirts of the Santovasku imperial planet. Jilehr shows herself again, this time surrounded by the vengeful ghosts of the Yoma Clan. Jilehr causes the rebel Biomechs to fire on the planet, prompting Quevas to engage with her in a fierce battle of magic. Before the Yoma spirits succumb to the emperor's overwhelming abilities, Aki breaks free of Jilehr's hold and dies. Quevas subsequently appears aboard Kahm's spacecraft. He reveals his initial plan to reclaim Earth was to ensure the Yoma's eradication. He then teleports with his daughter to the planet's imperial palace. With Jilehr gone, the rebels regain control of their warships and breach the planet's defenses to rescue Kahm once more. Battia, Geobaldi, and Raisa all sacrifice their lives so that Tetsuya can reach the palace. Tetsuya proceeds to the royal throne room and is confronted by a hostile Kahm. With no memory of her husband due to the influence of her father's [[Brainwashing|mind control]], she attacks Tetsuya only to come to her senses moments later. A final confrontation between Quevas and Kahm ends with the princess fatally wounding the emperor with a sword stab. His death brings with it the destruction of the imperial planet and the Santovasku Empire. Kahm and Tetsuya manage to depart with the Nuba just as the planet explodes. Three years later, they have happily settled on the peaceful planet Ekoda. Now with [[Multiple birth#Quintuplets|quintuplet]] daughters and one son, Kahm and Tetsuya receive a visit from the souls of their deceased friends during an annual festival.

:The human main protagonist, and a young photographer for the newspaper agency Toa News. Originally self-conscious and timid, he grows in courage and willpower during the war, mainly when he falls in love with Kahm, and takes up the fight against the Santovasku Empire.

;{{nihongo|Princess Kahm|カーム|Kāmu}}
:The story's alien main protagonist, and the impulsive crown princess of the Santovasku Empire. She originally came to Earth to escape her confined life in the imperial palace and find adventure and excitement in battle. After first attempting to kill Tetsuya, she falls in love with him, compelling her into helping him defend the Earth against her father's predations.

;{{nihongo|Battia Bureitin Rou|バティア・ブレイティン・ロウ|Batia Bureitin Rō}} 
:A [[catgirl]] officer in the Santovasku Empire, Kahm's minder and best friend, and Geobaldi's lover. She is a swordswoman of extraordinary skill. She dies during Tetsuya's assault on the Imperial palace to rescue Kahm from her father, although her spirit returns in the manga's epilogue as part of a special holiday (on which the living are allowed to spend one day each year with dear departed friends and family) on the planet on which Tetsuya and Kahm have settled.

;{{nihongo|Geobaldi|ゲオバルディ|Geobarudi}} 
:An immensely strong soldier and a member of the Gadom, a primitive bear-man people which were all but eradicated by the Santovasku Empire. The few survivors were drafted as battle fodder into the imperial forces; Geobaldi has risen to the rank of commander over their forces.

Despite her bossy nature, she deeply cares for Tetsuya, and it is this affection which allows her to rid herself of Jilehr's spirit, although the strain kills her. Like Battia and Geobaldi, she appears again as a spirit in the manga's epilogue chapter.

;{{nihongo|Raisa Vogel|ライザ・フォーゲル|Raiza Fōgeru}}
:A young German girl who lost her family during the first wave of the Santovasku invasion, she encounters Tetsuya and Kahm when the alien princess first returns him to Earth.

He initiates the invasion of Earth solely to eradicate Neo, the last survivor of the Yoma Clan who poses a threat to his life. When Tetsuya invades the imperial palace to rescue Kahm, and she sees him injured, she shakes off the mind control and mortally wounds her father, thereby triggering the utter destruction of the empire.

;{{nihongo|Togo|東郷|Togo}} 
:The supreme commander of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Japanese Self-Defense Force]]. On the surface the leader of Earth's defenses against the aliens, he is actually a member of the Shadow Cabinet, a small group of Earth people who are aware of Neo's origins and are working hand in hand with his goals to destroy the empire. Secretly, however, he schemes to take control of Earth for himself, manipulating Giru and even Jilehr to this end; but Jilehr, unwilling to be dominated, eventually turns against him. Just before Jilehr wipes out the rest of humanity by causing the Moon to crash into the Earth, Togo is killed by one of his underlings when his megalomania turns into desperate ruthlessness.

;{{nihongo|Neo|ネオ|Neo}}
:An ancient sorcerer of the alien Yoma Clan who has kept himself alive for centuries [[Life support|with the use of life-sustaining machines]].

;{{nihongo|Masato Hagiwara|萩原|Hagiwara Masato}} / {{nihongo|Giru|ギル|Giru}}
:A JSDF captain and Aki's ex-boyfriend, he is actually Neo's familiar, a raven bestowed with sentience and speech capability who was temporarily shapechanged into a human form.

;{{nihongo|Gelvas|ゲルバス|Gerubasu}} 
:The head bishop of the Santovasku Empire. While loyal to the emperor, he is a much more level-headed man and sympathetic towards Kahm and Tetsuya's relationship. He remains behind and is killed when the imperial homeworld self-destructs upon the emperor's death.

;{{nihongo|Progresso|プログレス|Puroguresu}}
:A first officer and admiral of the Santovasku Empire. He is given the task of exterminating humanity after Battia is relieved of her command by the emperor. He dies during an assault on Europe when Jilehr uses her magic to destroy his fleet of motherships.

==Production==
''Outlanders'' was written and illustrated by [[Johji Manabe]].

Manabe felt he had been given ample time to conceptualize and frame the narrative. ''Outlanders'' was his first attempt at [[space opera]], a genre of which he had long been a fan. The author took inspiration from numerous science fiction properties, specifically the original [[Star Wars original trilogy|''Star Wars'' Trilogy]], the [[Lensman series|''Lensman'' series]], and [[Flash Gordon]].<ref name="introduction"/><ref name="mangazine"/> His editors requested "an action story full of monsters, mayhem, and destruction."<ref name="manabespeaks">{{cite book | author=[[Johji Manabe|Manabe Johji]] | date=December 1, 1989 | title=Outlanders | volume=1 | publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]] | chapter=Manabe Speaks | isbn=1-56971-161-5}}</ref> This is partly reflected in the manga's earlier chapters, which showcase considerable more violence than its remainder.<ref name="mangazine"/> However, because Manabe was not very fond of monsters, he compromised by creating the living, Biomech warships.<ref name="manabespeaks"/> He did not initially plan for the crafts to be biological organsims. For instance, one imperial battleship began as an altered ''[[Macross]]'' spacecraft before several redesigns gave it an increasingly organic appearance.<ref name="makingof">{{cite book | author=[[Johji Manabe|Manabe Johji]] | date=December 1, 1989 | title=Outlanders | volume=1 | publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]] | chapter=The Making of ''Outlanders'' | isbn=1-56971-161-5}}</ref> Manabe simplified writing the plot as a war between Earth and the Santovasku Empire that would end with one winner and one loser, but did have some difficulty with getting the conflicts within each faction to "mesh."<ref name="manabespeaks"/> Regarding the characters, Manabe found it challenging to develop each one's complex personality, so he "pretty much let them do their own thing" and "decided they could play their own roles as they pleased."<ref name="manabespeaks"/> Kahm was the first character Manabe proposed for the editors, basing her art design on a sketch from his design school days.<ref name="makingof"/> As he lacked experience in clothing design prior to ''Outlanders'', he remarked that "getting the characters and the Santovasku Army suited up was a real nightmare."<ref name="manabespeaks"/>

At some point during the serialization of ''Outlanders'', Manabe moved to Tokyo, opened his own manga studio, and hired full-time [[Mangaka#assistants|assistants]] to focus more on its production. Throughout its run, he wrote several related stories set in the ''Outlanders'' universe.<ref name="mangazine"/> A prequel chapter titled {{nihongo|''The Key of Graciale''|グラシェールの鍵|Gurashēru no Kagi}} was featured in the January 1986 issue of ''Monthly ComiComi''.<ref>{{cite magazine | author=[[Johji Manabe|Manabe Johji]] | date=January 1986 | title=グラシェールの鍵 | trans-title=The Key of Graciale | magazine=Comicomi Magazine | publisher=[[Hakusensha]] | language=Japanese | page=11 | url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CtLvVtMUIAAFWGZ.jpg | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210527091338/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CtLvVtMUIAAFWGZ.jpg | archive-date=May 27, 2021 | access-date=May 1, 2021 | url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Outlanders'' was adapted into an [[anime]] [[original video animation|OVA]] by [[Tatsunoko Production]] for a December 1986 release.<ref>{{cite web | title=Works | url=https://tatsunoko.co.jp/works/outlanders | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119110237/https://tatsunoko.co.jp/works/outlanders | archive-date=January 19, 2021 | language=Japanese | publisher=[[Tatsunoko Production]] | accessdate=March 19, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | date=January 1987 | title=News & Newtype: Video Soft | magazine=[[Newtype]] | publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]] | volume=2 | issue=1 | page=165 | language=Japanese}}</ref> It was directed by Katsuhisa Yamada; was written by [[Kenji Terada]] and [[Sukehiro Tomita]]; and featured music composed by Kei Wakakusa.<ref name="annreview">{{cite web | author=Martin, Theron | date=January 23, 2006 | title=Review: ''Outlanders'' DVD | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/outlanders/dvd | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526081840/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/outlanders/dvd | archive-date=May 26, 2019 | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | accessdate=March 1, 2021}}</ref><ref name="animeencyclopedia">{{cite book |author1=[[Jonathan Clements|Clements, Jonathan]] |author2=[[Helen McCarthy|McCarthy, Helen]] | date=March 3, 2015 | title=[[The Anime Encyclopedia]] | publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]] | page=661 | edition=3rd | isbn=978-1-61172-018-1}}</ref> The anime condenses roughly the first half of the manga into a single 48-minute episode.

==Reception==
Although sales and print circulation numbers have not been made widely available, ''Outlanders'' enjoyed commercial success in Japan to a degree that author [[Johji Manabe]] was able to open his own studio and employ assistants during its publication.<ref name="mangazine"/> In 1992, Dark Horse manga editor John Weeks described the English localization of ''Outlanders'' as "very successful".<ref name="newswatch"/> [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] critiqued the series in ''[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]'' as "a star-spanning epic adventure that gradually morphs into a drippy love story." He was impressed with the creative choices Manabe made with its action and science fiction elements early in the manga, but disliked how the series became increasingly more centered on the evolving romantic subplot between its two main protagonists.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Jason Thompson (writer)|Thompson, Jason]] | date=October 9, 2007 | title=[[Manga: The Complete Guide]] | publisher=[[Del Rey Books]] | isbn=978-0-345-48590-8 | pages=261–2}}</ref>

The ''Outlanders'' VHS from Dark Image Entertainment was the third-best selling anime for the month of November 1993 according to [[Capital City Distribution]].<ref>{{cite magazine | date=December 1993 | title=Video Clips: America's Top Sellers | magazine=[[Animerica]] | publisher=[[Viz Media]] | volume=1 | issue=10 | page=15 | issn=1067-0831}}</ref> Critical reception for the ''Outlanders'' OVA has been mixed. Reviewers saw the plot as a standard yet light-hearted science fiction epic with large amounts of [[fan service]] and casual use of graphic violence, though views on its execution varied. ''[[The Anime Encyclopedia]]'' authors [[Jonathan Clements]] and [[Helen McCarthy]] found the story presented "considerable charm despite a fairly high violence quotient."<ref name="animeencyclopedia"/> [[Anime News Network]] contributor Theron Martin noted it as "quite a bit more sexy and violent than the norm" and "a fun romp which does not concern itself with weighty matters like originality, cohesiveness, or logic."<ref name="annreview"/> Animefringe writer Joseph Luscik praised the anime's comedy and entertainment variety despite its short length and that "it cannot be considered a masterpiece of the genre."<ref name="fringe">{{cite web |url=http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/12/feature/04.php | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023091249/http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/12/feature/04.php | archive-date=October 23, 2019 | title=A Classic Revisited |access-date=February 21, 2021 |author=Luscik, Joseph |date=December 2005 |publisher=Anime Fringe}}</ref> Samuel Arbogast of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews was much more negative and noted, "There's not quite enough violence to appease carnage aficionados, there isn't any romance to appease the romantics, and there isn't anything beyond some rather pointless nudity to appease the perverts."<ref name="themreviews">{{cite web | author=Arbogast, Samuel | title=''Outlanders'' | url=http://themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=718 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128202147/http://themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=718 | archive-date=November 28, 2020 | publisher=T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews | accessdate=March 8, 2021}}</ref> Both Martin and Arbogast objected to the condensed nature of the OVA's narrative and its fast pacing, stating that knowledge of the manga would be a prerequisite to enjoying or understanding it.<ref name="annreview"/><ref name="themreviews"/> Martin summarized, "The lack of adequate explanation for several key story elements also suggests that it was made specifically for fans of the manga, as newcomers to the franchise will be left scratching their heads over certain events."<ref name="annreview"/> Arbogast claimed the plot of ''Outlanders'' to be a [[plagiarism]] of the manga and anime series ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'', which also centers around the romance between a lecherous, human male and a scantifly-clad, alien female that starts when the latter's race attempts to invade Earth.<ref name="themreviews"/> Clements and McCarthy merely saw these similarities as "affectionate nods."<ref name="animeencyclopedia"/> Arbogast called the characters "badly lacking" and was particularly critical of its two leads, Tetsuya and Kahm, who fall in love but "have nothing in common other than that they're both young and stupid."<ref name="themreviews"/> Luscik saw the mutual attraction between the protagonists as refreshing when opposed to the one-sided affection found in some other anime.<ref name="fringe"/>

Opinions on the technical aspects of the ''Outlanders'' OVA were also mixed. While Martin saw the art style and character designs as typical for its release mid-1980s era, he found fault with its animation. He stated that its slow [[frame rate]] made many of the movements "clunky" and outlined, "The action is staged well enough that the visual effect is passable as long as one doesn't dwell on the details, but this isn't a title that's going to win any technical awards."<ref name="annreview"/> Arbogast complimented the background art as "nicely detailed", but viewed the animation as poor overall, particularly its fight sequences and scenes involving nudity, surmising that it would inexcusable had it been released only a few years later.<ref name="themreviews"/> The reviewer was equally unimpressed with the sound design including its background music, ending vocal theme, and the voice acting for the L.A. Hero English dub.<ref name="themreviews"/> Martin commented on the ending theme as a "guitar-heavy rock number typical of '80s musical trends" and its background musical score as sounding appropriately inspired by American science fiction media like ''[[Star Trek]]''.<ref name="annreview"/> Both Martin and Luscik praised the talent and delivery of the CPM dub performers and recognized that the licensor's allowance of fans to elect voice actors by vote would likely curb most criticism of their casting.<ref name="fringe"/><ref name="annreview"/> However, Martin downgraded the dub portion of his review due to the newer script altering the meaning of certain lines of the Japanese dialogue and unnecessarily adding in others for comedic effect.<ref name="annreview"/> Luscik contrarily appreciated these changes, stating, "There will be zero complaints here, since you spend most of the movie laughing at the witty script."<ref name="fringe"/>
