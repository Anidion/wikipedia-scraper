'''Apache Strike''' is a 3D helicopter game first released for the [[Macintosh]] in 1987.

==Gameplay==
Its objective is flying an [[Apache helicopter]] through a rudimentary [[hidden line removal|hidden line]]-rendered cityscape in order to destroy the enemy's strategic defense computer. Enemy helicopters and tanks are encountered and must be shot down along the way. <!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Apache_Strike-screen.png|thumb|left]] --> The Apache's position is shown in an onscreen map as well as bearing and distance to the defense computer. Some game events are presented in digitized speech by the Lifelike In-board Narrative Damage Assessment computer, or LINDA.

The intro music bears more than a passing resemblance to the ''[[Airwolf]]'' helicopter TV series theme.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

==Reception==
''[[Compute!]]'' in 1989 called the PC version of ''Apache Strike''{{'}}s graphics "sparse but colorful", noting that it was among the few inexpensive games supporting [[VGA graphics]]. The magazine recommended the game to those who "just want to blow some bad guys out of the sky without having to think too hard".<ref name="atkin198912">{{Cite magazine |last=Atkin |first=Denny |date=December 1989 |title=Apache Strike |url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_115_1989_Dec#page/n109/mode/2up |magazine=Compute! |page=108}}</ref>
