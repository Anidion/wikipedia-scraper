'''''The Fool's Errand''''' is a 1987 [[computer game]] by [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]]. It is a [[meta-puzzle]] game with storytelling, visual puzzles, and a cryptic [[treasure map]]. It is the tale of a wandering Fool who seeks his fortune in the Land of [[Tarot]] and braves the enchantments of the High Priestess. A sequel titled ''[[The Fool and His Money]]'' was released October 25, 2012.

== Plot ==
The plot focuses on The Fool card of the tarot, who is portrayed as a silhouette of a young man wearing a peaked, feathered cap, curled-toed shoes, and carrying a knapsack on a stick. The Fool is the protagonist of the story, and he encounters various other cards from the tarot. In the beginning of the story, The Sun gives him a map, which has been scrambled, and directs him to find the "Lost 14 Treasures of the World." The Fool journeys through four kingdoms (each representing a suit from the minor arcana of the tarot), where he encounters other characters, who either give him more information or provide him with additional tasks. The High Priestess card of the tarot is set up as the villain of the story, and all the characters he meets are other cards from the tarot. Each character is drawn as a black silhouette, as is the background art.

== Gameplay ==
The game is structured as a storybook divided into five parts, each containing a large number of different chapters; the storybook can be paged through and read as continuous prose on screen. However, not every chapter is available at the start of the game, and those chapters which are available are not consecutive. Many chapters have a puzzle (called an ''enchantment'') associated with them; completing such a puzzle unlocks further chapter(s). Every chapter is named after a tarot card in either the [[Major Arcana]] or the [[Minor Arcana]].

Frequently, the puzzles are designed in such a way that the result of the puzzle leads logically into the unlocked chapter; for example, the player may complete an ''[[Acrostic (puzzle)|acrostic puzzle]]'' which results in the phrase "No Ship", which then unlocks part of the story in which a watchman indeed reports that no ship has been sighted and deals with the consequences. Other puzzles feature pictures which portray parts of the story or even clues to other puzzles.

[[Image:Fool'sErrand-MacSun'sMap.png|thumb|right|The Sun's Map in the Macintosh version]]The first chapter, ''The Sun'', features the puzzle ''The Sun's Map''. This is a jigsaw puzzle with one piece for every chapter in the story; each puzzle piece appears only when the appropriate chapter is unlocked. Each piece contains a symbol representing the chapter from which it came, plus part of a continuous path which flows through all pieces in the order in which they are mentioned in the narrative.  Once the map is successfully completed, other designs on the map become active click targets and can be used as clues or processes to decipher the true final puzzle: ''The Book Of Thoth'', hidden within the chapter ''The High Priestess'', which requires the reader to peruse the entire story as continuous prose and identify a number of phrases hidden within the narrative.

==Development==
[[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]], who at that point had worked as a filmmaker, was inspired by films like ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'' and ''[[The Last of Sheila]]'' which included puzzle-mysteries for the viewer to solve; he aimed to host "mystery" dinner parties where players would uncover clues to find the hidden secrets.

The 1979 work ''[[Masquerade (book)|Masquerade]]'' by [[Kit Williams]] served as further inspiration.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/10/column_beyond_tetris_the_fools.php|title=GameSetWatch COLUMN: 'Beyond Tetris' - The Fool's Errand|website=www.gamesetwatch.com|access-date=2019-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111223401/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/10/column_beyond_tetris_the_fools.php |archive-date=2019-01-11}}</ref> The final chapter of the picture book revealed that the protagonist bunny had lost his treasure, and dared the reader to uncover the clues throughout the book to work out where on Earth it is located; this book sold over 2 million copies and while Johnson was not personally enamoured by the work he felt the idea behind it was exciting.<ref name="maher20151120" />

Johnson decided to create a similar work which he would distribute to his friends as a 1984 Christmas present. The concept, a series of puzzles and a narrative that fit together into an overarching mystery like a jigsaw, was an early incarnation of what became ''The Fool's Errand''. Having recently purchased his first PC, a Macintosh, Johnson began coding the game in 1985.<ref name=":0" /> He learned to program specifically to bring the idea to the interactive entertainment format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fools-errand.com/$articles/CJ-2012-JAE.htm|title=Just Adventure 2012|website=fools-errand.com|access-date=2023-04-29}}</ref> His goal was to “make the experience pleasant and solvable in a single afternoon.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techraptor.net/content/games-never-heard-fools-errand|title=Gaming Obscura: The Fool's Errand|date=2015-04-02|website=Gaming News, Reviews, and Articles - TechRaptor.net|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref> His initial approach to programming was guided by his experience making animated film, which involved "a very tedious frame-by-frame process", creating a blueprint and putting the pieces together to assemble the whole picture in a manner similar to a jigsaw puzzle.<ref>{{cite journal | title=This Little Game Went to Market |journal= [[Macworld]] |last1=Hahn |first1=Rob |date=March 1988 |publisher=[[PC World Communications|PCW Communications, Inc.]] |page=117 |volume=5 |number=3 }}</ref>

Johnson took out a $50,000 loan to finance the project himself, and he had a nervous breakdown during development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/column-playing-catch-up-i-the-fool-s-errand-i-s-cliff-johnson-|title=Column: 'Playing Catch Up: The Fool's Errand's Cliff Johnson'|last=Wallis|first=Alistair|date=October 5, 2006|access-date=2023-04-29}}</ref> By 1986 he had created over 30 individual data-driven programs, which he then had to convert into one application on ''ZBasic.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fools-errand.com/01-CJ/index.htm|title=Sea Jay|website=fools-errand.com|access-date=2023-04-29}}</ref>

== Release ==
''The Fool's Errand'' was released in 1987 by Miles Publishing.<ref name=":0" /> The game saw slow sales initially, but, as positive reviews began to be published, more customers purchased the title. [[Electronic Arts]] took over the distribution, and it was ported to many other consoles. The game was also circulated illegally on file-sharing sites for many years.<ref name=":0" />

Created with [[Microsoft BASIC]] and [[ZBasic]] for the [[Apple Macintosh]], the game was ported to [[MS-DOS]], Commodore [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]].<ref name="maher20151120">{{Cite web |url=https://www.filfre.net/2015/11/cliff-johnsons-fools-errand/ |title=Cliff Johnson's Fool's Errand |last=Maher |first=Jimmy |date=2015-11-20 |website=The Digital Antiquarian}}</ref> The [[Porting|ports]] add color, but in a lower [[Display resolution|resolution]] (320×200, as opposed to the original version's 512×342).

Johnson advises PC-based players to download the Macintosh version and play using a Macintosh [[emulator]]. The non-Macintosh versions of the game were protected by a symbol-based [[code wheel]]. The free version currently offered by the author has this mechanism disabled: the challenge screen still appears, but any answer is accepted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

== Reception ==
''The Fool's Errand'' did not sell well at first, but after a very positive July 1988 review in ''[[MacUser]]'' it became very successful, causing Miles Computing to port the game to other platforms. 100,000 copies were sold by the end of 1989.{{r|maher20151120}} The ''MacUser'' review gave the game five out of five mice, saying it "goes beyond being 'just' an excellent game" and "ventures into the realm of myth, into the prototypical lands of the epic legend, into the maelstrom of the [[Jungian archetype]], and it returns to our world and offers us a way to extend ourselves beyond the boundaries of our normal existence."<ref>{{cite journal |pages=17–19 |title=The Fool's Errand |journal=[[MacUser]] |date=July 1988 |volume=4 |number=7 |publisher=[[Ziff-Davis Publishing Co.]] |last=Shapiro |first=Neil L. }}</ref> In December 1989, ''MacUser'' named ''The Fool's Errand'' one of the 27 best games available for the Macintosh.<ref>{{cite journal |page=140 |title=''MacUser'' Best 27 Games |journal=[[MacUser]] |date=December 1989 |volume=5 |number=12 |publisher=[[Ziff-Davis Publishing Co.]] }}</ref>
