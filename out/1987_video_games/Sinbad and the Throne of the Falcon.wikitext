*The Cyclops - Occasionally, when in remote areas, a cyclops will raid the camp and steal away some of the player's crew. Using a slingshot, the player has to blind the cyclops while avoiding the rocks thrown at him.

*The Earthquake - Sinbad falls into an opening chasm in the earth, and must escape in this quite typical [[platform game|platform]] sequence.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that the Amiga version of ''Sinbad and the Throne of the Falcon'' was a "brilliant tribute to those masterful films. Unfortunately, ''STF'' is also a very uneven product". It praised the audio and some of the graphics but said that the game's attempt to combine arcade, adventure, and strategy was not completely successful, and concluded that it was "light, entertainment fare, at best".{{r|lee198707}}
