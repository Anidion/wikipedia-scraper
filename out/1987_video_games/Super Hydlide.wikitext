'''''Super Hydlide''''' is an [[action role-playing game]] for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]]. It was originally released in 1987 in Japan only under the title {{nihongo|'''''Hydlide 3: The Space Memories'''''|ハイドライド３ 異次元の思い出|Haidoraido 3: I Jigen No Omoide}} for the [[MSX]], [[MSX2]], and [[PC-8800 series|PC-8801mkII SR]]. It's the third game in the ''[[Hydlide]]'' series. Ports were also released for the [[Sharp X1|X1]], [[Nintendo Famicom|Famicom]], [[Sharp X68000|X68000]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Nintendo Switch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/games/news/9910/06/news02.html|title=「ハイドライド3 Gold Pack」11月26日発売。Tシャツも5名に|language=Japanese|date=6 October 1999|access-date=9 September 2022|archive-date=9 September 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220909184349/https://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/games/news/9910/06/news02.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The game was developed by ''Hydlide'' series veterans [[Technology and Entertainment Software|T&E Soft]] and released worldwide on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive on October 6, 1989, in Japan, early 1990 in the United States, and 1991 in Europe. This [[Video game remake|remake]] evidences substantial graphical upgrades to the original ''Hydlide 3'', though the gameplay remains largely identical.<ref name=Kalata/> Before its release, it was called ''Hollo Fighter'' in some [[Sega]] advertising material and was one of the first third party published titles to be released in the U.S, the other being ''[[Air Diver]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Story==
Many years after the events of ''Hydlide II'', an explosion of flames appeared near The City of the Woods. After that, monsters spread throughout the world. A young man is chosen to find the source of the evil.

==Gameplay==
The game incorporates a 'good/evil character' morality/[[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]] system. Like its predecessor ''[[Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness]]'' (1985), the player has a morality meter that can be aligned with either Justice, Normal, or Evil. The game has both good and evil monsters. Evil monsters attack the player character on sight, while good monsters only attack if the player character attacks them first. Killing any monster, good or evil, results in a reward of [[experience point]]s, money, and occasionally a piece of equipment. However, if the player kills a good monster, points are lost from a [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistic]] called "MF" (Moral Fiber). If the player's MF stat drops to zero, frequent traps will appear across the world. If the player manages to keep it over 100, rewards appear in the form of random items found around Fairyland. Unlike ''Hydlide II'', the morality meter no longer affects the way in which the townsfolk react to the player.<ref name=Kalata>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/super-hydlide/|title=Super Hydlide|last=Greene|first=Robert|date=28 February 2012|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=9 September 2022|archive-date=24 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220624171135/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/super-hydlide/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The game also features an in-game clock setting day-night cycles, where the character must eat two times a day and sleep regularly. If the characters stay up late or fail to eat regularly, their [[Health (gaming)|HP]] and attack power gradually drop. Every item in the game (including money) has weight. If the total weight of items the player character carries exceeds their "Load Capacity" (LC), they will move slowly. The game uses [[cut scene]]s for its opening and ending sequences, a combat system similar to ''[[Ys (series)|Ys]]'', a choice between four distinct character classes, and a wide variety of equipment and spells.

==Reception==
''[[GamePro]]'' gave a positive review, citing the varied experiences offered by the different playable characters, the morality system, and the inclusion of four [[Saved game|save slots]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Genesis ProView: Super Hydlide|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=21|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1990|pages=66–67}}</ref>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' scored it 81%, stating that, like ''[[Phantasy Star II]]'', "this is a huge [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]]", and that it is "a very tough game" in which requires a strategy. They criticized the graphics and sound, but were positive to the gameplay. They recommended it to those who like games with steady pace and puzzles despite lacking the action.

== Legacy ==
In 2007, Alex Lucard of Diehard GameFan listed ''Super Hydlide'' at number 27 in his list of [[List of video games considered the best|top 30 RPGs]]. He cited the realism instilled by gameplay mechanics such as the encumbrance system, banks, the 24-hour clock, and the need to eat and sleep, and described the game as "''[[Morrowind]]'' before there was ''Morrowind''".<ref>{{cite web|last=Lucard |first=Alex|title=The Top 30 RPG Countdown|url=http://diehardgamefan.com/2007/07/12/68802/|website=Diehard GameFan|access-date=28 June 2015|date=July 12, 2007}}</ref>

During production of ''[[Scalebound]]'', [[PlatinumGames]] director [[Hideki Kamiya]] said he was inspired by ''Hydlide 3'' on the [[PC-8801|PC-8801 MA]] as well as ''[[Sorcerian]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/a/life-in-japan/Hideki-Kamiya-Scalebound|title=Hideki Kamiya: Making Scalebound with a Western publisher &#124; Life in Japan — an 18-part look inside Japan's game industry|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-08-07-scalebound-is-a-different-kind-of-platinum-game|title = Scalebound is a different kind of Platinum Game|website = [[Eurogamer]]|date = 7 August 2015}}</ref> He said ''Hydlide 3'' was one of the first games he played on a PC and was inspirational because it had a hardcore game design that no one was doing on consoles at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/ask-platinumgames-anything-about-scalebound|title=Ask PlatinumGames Anything About Scalebound - IGN|date=27 August 2015}}</ref>
