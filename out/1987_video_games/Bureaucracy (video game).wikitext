'''''Bureaucracy''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] video game released by [[Infocom]] in 1987, scripted by comic science fiction author [[Douglas Adams]]. Infocom's twenty-fourth game, it is part of the Infocom Plus range which requires a machine with a minimum of 128K of memory.

==Plot==
The player must confront a long and complicated series of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] hurdles resulting from a recent change of address. Mail is being delivered to the wrong address, bank accounts are inaccessible, and nothing is as it should be. The game includes a measure of simulated [[blood pressure]] which rises when "frustrating" events happen and lowers after a period of no annoying events. Once a certain blood pressure level is reached, the player suffers an [[aneurysm]] and the game ends.

While undertaking the seemingly simple task of retrieving misdirected mail, the player encounters a number of bizarre characters, including an antisocial [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]], a paranoid weapons enthusiast, and a tribe of Zalagasan [[Human cannibalism|cannibal]]s. At the same time, they must deal with impersonal corporations, counterintuitive airport logic, and a hungry [[llama]].

==Gameplay==
Infocom rated ''Bureaucracy'' as "Advanced" in its difficulty rating system.

The game begins with a short online "software registration form" displayed on the screen. After the form has been completed, the game uses the given information after appropriately mangling it. (For example, the game will persistently address the player as the wrong gender, and whatever the player enters as "least favourite colour" will appear in numerous descriptions.)

The game has 50 locations.<ref>[http://www.if-legends.org/~pdd/infocom/fact-sheet.txt Infocom Fact Sheet], Section VI, Game Statistics</ref>

==Release==
The ''Bureaucracy'' packaging includes the following physical items:
#A pamphlet entitled ''You're ready to move!'' from the fictional bank Fillmore Fiduciary Trust
#A flier advertising the fictional magazine ''Popular Paranoia''
#A welcome letter from the player's new employer, Happitec Corporation
#A Fillmore "Better Beezer" credit card application form (each sheet of the triplicate [[carbon copy]] form had different instructions and questions)
#A very skinny pencil (similar to those provided at banks)
