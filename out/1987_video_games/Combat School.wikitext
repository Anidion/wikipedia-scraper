{{nihongo_foot|'''''Combat School''''',|コンバットスクール|Konbatto Sukūru|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} released as '''''Boot Camp''''' in North America, is a 1987 [[arcade video game]] produced by [[Konami]]. The player takes control of a military recruit who is undergoing [[basic training]] at a [[United States Marine Corps Recruit Training]] camp, also known as a boot camp. The arcade game uses [[trackball]] controls.

In 1987, [[Ocean Software]] released ports of the game for the [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[Amstrad CPC]] in Europe. Konami themselves later released the Commodore 64 version in North America under the ''Boot Camp'' title in 1989 alongside an [[MS-DOS]] version. An [[Amiga]] version was announced, but never released.

== Gameplay==
The control panel consists of a [[trackball]] and two buttons with different functions depending on the event. The game can be played against a CPU-controlled opponent or a second player. Player 1 takes control of Nick, a brown-haired recruit in an orange shirt, while Player 2 is Joe, a blond-haired recruit in a blue shirt.

The game is composed of seven training events whom the player must complete. Upon a near-success failure to complete an event (failing too severely results in game over), the player must do a set number of [[chin up]]s as punishment (this chance is given only once) in order to continue into the succeeding events, or it is [[game over]]. 

After all seven events are cleared, the player graduates from basic training only to be sent on a mission (the 8th and final stage) to rescue the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] from armed terrorists. The final stage consists of a single side-scrolling level where the player must fight off terrorists using all the skills acquired during the course of training. This stage can only be played by one player. Without a continue feature or spare stocks of lives, and because the player dies with one hit (minus the part that pits the player in a hand-to-hand combat against the terrorist leader) from anything, the final stage is extremely difficult to clear.

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Combat School'' on their July 1, 1987 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=311|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 July 1987|page=19|lang=ja}}</ref>

''[[Your Sinclair]]'' magazine gave the arcade game a positive review, comparing "Konami's new military arcade game" favorably with Konami's earlier [[Olympic video game]] ''[[Hyper Sports]]'' (1984).<ref name="YS21">{{cite magazine |title=Slots of Fun |magazine=[[Your Sinclair]] |date=August 1987 |issue=21 (September 1987) |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=80–1 |url=https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/your-sinclair/21#80}}</ref>
