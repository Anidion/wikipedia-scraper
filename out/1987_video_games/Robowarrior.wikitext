'''''RoboWarrior''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Bomber King'''''|ボンバーキング|Bonbā Kingu}}, is an action puzzle [[video game]] developed by [[Hudson Soft]], and co-developed by [[Aicom]], making it their first NES game they worked on, and published by [[Jaleco]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[MSX]].

==Plot==
''RoboWarrior'' takes place on an alien planet called Altile which was created by scientists as a solution to the overpopulation problem of [[Earth]].<ref name="moby">{{cite web |title=Robowarrior for NES |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/robowarrior |website=Moby Games |accessdate=6 September 2018}}</ref>
During a peaceful period on Altile, Robowarriors are decommissioned from Earth and the Xantho empire invades Altile and try to transform it for personal gain.<ref name="moby"/>

The player operates a cyborg named ZED (Z-type Earth Defence). In the game, ZED raids Altile to fight the Xantho empire and destroy its leader, Xur. ZED deploys bombs to clear a path through rocks, walls, and forests, while killing enemies and collecting items. Some [[gameplay]] elements resemble those of ''[[Bomberman (1983 video game)|Bomberman]]'' (1983).

The original Japanese plot of ''Bomber King'' is similar, but with some distinct differences. In the year 2036 on the planet Altile, the weather and climate suddenly drastically change due to some mysterious reason. The combat android Knight is sent to the planet to try and track down whatever force is causing the changes and defeat it.

==Gameplay==
''RoboWarrior'' comprises five [[Level (video gaming)|level]] formats and there are 27 levels in the game. In one, the player must obtain a key before the time limit expires. In another, the key is unavailable until the player acquires a crystal or chalice. Some levels are cast in darkness, rendering obstructions invisible unless the player has a lit lamp. Still other levels are [[Maze game|mazes]] in which a player must find and blast-through weak points in walls to proceed. Periodically, a player engages a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] level. Multiple bombs are required to bomb certain unconventional areas.<ref name="giantb">{{cite web |title=Robowarrior (Game) |url=https://www.giantbomb.com/robowarrior/3030-1352/ |website=Giant Bomb |accessdate=6 September 2018}}</ref> Robowarrior also features water stages.<ref name="giantb"/> Enemies respawn in each stage allowing the player to stock up on bombs.<ref name="giantb"/> ZED is controlled via an overhead viewpoint and the player can move him in four directions.<ref name="moby"/>

In 1991, [[Sunsoft]] published a sequel to ''Bomber King'' for [[Game Boy]], titled ''[[Blaster Master Jr.|Bomber King Scenario 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo's Famicom still gets releases 33 years later, like this all-star chiptunes album |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/27/nintendos-famicom-still-gets-releases-33-years-later-like-this-all-star-chiptunes-album/ |website=Venturebeat |accessdate=6 September 2018|date=2015-11-27 }}</ref>
