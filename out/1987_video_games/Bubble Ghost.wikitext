'''''Bubble Ghost''''' is an [[action video game]] created by Christophe Andréani for the [[Atari ST]] in 1987. The player controls a ghost who by blowing guides a floating bubble throughout a number of halls in a haunted house, while avoiding obstacles that can make the bubble pop.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Bubble ghost st hall04.gif|left|227x227px]]
The objective is to guide a bubble throughout a number of halls in a [[haunted house]]. If the bubble hits any walls or obstacles, then it will pop and the player loses a life. Obstacles include lit candles, electricity and fans. These can be all controlled by the ghost, who can wander around the level freely and blow at things - such as the bubble to add speed, the candle to put out the flame, or switches to turn them on or off.

The ghost is controlled using the mouse. A press on the left button of the mouse makes the ghost rotate to the left. A press on the right button of the mouse makes the ghost rotate to the right. A press on a keyboard key (Shift) makes the ghost blow.

The game is made of 35 halls (levels). Each time the player makes the bubble exit a hall, he wins 1000 points + left bonus. Action on animation may add 5000 points to the player. The bonus is re-initialized at every new hall. A new bubble is added to the player account each time the bubble exits towards the top of the hall.

==Ports==
The original ''Bubble Ghost'' was created by Christophe Andréani (design, programming) on an [[Atari ST]] computer. The game has been adapted for other computers throughout the world.

Some years later, [[ERE Informatique]] was bought by [[Infogrames]]. Infogrames published a new version of ''Bubble Ghost'' with updated graphics, ''Bubble +'' (''Bubble Plus'').

A [[Game Boy]] version was published in 1990. It was the first French game adapted for the Game Boy,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and one of the earliest games whose music was written by [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]].

==Development==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

The game was programmed in [[C (programming language)|C]] (editor and compiler: [[Megamax C]]) and 68000 [[assembly language]] on an [[Atari ST|Atari 1040 ST]] computer. The graphics were made with the [[DEGAS (software)|Degas Elite]] drawing software. The digital sound of the introductory page of the game ("Welcome to Bubble Ghost") was built using ST Replay. This is the author's voice. The other sound effects use the synthesizer inside the [[Atari ST]].

Here are some notes from the author when creating the game:
