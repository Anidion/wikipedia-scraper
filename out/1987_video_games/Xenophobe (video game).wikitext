'''''Xenophobe''''' is a video game developed by [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]] and released in arcades in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10503 |title=Xenophobe |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |access-date=4 October 2013}}</ref> [[Starbase]]s, moons, ships, and space cities are infested with [[Extraterrestrial life in culture|alien]]s, and the players have to kill the aliens before each is completely overrun. The screen is split into three horizontally-scrolling windows, one for each of up to three players, yet all players are in the same game world.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Great Forgotten Arcade Games We Want Revived|url=http://whatculture.com/gaming/10-great-forgotten-arcade-games-we-want-revived?page=8|website=WhatCulture|author=Lee|date=May 8, 2013}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
{{Game guide|date=October 2020|section}}

''Xenophobe'' is an action [[platformer]] game. The goal of each level is to defeat all the aliens before a countdown timer runs out. Some rooms routinely display the percentage of alien infection and time remaining until self-destruct when the level ends (but a nearby button can temporarily deactivate the count-down). Levels may contain more than one floor, and players use elevators to move between floors. Players can also pick up more powerful weapons to help in their eradication of the aliens.{{sfn|Atari|1989|pp=4—6}}

The hostile Xenos are encounted in a range of forms, beginning with Pods. If Pods hatch, they create a Critter which can attach itself to the player and drain health. If a Critter is not killed, it eventually matures into a Rollerbaby, which roll around to attack the player character. These in turn can grow into the Snotterpillar form, which attacks by leaping or spitting.{{sfn|Atari|1989|pp=7-8}}

In the Lynx version, an extra enemy called the Festor can appear in doorways, which can hypnotize and trap players, as well as throw eggs. If the egg lands on a screen with a player, it grows into another Pod.{{sfn|Atari|1990|pp=16—17}}

As players go through the various maps, they encounter various items to be picked up. Some only award bonus points at the end of the level, while others are immediately useful to the players, by restoring health. There are three ways a player can conclude a mission. If the player runs out of time, they are evacuated and the station is overrun. Alternatively, the player can kill a number of Xenos, then self-destruct the space station, gaining bonus points for each enemy defeated. Finally, the player can successfully defeat all the alien invaders, and recover the space station safely, to earn a larger point and health bonus.{{sfn|Atari|1989|pp=4}}

In some ports of the game, a player can play as a Snotterpillar and try to stop other players clearing the space station.{{sfn|Atari|1990|pp=12-13}}

==Characters==
There are nine characters to choose from in ''Xenophobe'', three for each joystick. The leftmost controller (red) features Mr. M.Brace, Dr. Kwack, and Col. Poupon. The middle controller (yellow) features Mr. Fogg, Col F. Truth, and Dr. Udderbay. The right controller (blue) features Mr. Eeez, Dr. Zordirz, and Col. Schickn. Humans and aliens alike make up the playable characters—for instance, Dr. Kwack has a duck's head. Players are also color-coded; for instance, the left player's choices wear red shirts, middle player's yellow, right player's blue.

===Atari Lynx===
In a capsule review of the Lynx version for ''[[STart (magazine)|STart]]'', [[Clayton Walnum]] commented, "The graphics in some rooms are more detailed than in others, and in general, aren't as impressive as those in ''[[ElectroCop]]'', a similar game. Also, the complicated controls take some getting used to."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Clayton |last=Walnum |author-link=Clayton Walnum|title=The Lynx Collection|magazine=[[STart (magazine)|STart]]|issue=39 |publisher=Antic Publishing |date=December 1990|page=73 |url=https://archive.org/stream/STart-Magazine-Issue-39}}</ref> Julian Rignall reviewed the game in the January 1991 issue of CVG Magazine.
