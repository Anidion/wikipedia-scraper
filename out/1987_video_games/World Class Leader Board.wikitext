==Reception==
Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "WCLB is a son that follows right in the footsteps of the father. The game play is smooth."<ref name="CGW38">{{cite magazine |last=Teverbaugh |first=Rick |title=Sports Scoreboard |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Juneâ€“July 1987 |volume=1 |issue=38 |pages=40}}</ref>

David M. Wilson and Johnny L. Wilson reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "WCLB does not show the player how much force is being applied on the power graph. Instead, the professional player is expected to have an intuitive grasp of the extent of his stroke. This is a very challenging facet of the game."<ref name="CGW46">{{cite magazine |last1=Wilson |first1=David M. |last2=Wilson |first2=Johnny L. |title=The Boys of Spring: A Computer Sports Survey |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1988 |volume=1 |issue=46 |pages=12}}</ref>
