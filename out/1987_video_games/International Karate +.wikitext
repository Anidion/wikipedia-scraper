'''''International Karate +''''', stylized as '''''IK+''''', is a [[fighting game]] written by [[Archer Maclean]] and published in 1987 by [[System 3 (company)|System 3]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. It is a successor to ''[[International Karate]]'' (1985). [[Activision]] published the Commodore 64 version in the US as '''''Chop N' Drop'''''.

==Gameplay==
[[file:C64 IKPlus.png|thumb|left|C64 screenshot]]
Three [[Karate|karateka]] fight against each other on a beach, trying to be the first to score six points. After every two rounds, there is a bonus game which is either deflecting [[bouncing ball]]s or kicking away bombs. The C64 version of the game only has the ball bouncing bonus game, and not the bomb bonus game. The game can be played by one or two [[player (game)|human player]]s; at least one fighter is always controlled by the computer. Unlike its predecessor, ''[[International Karate]]'', there is only one backdrop. However, different parts of the backdrop can be recoloured to several different themes by the players using specific keystrokes. The Amiga, Atari and C64 versions of the game (and possibly other versions, unconfirmed) had a number of "background antics", a Pac-Man would appear, a spider would descend, and a U-boat's periscope would occasionally be seen in the harbour. In addition, pressing a certain key or keys would cause the trousers of all three protagonists to fall down, after which they would do a double-take. Additionally, it was possible (on the Amiga version, at least) to type in four-letter curse words; the game would respond first by rebuking the player for their use of such language, and upon the second offence would reset the game.

==Development==
[[Archer Maclean]] did most of the work on developing the game, and the music was written by [[Rob Hubbard]]. Music for the Amiga version was arranged by [[David Lowe (video game composer)|Dave Lowe]]. In August 2005, the music from the game was performed at the third Symphonic Game Music Concert in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]].

The packaging illustration for the Activision Commodore 64 release version of ''IK+'', entitled "Chop 'N Drop", was created by Marc Ericksen.

==Ports==
16-bit versions of the game were released in 1988 for the [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] home computers. Apart from the music, which was arranged by [[David Lowe (video game composer)|Dave Lowe]], the Atari ST version was created entirely by Archer Maclean.<ref name="schwaiger89">Toni Schwaiger: "Archer Maclean.

The subsequent Amiga port took just seven days.<ref name="schwaiger89" />

==Legacy==
Another ''International Karate Deluxe'' game (AKA ''IK++'') was ready but unreleased for the Atari ST and Amiga in 1987/1988.<ref>In the chair with ... Archer Maclean. Retrogamer Magazine, issue 63 (2009).</ref>

It was also released by Activision in 1988 for the Commodore 64 under the title ''Chop 'N Drop''. A version for [[Amiga CD32]] was released in 1994.

In 2003, Maclean's [[Ignition Entertainment]] released ''IK+'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[PlayStation]] in Europe, which remained faithful to the 16-bit iterations.

The C64 version was re-released on the [[Virtual Console]] in Europe on July 25, 2008.
