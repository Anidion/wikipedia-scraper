'''''Knight Orc''''' is a [[text adventure]], with limited graphics on some platforms, by [[Level 9 Computing|Level 9]] released in 1987. It comes with a short novella by Peter McBride ("The Sign of the Orc") explaining the background to the story.

==Plot==
[[File:Knight_Orc_Atari_ST_screenshot.png|thumb|left|NPCs go about their lives while the player tries to solve the main quest (Atari ST screenshot)]]
After a night of heavy drinking with friends, Grindleguts the [[orc]] awakes to find himself strapped to a horse and about to [[jousting|joust]] with a human knight. His "friends" are nowhere to be seen, and he must somehow escape from his predicament and get even with them. Grindleguts must survive in a world of hostile humans while seeking revenge against his tormentors.

After the first chapter, the game switches to a science fiction setting, where Grindleguts is revealed to be a malfunctioning [[Mob (video games)|non-player character]] in a futuristic [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]. Using his power of transitioning between fantasy and reality, he convinces several other bots to join him, and escapes from the [[simulated reality]] facility.

== Gameplay ==
The game is a text adventure with limited graphics on some systems. Gameplay is similar to the later Level 9 adventure ''[[Gnome Ranger]]'', which uses the same game engine (KAOS).  The game flows in real time; each person and creature goes on about their daily lives and follows their schedule. The player must explore the settings while collecting useful items and interacting with various [[non-player character]]s to solve puzzles and problems.

''[[Sinclair User]]'' had this to say:<blockquote>"''Knight Orc'' is no ordinary adventure. Oh no, this is a multi-user adventure ... only the other players are simulated. One nice touch is the little bits that are added on to the end of descriptions which tell you what the other players are doing, such as 'Somewhere, a male voice cries out "Has anyone got any spare treasure?"' ... The location descriptions are exquisite and more than make up for the absence of graphics ... The humour worked into the text is like something out of a [[Douglas Adams]] novel, quick-fire and very enjoyable. Never droll... But the high spot of the game is the interactive characters... All have their own characters and their own goal to complete. And, the one thing they all have in common is that they all hate Orcs... Technically ''[[The Pawn]]'' may be superior, but in plot, enjoyment and atmosphere ''Knight Orc'' wins hands down."<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{Cite journal |title=Knight Orc Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=February 1988|issue=71|pages=80|url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-071/SinclairUser_071_Feb_1988#page/n79/mode/2up}}</ref></blockquote>

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that the graphics were a waste of disk space and the puzzles were "uneven". However, the excellent parser and other virtues resulted in an "above average" game.<ref name="roberts198804">{{cite magazine | title=Knight Orc | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=46 | date=April 1988 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=46 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | last=Roberts | first=Alan | pages=46–47}}</ref>

''[[Computer & Video Games]]'' gave the Knight Orc the C+VG HIT! award, praising the story and the unique protagonist perspective, additionally noting that the accompanying novella, The Sign of the Orc, is "a good read in its own right."<ref name="cvg198709">{{cite magazine | title=Knight Orc Review | magazine=[[Computer & Video Games]] | issue=71 | date=September 1987 | url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_071_1987-09_EMAP_Publishing_GB/page/n93/mode/2up | pages=94}}</ref>
