==Release==
The game was released in 1987 for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro on a wide variety of media. It was available on [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and 5.25" [[Disc Filing System|DFS]] [[floppy disk]] as well as [[Advanced Disc Filing System|ADFS]] 3.5" disk for the [[Acorn Electron#Acorn Plus 3|Acorn Electron Plus 3]] and [[BBC Master#Master Compact|Master Compact]]. It was included on the ''Play It Again Sam 5'' compilation in 1988 and also re-released in 1990 as part of the Superior/[[Blue Ribbon (software house)|Blue Ribbon]] budget range.

==Reception==
''Elixir'' was not as widely praised as other Superior releases. When reviewing the ''PIAS 5'' compilation, ''[[Electron User]]'' found the game lacking compared to the "superb" ''[[Imogen (video game)|Imogen]]'' (also on the compilation), saying "''Elixir'' is an arcade adventure that originates from the opposite end of the quality spectrum".<ref name="electron user">[http://8bs.com/elecgame/play_it_again_sam_05.htm "Continuing Compilations"], Carol Barlow, Electron User #6.5, February 1989</ref> ''[[Acorn User]]'' said that "the logical puzzles are well thought out... and give players something to get their teeth into".<ref>''Play It Again Sam 4'' inlay, Superior Software, 1988</ref>
