'''''Palace of Magic''''' is a [[platform game]] released on 1 November 1987 for the [[Acorn Electron]] and [[BBC Micro]] by [[Superior Software]]. Combining [[Platform game|platform]] elements with problem solving, it similar gameplay to the earlier ''[[Citadel (video game)|Citadel]]''. Both are early examples of the [[Metroidvania]] genre.<ref>{{cite news|last=Szczepaniak |first=John |title=Backtracking: The History of Metroidvania|work=[[GamesTM]]|issue=116|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|pages=148â€“53}}</ref><ref name="Dransfield">{{cite web | url = http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/previews/feature/a632015/the-swindle-preview-the-death-and-rebirth-of-size-fives-crime-caper/ | title = The Swindle preview: The death and rebirth of Size Five's crime caper | first = Ian | last = Dransfield | date = February 27, 2015 | accessdate = July 10, 2016 | publisher = [[Digital Spy]] | quote = "[T]his harks back to the times of BBC Micro games like ''Castle Quest'' or ''Palace of Magic'': really brutal, unfair ''Metroid-style'' things."}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[File:PalaceOfMagic.png|thumb|left|BBC Micro gameplay]]
The game begins with the [[player character]] in a [[palace]], having been shrunk and taken out of your normal place and time by an evil [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] called Caldeti (an [[anagram]] of Citadel). The objective is to magically restore the character to his original [[Resizing (fiction)|size]] and find the teleporter to their home world. This involves moving through the Palace and other locations such as a [[Church (building)|church]], [[wood]]s, and [[dungeon]], overcoming [[obstacle]]s and enemies along the way.

==Similarities to ''Citadel''==
The [[Player character|player]] is not automatically killed if they come into contact with hazards; instead the [[player (game)|player]] is allocated a set amount of [[energy]] (but this time measured by a [[bar (unit)|bar]], subdivided into units), which is depleted through contact, and can be replenished by collecting objects shaped like [[top hats]].  As in ''Citadel'', the game is divided into 'rooms' or screens and if the player loses too much energy in a room, the screen turns [[red]] and the player is transported back to where they entered the room. This prevents players from passing through a [[room]] simply by walking through enemies and taking the damage.

Other similarities to ''Citadel'' include:  
* Some areas of the game are not immediately accessible, but are blocked by coloured [[door]]s. In order to gain access the player needs to find a key with the same colour.
* Various objects are scattered throughout the game which must be collected to overcome [[obstacle]]s and [[hazard]]s.
* The location of a particular [[Electronic page|screen]] is provided by (x,y) co-ordinates, with (0,0) being the starting screen of the game.
* The player [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] is not superimposed over objects that it walks "in front" of; rather, the [[colour]] of the [[pixel]]s of the character sprite is overlaid, using an [[XOR]] bitwise operation, with the colour of the superimposed object, resulting in a completely different colour.

==Differences between BBC And Electron versions==
Whilst the layout of the Palace and the mechanics of the game are identical between the two machines, the BBC version runs in a higher resolution (seven-colour Mode 2) whilst the Electron version runs in four-colour Mode 5. The BBC version also includes a vertical hardware scroll when the player strikes the ground after a long fall, and flickering pixels above the collectible top hats.
