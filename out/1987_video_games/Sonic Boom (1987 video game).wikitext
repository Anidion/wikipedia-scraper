As with most scrolling shooters, the player pilots an airplane fighter, armed with a single gun, which can be powered up by collecting power ups dropped by certain colored enemies. The power ups can add a ship to the fighter's left and right sides and increase shot power and range. They can also drop bombs, which can wipe out all weak enemies on screen and do massive damage to stronger enemies.
