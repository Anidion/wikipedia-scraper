== Gameplay ==
[[File:Phoenix-1987-screenshot.png|Gameplay screenshot showing the hyperspace route tiles, including a red tile|thumb|left]]

The objective of ''Phoenix'' is to re-open 15 hyperspace routes which were closed by authorities, who also left gun turrets to guard the routes.<ref name=":1" /> In order to re-open the hyperspace routes, the player must pilot a spaceship known as the "Phoenix AY 21" to the end of each route. The hyperspace routes are represented by colored vector wireframe tiles. As the [[joystick]] is moved left or right, the tiles move under the ship, representing strafing movement of the craft, while the craft moves forward at a constant speed.<ref name=":0" />

This movement is used to navigate the different colored sections and to dodge gun turrets and black holes. Red tiles increase the ship's energy level, which is slowly depleted as the game goes on, and is also used to fire the ship's guns. Light blue tiles and shots from gun turrets drain the ship's energy level. Green tiles cause the player to lose control of the ship. Purple tiles instantly destroy the ship, as do black holes (represented by two rotating yellow triangles) and flying off tiles into empty space.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /> [[The Games Machine]] compared the gameplay to another game released in 1987: ''[[Cosmic Causeway: Trailblazer II]]'', which also features colored tiles that affect the player as they move across them. Whether the [[Trailblazer (video game)|''Trailblazer'']] series inspired ''Phoenix'' is unclear.<ref name=":0" />

The player can also press the R button to enter an [[instant replay]] mode which replays the last flight.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" />
