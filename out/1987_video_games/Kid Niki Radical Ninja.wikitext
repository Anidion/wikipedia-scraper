'''''Kid Niki: Radical Ninja''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Kaiketsu Yanchamaru'''''|快傑ヤンチャ丸||lit. "The Wonderful Yanchamaru"}}, is an [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Irem]] in 1986, and was later published outside Japan by [[Data East]] in 1987. The arcade game runs on Irem-62 Hardware, the same as ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung Fu Master]]''.

The differences between ''Kid Niki: Radical Ninja'' and ''Kaiketsu Yancha Maru'' are minimal. Aside from text translation, the most glaring difference is the main character's hair style. Kid Niki's hair is more "punk rock" with wild spikes and a ponytail in the back. Yancha Maru's hair has more subdued spikes and a topknot (or [[chonmage]]). In the arcade version of the game, the main character's [[keikogi]] is yellow while it is red in the home ports.

==Plot==
One day in [[Feudal Japan]], Kid Niki, the most radical of ninjas, is training at his [[Ninja]] School. Suddenly, a passing bird is struck down by an arrow and lands at Niki's feet. Attached is a note explaining that Niki's girlfriend, Princess Margo, has been kidnapped by the evil Stone Wizard. With the cry of "Will help you!" Niki bursts through the wall of his school and sets off on his quest to save Margo.

==Gameplay==
Kid Niki is armed with the Spinning Sword, which according to the game's manual, "has been passed down from generation to generation from the School of Chirin".

In addition to the spinning sword, Kid Niki can gain extra offensive power by collecting Bells. The Golden Bell allows him to launch a projectile every time Kid Niki spins his sword, and the Silver Bell creates a spinning force field around him. Both of these power-ups last for a limited amount of time.

The game is divided up into seven rounds, with a boss character at the end of each one.

==Ports==

In 1987, [[Data East]] released ports of the game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Apple II]]. All home versions of the game show screen shots from the graphically superior arcade version on the back of their packages. Although it is an Irem game, the home ports were one of the more successful games released by [[Data East]].

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called ''Kid Niki'' "yet another in the seemingly endless parade of horizontally-scrolling/running/jumping/shooting games" for the NES. While the reviewer stated that those who enjoyed such games would like the game, he wondered "how many of these interchangeable games Nintendo will authorize. Even devotees must be getting tired".<ref name="cgw198809">{{cite magazine | title=Video Gaming World | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=51 | date=September 1988 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=51 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | last1=Worley | first1=Joyce | last2=Katz | first2=Arnie | last3=Kunkel | first3=Bill | pages=52}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In Japan, two sequels appeared for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]]. The first was ''Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2: Karakuri Land'' in 1991, and the second was ''Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3'' in 1993. Each of the three NES/Famicom titles feature radically different character designs.

There is a [[Game Boy]] sequel called ''Ganso!! Yanchamaru'' in 1991. This portable sequel is a unique game and not a port of one of the existing ''Kid Niki/Yanchamaru'' titles.

Kid Niki makes a cameo appearance in Irem's [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[Kickle Cubicle]]''. To see Kid Niki, the player must hold down the A button on Controller 2, and then turn on the game. Then the player continues holding A until the title screen appears, and Kid Niki will appear. This trick also works on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] version of ''[[Kickle Cubicle]]''.

''Kid Niki Radical Ninja'' was [http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/arcadearchives/switch/knr_ninja.htm published] for the Nintendo Switch by HAMSTER as part of their [http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/arcadearchives/switch/index.htm Arcade Archives] series in January 2018.
