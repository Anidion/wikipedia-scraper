'''''The King of Chicago''''' is a 1986 [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game by Doug Sharp. Based on numerous [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[gangster|mobster]] [[film|movies]], this game is set in the 1930s, but some sequences towards the end of the game take place in 1986. The Macintosh version of the game is animated using [[Clay animation|claymation]],<ref name=macworld /> while other versions utilize drawn graphics.

==Description==

The player starts in [[Chicago]] with a small [[mafia]]-type mob and follow [[Al Capone]] in being the mob-king of the city.  The goal of the game is to increase the size of one's gang in order to take over all mobster activity in the city.  The player must do this by a certain date in order to be included in the formation of the [[New York City|New York]] [[syndicate]].

The game features many [[mobster]] activities, such as [[drive-by shooting]]s, bombings, illegal [[gambling]] and [[bribery|bribing]] of corrupt [[politician|government officials]].  The player must murder and out-deal his opponents in order to win control of the city.  As if that weren't enough, the player also has to stay one step ahead of the law and keep his girlfriend satisfied by catering to her whims and desires, or risk losing her.

The game has many endings determined by the choices the player makes. Wrong choices could end in the player's death or arrest. But there are several ways to win the game; one such way is to kill the leader of the main rival gang.

==Ports==
This game was first developed by Doug Sharp on the [[Macintosh]], then limited to a monochrome display, using graphics based on digitized images of clay models. The game was given a complete visual redesign by the inhouse Cinemaware art team for release on the [[Amiga]], then [[porting|ported]] to the [[Apple IIgs|Apple II<small>GS</small>]], [[Atari ST]], [[DOS]], and [[X68000]]. The Mac version was published by [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]] and later versions for US platforms published by Cinemaware itself. Distribution in the UK, including platforms found almost exclusively there and in Europe, was done by Mirrorsoft.

In July, 2012, Cinemaware announced they were planning to release an [[iOS]] emulated version of the Amiga edition of ''The King of Chicago''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemaware.com/heroes-live-foreveras-cinemaware-returns-with-new-online-presence-and-the-king-of-chicago-on-ios/

==Reception==
''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''The King of Chicago'', praising its attempt to bridge the gap between movies and video games, stating that "''The King of Chicago'' delivers a game that comes one step closer to the computer entertainment dream: a real-time movie controlled by the user." ''Macworld''  praises ''The King of Chicago's'' gameplay and graphics, calling the [[claymation]] graphics "innovative" and gameplay "consistently entertaining", furthermore stating that "Everything is handled with self-parodying wit and interchanges between characters are terrifically funny. I've never had so much fun playing a computer game." ''Macworld'' heavily criticized the lack of a save feature, calling it "appalling that a game that takes hours to complete won't let you save", and although characters behave differently in different playthroughs, ''Macworld'' expressed that the game suffers from "eventual repetitiveness", saying that "eventually you find yourself watching some scenes again and again."<ref name=macworld>{{cite magazine|last = Levy|first = Steven|title = In Gangland Chicago: The King of Chicago 1.0 Review|date = July 1987|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_8707_July_1987/page/n157|magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|page = 152}}</ref>
