'''''Sky Fox''''' is a 1987 [[arcade video game]] developed by [[Jaleco]] and licensed to [[Nihon Bussan|Nichibutsu]]. It was originally released in Japan and Europe as '''''Exerizer''''' (エクセライザー) as an indirect follow-up to Jaleco's 1983's ''[[Exerion]]'' and 1984's ''Exerion II: Zorni''. It is a [[fixed shooter]], setting the player in the role of a space pilot fighting against female alien invaders and space monsters under their control. The game was mostly well-received by Western game critics, albeit some criticized it for its depiction of women.

== Gameplay==
The game is a [[fixed shooter]] in the style of ''[[Galaga]]''<ref name=zzap/> and ''[[Phoenix (1980 video game)|Phoenix]]'',<ref name=cu/> but with eight-way movement across the screen and [[parallax scrolling]] for the starry backgrounds. At the player's disposal to fight the approaching enemies, some of them made in pseudo-depth [[2.5D]] graphics with scaled [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s, is a small space fighter capable of firing two types of projectiles: the unlimited but slow rockets and the fast laser shots that are limited by draining the ship's power. The power can be refilled, and the ship itself upgraded, through collecting the [[power-up]]s that appear after destroying certain enemies.<ref name=zzap/><ref name=cvg/><ref name=rg/>

The game can be played by up to two players in alternating turns. Similar as in ''[[Gorf]]'', it features several different types of waves (stages). For instance, one stage features space witches saddle-perched on either serpentine [[Chinese dragon]]s or Western-style winged dragons: the dragons must to be hit repeatedly in the weak point of their heads to be killed, after which the riders themselves can be shot for a [[Score (game)|score]] bonus. The player progresses through most of them by either destroying all the enemies (resulting in the score bonus and power-up awards) or alternatively just surviving their attacks for a long enough time.<ref name=zzap>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap-italia-14/14#page/n37/ |title=Zzap! 14 |date=July 1987 |publisher=Edizioni Hobby S.r.l. |accessdate=2015-09-04}}</ref><ref name=cvg/><ref name=rg/>

==Reception==
The game has been received mostly positively upon its release. In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Sky Fox'' on their April 1, 1987 issue as being the twelfth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=305|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 April 1987|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref> The Italian edition of ''[[Zzap!64|Zzap!]]'' called it a treat "for those who love the space shooter genre, ensuring a good fun for a sufficient period of time."<ref name=zzap/> A review by Clare Edgeley of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called it "a weird mish-mash of ideas from best-sellers of the past - the dragons have been borrowed from ''[[Space Harrier]]'', and there are many scenes reminiscent of that golden oldie, ''[[Space Invaders]]''." She complemented its colorful graphics and verdicted that "the game does offer a fast and relatively addictive shoot 'em up."<ref name=cvg>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-and-videogames-068/ComputerAndVideoGames_068_Jun_1987#page/n121 |title=Computer and Videogames Magazine Issue 068 |date=June 1987 |accessdate=2015-09-04}}</ref>

''[[Commodore User]]'', however, refused to even score this "slickly-executed" but "otherwise boring game", accusing its "warped {{sic|idot}}" creators of promoting sexual assault due to in their opinion "tasteless", "highly objectionable" and "offensive" stage featuring a group of female enemies who are only vulnerable when they open up their cloaks "and expose their sparsely-clad bodies in the [[Spreadeagle (position)|spreadeagle position]]. The method of dispatching them is to score a direct hit between their splayed legs." The reviewer described it as an act to "humiliate and belittle women in the most violent, degrading way, by subjecting them to [[sexual violence]]," and implied this "cheap 'n' nasty" game's "presence in arcades" to be "dangerous" for British society.<ref name=cu>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/commodore-user-magazine-44/Commodore_User_Issue_44_1987_May#page/n89/mode/2up |title=Commodore User Magazine Issue 44 |date=May 1987 |accessdate=2015-09-04}}</ref> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' arcade section remembered it as a "sexist shoot'em up".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-070/SinclairUser_070_Jan_1988#page/n85/mode/2up |title=Sinclair User Magazine Issue 070 |date=January 1988 |accessdate=2015-09-04}}</ref>

According to a retrospective review in ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', when compared to much of Jaleco's other arcade titles, ''Sky Fox'' "can be seen as a bit of diamond in the rough, as it's a nicely presented little-known vertical shooter that plays like a mixture of ''[[Galaxian]]'' and ''Space Harrier''." The reviewer felt the game's need of "banking and consideration to attacking enemies is a neat mechanic, which, coupled with ''Sky Fox''{{'}}s nice visuals and humorous enemy designs (bikini-clad dragon riders in space manage to be more off-the-wall than ''Space Harrier'''s enemies), makes it an enjoyable little shooter," and recommended [[Cave (company)|Cave]]'s ''[[Espgaluda II]]'' as a "[[Video game conversion|converted]] alternative".<ref name=rg>''Retro Gamer'', issue 79, page 65.</ref>
