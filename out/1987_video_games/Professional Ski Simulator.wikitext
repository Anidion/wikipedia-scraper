'''''Professional Ski Simulator''''' is an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sports simulation]] game released by [[Codemasters]] in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Amstrad CPC]]. It was later released for the [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] as '''''Advanced Ski Simulator'''''.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay consists of simulated downhill skiing of increasing difficulty. Players can race against each other, or against the computer. The slope must be completed passing through all of the checkpoints and within a time limit. The game is viewed in overhead isometric 3D perspective.

The game screen always tracks the leading contestant, so if a player falls too far behind he will lose sight of his skier. However, an icon map in the corner of the screen shows the locations of both players and the checkpoints, enabling a skilled player to still complete the race.

{{blockquote|The slopes are the best part of the game. A delight to see, they are beautifully designed using clever shading to give the impression of different gradients. Another great game by the Ollie bros... Well done lads, more please, more.<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{Citation|title=Professional Ski Simulator Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=December 1987}}</ref>}}
