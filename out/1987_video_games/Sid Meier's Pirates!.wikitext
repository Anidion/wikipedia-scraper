'''''Sid Meier's Pirates!''''' is a [[video game]] created by [[Sid Meier]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and published by [[MicroProse]] in May 1987. It was the first game to include the name "Sid Meier" in its title as an effort by MicroProse to attract fans of Meier's earlier games, most of which were combat vehicle [[simulation video game]]s. The game is a simulation of the life of a [[Piracy|pirate]], a [[privateer]], or a pirate hunter in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. It was widely ported to other systems.

''Pirates!'' is set in the [[Caribbean]]. The ''Pirates!'' playing field includes the [[Spanish Main]] (namely the northern coast of [[South America]]), [[Central America]] and the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], the entire [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Florida]], and all Caribbean islands, plus [[Bermuda]] in the PC version. The player is free to sail to any part of the above-mentioned lands, stopped by an invisible barrier southeast of [[Trinidad]], all the way north to just northeast of Bermuda.

The ''[[Pirates! Gold]]'' remake, with minor improvements and better graphics, was released in 1993. An [[enhanced remake]], also named ''[[Sid Meier's Pirates! (2004 video game)|Sid Meier's Pirates!]]'', was released in 2004. Versions for [[Mobile game|mobile devices]] have also been released.

==Gameplay==
''Pirates!'' is a single-player, [[open-world]] game. The player receives a [[letter of marque]] authorizing service as a privateer for the [[Spanish Empire]], the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Kingdom of England]], or the [[French colonial empire]] in the [[Caribbean]]. The player's loyalties may change over the course of the game; they may also hold [[Military rank|rank]] with multiple countries and may turn to piracy at any time. Gameplay is open-ended; the player may choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members, or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase their wealth through [[trade]]. The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. As the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point they are given a position in their future life, from beggar to King's advisor, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.

The era of play is one of the choices given to a player at game-start. Different eras provide a different challenge, as political and economic power shifts between the four fledgling European empires. Choosing 1560 (the earliest choice) as the starting year places the player in the Caribbean almost devoid of influence but that of Spain, while 1680 (the latest choice) provides a mature Caribbean with many non-Spanish colonies and an overall higher degree of activity in the region. The other choices include 1600, 1620, 1640, and 1660, with the progressive effect of reducing Spanish dominance in favor of the other nations, while increasing seafaring traffic. Ship designs are also era-dependent, with some types of ships appearing more frequently in certain eras and less in others, and certain ship types being used near-exclusively by certain nations.

[[Image:Pirates-screenshot-small.png|thumb|left|In this [[Macintosh]] version, graphics like terrain were painted with special glyphs in a custom [[typeface|font]].]]

The game tests a wide range of skills: [[Eye–hand coordination|hand-eye coordination]] during the [[fencing]] sections, tactical ability during the land and sea combat phases, and strategic thinking, for everything from choosing a wife to deciding when to divide up the plunder. Moreover, each game is likely to take a different course, as most events in the game are random, including the economic and political systems, and early in the game, these can greatly affect future strategic options. In the course of the game a player may try to [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] in a [[Frigate#Age of sail|frigate]] in order to run down a smaller and faster [[Full-rigged pinnace|pinnace]], but must be fortunate enough to have the [[weather gage]].

One of the most innovative features of ''Pirates!'' is the introduction of a dynamic playing field. In ''Pirates!'' many of the most important factors which affect player decisions are randomized at the beginning of the game and continue to shift during gameplay. This not only creates a new experience each time the game is played, but also requires the player to remain flexible, and be ready to exploit possibilities when they occur. Changes happen whenever time passes and they are unrelated to player actions. In fact, in this game in the series, random events do not have any graphical representation, and the player can do nothing to prevent them.

The most important random factor in the game lies in the diplomatic relations between the four nations laying claim to the Caribbean. Relations may differ greatly from game to game, and can shift in an instant, creating and removing opportunities, possibly even for long periods of time. The player generally benefits from periods of war between two or more countries, because any aggression towards a country's ships or cities, which occurs often if not specifically avoided, will gain recognition with its enemies, prompting them to bestow the player with land, titles, and other benefits. During peacetime, the player can only benefit from the capture of pirates on the high seas, which is seen as favorable by all nations, but is a rare occurrence.

Cities are also dynamic, with statistics like wealth and population fluctuating constantly. The player can access any city's statistics. Knowing the statistics of a city helps the player plan ahead, especially with regards to trading or any desire to raid or conquer cities.

The original versions of ''Pirates!'' sported both disk and manual copy protections. Users were asked the time at which various treasure ships were arriving at the port. If the time was wrong, the game would continue, but at a much higher difficulty level that would frustrate most people.

==Development==
In early 1986, Meier and fellow MicroProse designer [[Arnold Hendrick]] wanted to create a role-playing adventure game, but Meier's business partner [[Bill Stealey]] was skeptical of producing non-vehicle simulations.<ref name="schick199001">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=67 | title=Designer's Notes / The Secret History of Sword of the Samurai | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=January 1990 | access-date=15 November 2013 | author=Schick, Lawrence | pages=84}}</ref> ''Pirates!'' is mostly written in [[Commodore BASIC]]. Comments in the source code indicate that Meier originally intended to call it ''Pirates of the Spanish Main!!''.<ref name="harbron20210628">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJOjSQ0yv8U |title=Exploring Sid Meier's Pirates! - BASIC Code, Quirks, Bugs on Commodore 64 |date=2021-06-28 |last=Harbron |first=Robin |type=YouTube |publisher=8-Bit Show And Tell |time=25:11}}</ref> The company planned several game elements that it removed before release, including multiple NPCs per town, more detailed sailing including [[fleet action]]s, and a subplot involving religion and nobility.{{r|brooks198711}}

With five successful years behind him, Microprose considered star designer Sid Meier a selling point and chose to put his name on the box of his next game, despite a shift away from combat simulators he had become known for.<ref name=retro132>{{cite journal|title=Classic Moments - Pirates!|journal=Retro Gamer|issue=132|date=2014|pages=30–31}}</ref> According to Stealey, the idea to add Meier's name came after meeting [[Robin Williams]]: "We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. And he turns to me and says 'Bill, you should put Sid's name on a couple of these boxes, and promote him as the star'".<ref>[https://kotaku.com/the-father-of-civilization-584568276 "Sid Meier: The Father of Civilization". Kotaku.]</ref>

Meier in his interview said that "''Pirates!'' was actually inspired by a technological trick" when "one of our programmers came up with a cool trick where we could create images, pieces of art, by packing them into a font. And that allowed us to very quickly bring in new pictures".<ref name=retro112>{{cite journal|title=Tell Us Something We Don't Know|journal=Retro Gamer|issue=112|date=2013|pages=65}}</ref>

Meier admits that ''Pirates!'' was not intended to provide an authentic, true-to-life recreation of historical piracy: "''Pirates!'' was designed more around your fantasy of pirates than the actual reality. That allowed you to bring in all the stuff from the movies, whatever you had read, whatever was in your imagination".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/27/civilization-sid-meier-interview-starships Dredge, Stuart (February 2015). Sid Meier interview: "Learning is part of any good video game". ''The Guardian''.]</ref>

==Ports==
The game was widely [[porting|ported]] from the original [[Commodore 64]] version,<ref name=retro38>{{cite journal|title=The Making of Pirates!|journal=Retro Gamer|issue=38|date=2007|pages=58–61}}</ref> first to the [[Apple II]] (1987), then later to [[IBM PC compatible]]s (1987), [[Apple IIGS]] (1988), [[Macintosh]] (1988), [[Amstrad CPC]] (1988), [[Atari ST]] (1989), [[Amiga]] (1990), and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (1991). The NES port was developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Ultra Games]]. Tobacco is replaced as a trade item by "crops" because of Nintendo's family-friendly requirements.

The IBM PC version was originally released in 1987 as a [[self-booting disk]], stored on either two 5¼-inch disks or a single 3½-inch disk. A version for MS-DOS compatible operating systems was released in 1994 on CD-ROM in Europe, edited by [[Kixx (U.S. Gold)|Kixx]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-pirates/release-info|title = Sid Meier's Pirates!

''Pirates!'' was a groundbreaking game in its era. Its puzzles appealed more to female gamers than previous products from MicroProse, a company known for military simulations like ''[[F-15 Strike Eagle (video game)|F-15 Strike Eagle]]''.<ref name="brooks198711">{{cite news | title=Titans of the Computer Gaming World / MicroProse | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1987 | author=Brooks, M. Evan | pages=16}}</ref> Although other open-ended games had already been released, the style of player-directed gameplay in ''Pirates!'' led it to be the spiritual predecessor of countless others since, both by Sid Meier himself (''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'', ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]'') and many others.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' in 1987 praised the detailed gameplay with arcade and strategic aspects, stating that "the designers of ''Pirates!'' set themselves a variety of ambitious goals and succeeded on every count". The magazine concluded that the game "is a real treasure".<ref name="ferrell198710">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-10-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_52_1987_Oct#page/n59/mode/2up | title=Pirates! | work=Compute's Gazette | date=October 1987 | access-date=3 March 2015 | author=Ferrell, Keith | pages=59–60}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' said that although reminiscent of ''[[The Seven Cities of Gold (video game)|The Seven Cities of Gold]]'' or ''[[Broadsides (video game)|Broadsides]]'', "Pirates will prove to be a design with fresh approaches and much historical depth ... intriguing and addicting".<ref name="cgw198711">{{cite magazine | title=Christmas Buyers Guide | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=November 1987 | pages=20 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_41/page/n19/mode/2up |issue=41}}</ref> The game was reviewed in 1988 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column.
