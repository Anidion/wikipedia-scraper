{{nihongo foot|'''''Darius'''''|ダライアス|Daraiasu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1987 [[shoot 'em up|horizontal-scrolling shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Taito]]. Players control a starship named the Silver Hawk in its mission to destroy the Belser empire before they wipe out the planet Darius. Its gameplay involves traversing through a series of scrolling levels while destroying enemies and collecting power-up icons. It is notable for its unique three-screen panoramic display,<ref name="hardcore">{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/darius/darius.htm|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|title=Darius|author=Kurt Kalata|access-date=2011-01-10|archive-date=2012-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226164321/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/darius/darius.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> upbeat soundtrack, and cute [[anime]]-influenced graphics.

The game was designed by a small team of others led by Junji Yarita. In contrast to other similar games, which feature mechanical or insect-like enemies, ''Darius'' uses aquatic creatures like fish and crabs for its enemies and screen-filling bosses. Its large arcade cabinet, based on Taito's earlier panoramic display game ''Laser Grand Prix'' (1983), was designed to provide a cinematic atmosphere and stand out from other games at the time. The upbeat soundtrack was created by Taito's "house band" [[Zuntata]], the majority being composed through a combination of FM synthesis and sampling.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC Darius.png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]

''Darius'' is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen is three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet uses an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as ''zones'' in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by [[power-up]]s (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.<ref name="vgexplosion">{{Cite book | last = Wolf | first = Mark | title = The Video Game Explosion: A History from PONG to PlayStation and Beyond | publisher = [[Greenwood Press]] | year = 2007 | location = Westport, CT | page = 97 | isbn = 978-0-313-33868-7}}</ref><ref>{{KLOV game|7514|Darius}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Maughan|first=Teresa|title=Slots of Fun|journal=Your Sinclair|date=September 1987|issue=21|page=81|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-21/YourSinclair_21_Sep_1987#page/n79/mode/2up |access-date=23 April 2016|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Edgeley|first=Clare|title=Arcade Action|journal=Computer and Video Games|date=March 1987|issue=65|page=92|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_065_1987-03_EMAP_Publishing_GB/Computer__Video_Games_Issue_065_1987-03_EMAP_Publishing_GB#page/n91/mode/2up |access-date=23 April 2016}}</ref>

==Plot==
After years of pollution and the depletion of natural resources on Earth, humans decided to search beyond the [[Solar System]] for habitable planets to live on. A space program dedicated to this premise eventually found a solar system similar to the Earthling's and the space colonists selected a habitable planet they named Darius.

After settling on Darius, the inhabitants learned to start a new life and thrive in both society and technology. However, their peace was disturbed by an armada of malevolent maritime shaped space craft controlled by the Belser Army, a race of humanoid space colony based warrior people who have selected the Darius colonists as their next combatants. The Darius inhabitants' only line of defense were the Silver Hawk series: single-piloted fighter craft designed for long space travel with the ability to wield different weapons at the same time. Two of the fleet's top pilots were selected to defend Darius: Proco and Tiat. Together, the two assigned in thwarting Belser's attack on Darius.<ref name="ATVGL:JaO1971-2005">{{cite book|last=Akagi|first=Masumi|url=https://archive.org/stream/ArcadeGameList1971-2005#page/n44/mode/1up|title=タイトー (Taito); Taito America; D|work=アーケードTVゲームリスト 国内•海外編 (1971-2005)|edition=1st|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement News Agency]]|date=13 October 2006|pages=43, 137, 150|isbn=978-4990251215|language=ja}}</ref>

==Development==
''Darius'' was designed by Junji Yarita, with assistance by planner Akira Fujita and programmer Toru Sugawara.<ref name="G10">{{cite magazine|last=Ishii|first=Zenji|url=https://archive.org/stream/gamest0010#page/n26/mode/2up|title=ダライアス開発者座談会|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=July 1987|pages=22–23|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/dariusii/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730072543/http://shmuplations.com/dariusii/|date=2019-07-30}}).</ref> Fujita was interested in creating a shoot'em up game where the player fought a huge battleship at the end of each stage — as a way to "spice things up" and make it stand out among other similar games, Fujita made the bosses themed around fish and other aquatic creatures.<ref name="G10"/> Yarita designed these battleships and created a total of 26 different designs, but time constraints only allowed the development team to use 11 of them in the final game.<ref name="G10"/> A single boss took roughly ten days to create.<ref name="G10"/> Some of the unused designs made it onto the game's promotional material, which was attributed to the art being outsourced to a different company.<ref name="G10"/>

[[File:Dariuscab.jpg|thumb|left|''Darius'' cabinets use mirrors on the sides of the center monitor to reflect monitors below.]]

The arcade cabinet, designed by Natsuki Hirosawa, uses three individual monitors made to appear seamless via mirror effects.<ref name="Beep29">{{cite magazine|title=ダリウスのメイキング|magazine=[[:ja:ゲーマガ|Beep]]|issue=29|publisher=[[SB Creative|SoftBank Creative]]|date=April 1987|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/darius/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914183330/http://shmuplations.com/darius/|date=2019-09-14}}).</ref> The idea was previously used in Taito's earlier games ''Wyvern F-O'' and ''Super Dead Heat'', and was added to give the game a more cinematic presentation and to make it feel more unique compared to other shooting games on the market.<ref name="Beep29"/> A headphone jack and volume dials are also present, as is a speaker system installed beneath the player's seat, which is referred to by Taito as a "body sonic" system. This concept was originally meant to be used for the 1983 game ''Laser Grand Prix'', but it proved too costly and was scrapped.<ref name="G10"/> The enemy names were derived from different types of medicine, alongside names of people within the company spelled backwards.<ref name="G10"/> Fujita worked on the stage designs and power-ups himself, which he stated was one of the biggest challenges during development — ship upgrades were originally in the form of small pod-like craft that orbited the player; Fujita disliked this idea and cut it from the game.<ref name="G10"/> The game also features cute anime-influenced graphics.

The game's upbeat soundtrack was composed by [[Hisayoshi Ogura]], the founder of Taito's "house band" [[Zuntata]].<ref name="SEMO">{{cite web|last1=Kotowski|first1=Don|last2=Greening|first2=Chris|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/hisayoshiogura.shtml|title=Interview with Hisayoshi Ogura|website=squareenixmusic.com|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|date=April 2011|access-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713042546/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/hisayoshiogura.shtml |archive-date=2018-07-13|url-status=live}}</ref> Ogura wanted the music to convey a sense of a deep, expanded universe, and to make it stand out among other shoot'em up games at the time.<ref name="SEMO"/> Much of the music was composed via a combination of FM synthesis and sampling, while some was made by the Yokosuka Symphony orchestra group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shmuplations.com/darius/|title=Darius – 1987 Composer Interview with Hisayoshi "OGR" Ogura|website=shmuplations.com|access-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914183330/http://shmuplations.com/darius/|archive-date=2019-09-14|url-status=live}}</ref> The song "Captain Neo", used in the game's first zone, was originally used as the main theme for Taito's earlier arcade game ''Metal Soldier Isaac II'', used as a placeholder track during its presentation at tradeshows — Ogura liked the track for its sense of "overwhelming power", and decided to keep it in the final version.<ref name="SEMO"/>

==Release==
The arcade game made its debut at London's [[Amusement Trades Exhibition International]] (ATEI) show in January 1987.<ref name="CVG65"/> In the same year, ''Darius'' was released for arcades in Japan in February, and in North America in April.<ref name="ATVGL:JaO1971-2005"/>

Three PC Engine ports were produced by [[NEC Avenue]] for the Japanese market in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]]. ''Super Darius'' was released for the CD-ROM² System add-on on March 16, followed by ''Darius Plus'' as an 8-Megabit HuCard version on September 21. ''Darius Plus'' is the only commercially released HuCard that has enhanced support for the [[PC Engine SuperGrafx]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=スーパーPCエンジンファン|trans-title=Super PC Engine Fan|language=ja|volume=1|publisher=Tokuma Shoten Intermedia|date=January 15, 1994}}</ref> A third version, ''Darius Alpha'', was released as a sweepstakes giveaway and was limited to only 800 copies. ''Darius Alpha'' is an alternate version of ''Darius Plus'' where the player fights only the bosses. Like ''Darius Plus'', it has enhanced support for the SuperGrafx.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/gamesmasa/62328044.html|title=ダライアスプラス (ゲーム) - ゲーム広告資料館 - Yahoo!ブログ|language=ja|access-date=2019-05-03|archive-date=2019-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503213323/https://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/gamesmasa/62328044.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> All three PC Engine versions were developed by Bits Laboratory. During the same year, a home computer version of the game titled ''Darius+'' (unrelated to the similarly titled PC Engine port) was developed and published by [[Edge Games|The Edge]] for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] in [[Europe]]. In 2002, [[PCCW]] ported the game to the [[Game Boy Advance]]'' in Japan as ''Darius R''.

In August 2016 the original arcade version was re-released for [[PlayStation 4]] in Japan and other Asian [[PlayStation Store|PS-Store]]s. The port was made by [[Hamster Corporation]] and is part of the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' on PlayStation 4.<ref>{{cite web |last=Romano |first=Sal |title=Darius Series, Other Taito Classics Coming to PS4 Arcade Archives |url=http://gematsu.com/2015/08/darius-other-taito-classics-coming-ps4-arcade-archives |website=Gematsu |access-date=29 July 2019 |date=August 19, 2015}}</ref> ''Darius R'', a remake of the first ''Darius'' game with some different tunes and a fewer number of stages, was released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2002.
