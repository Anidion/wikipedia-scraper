==Reception==
''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]'' gave it an overall review score of 695/1000, calling it certainly one of the better [[Graphic Adventure Creator|GAC]] games released by [[Incentive Software|Incentive]]."<ref>''ACE'' 11/1987, page 89.</ref> Mike Gerrard of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' wrote that "apart from a few careless screen layouts this is one of the best GAC games I've yet seen. The speech function is often limited to saying 'Hello' just to get a response from the characters, but I liked the way the authors seem to have successfully packed lots of features into the program. Highly recommended."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/karyssiaqueenofdiamonds.htm |title=Karyssia, Queen Of Diamonds |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref>

According to ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'', apart from spell casting gameplay element, "the game is an average fantasy romp, OK, but not outstanding."<ref>''Popular Computing Weekly'' 10/1987, page 143.</ref> On the other hand, a reviewer for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' gave it an overall score of 87/100: "''Karyssia'' is a fine adventure with many admirable features. The pretty 3-D graphics are thin on the ground, and the location descriptions aren't the most evocative I've read, but the plot, which unwinds along three separately loading parts, holds the attention marvelously."<ref>''Crash'', 11/1987, page 106.</ref>
