'''''Mega Man''''', known as {{nihongo foot|'''''Rockman'''''|ロックマン|Rokkuman|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan, is a [[platform game]] developed and published by [[Capcom]] in 1987 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was directed by Akira Kitamura, with Nobuyuki Matsushima as lead programmer, and is the first game of the [[Mega Man|''Mega Man'' franchise]] and [[Mega Man|the original video game series]]. ''Mega Man'' was produced by a small team specifically for the [[video game console|home console]] market, a first for Capcom, which previously focused on [[arcade video game]]s.

The game follows the struggle of the [[humanoid robot]] and [[player-character]] [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]] against the [[mad scientist]] [[Dr. Wily]] and the six "Robot Masters" under his control. ''Mega Man''{{'}}s [[nonlinear gameplay]] lets the player choose the order in which to complete its initial six [[Level (video gaming)|stages]]. Each culminates in a [[boss battle]] against one of the Robot Masters that awards the player-character a unique weapon. Part of the strategy of the game is that the player must carefully choose the order in which to tackle the stages so that they can earn the weapons that will be most useful for future stages.

Critics praised ''Mega Man'' for its overall design. ''Mega Man'' established many of the gameplay, story, and graphical conventions that would define the ensuing sequels, subseries, and spin-offs in the ''Mega Man'' franchise. The game has since been re-released in game compilations such as ''[[Mega Man Legacy Collection]]'', ported to [[mobile phone]]s, and become a part of console [[Emulator|emulation]] services. A remake with 3D graphics, titled ''[[Mega Man Powered Up]]'', was released for the [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2006.

==Plot==
In the year 20XX, robots developed to assist mankind are commonplace thanks to the efforts of renowned robot designer [[List of Mega Man characters#Dr. Light|Dr. Light]]. However, one day, these robots go out of control and start attacking humans, among them six advanced humanoid robots created by Dr. Light for industrial purposes. Known as the "Robot Masters", they consist of Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man. Dr. Light realizes that the culprit responsible for these attacks is his old rival [[Doctor Wily|Dr. Wily]], but is unsure of what to do. His helper robot, Rock, having a strong sense of justice, offers to be converted into a fighting robot to stop Dr. Wily's plans, dubbing himself [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]].<ref>''Rockman'' manual, December 17, 1987, [[Capcom|Capcom Entertainment, Inc.]]</ref> In time, he defeats the six Robot Masters and recovers their central cores, then confronts Dr. Wily within his [[Asia-Pacific|Pacific]]-based robot factory, where he is manufacturing copies of Light's robots. After defeating replicas of the Robot Masters, as well as several robots designed specifically by Wily to defeat him, Mega Man confronts Wily in a final showdown and defeats him before returning home to his family.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Mega Man |developer=Capcom|publisher=[[Capcom]]|date=December 1987|platform=Nintendo Entertainment System|quote='''Narrator:'''  Mega Man has ended the evil domination of Dr. Wily and restored the world to peace. However, the never ending battle continues until all destructive forces are defeated. Fight, Mega Man! For everlasting peace!}}</ref>

The initial Western release of the game, while keeping the same basic plot, significantly changed some details from the original Japanese manual. In this version, Dr. Light and Dr. Wily (who is portrayed as Dr. Light's former assistant) co-create the [[humanoid robot]] [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]]<ref name="manual">{{cite book |editor=Capcom |title=''Mega Man'' Instruction Booklet |date=December 1987 |publisher=[[Capcom|Capcom Entertainment, Inc.]] | pages=4–15 | id=NES-MN-USA}}</ref> alongside the six Robot Masters, each of whom were designed for the benefit of Monsteropolis's citizens<ref name="npfeature">{{cite magazine | author=''Nintendo Power'' staff| title=''Mega Man - A Star Is Born''| date=November 1992 | issue=42 | pages=20–25|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] | publisher=Nintendo of America | location=Redmond, Washington | issn=1041-9551 | url=https://readcomiconline.to/Comic/Nintendo-Power/Issue-42?id=50393#25}}</ref> (no such place existed in the original plot). Dr. Wily, angered by Light taking credit for their work and desiring to use his creations for criminal purposes, steals the Robot Masters and reprograms them, then creates his own army of robots to seize control of Monsteropolis and declare it his own personal empire. Dr. Light, horrified by Wily's betrayal, sends Mega Man to destroy the Robot Masters and free Monsteropolis from Wily's machines.<ref name="manual"/>

==Gameplay==
[[File: NES Mega Man.png|frame|left|[[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]] makes his way through Cut Man's stage. The player's score is displayed at the top of the screen, and Mega Man's health gauge is displayed on the left.|alt=A square video game screenshot that depicts a blue character sprite firing a shot toward a vertical brick wall. Other sprites surround the character and a score are visible at the top of the screenshot.]]

''Mega Man'' consists of six [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platform]] levels freely chosen by the player. In each level, the [[Player character|player-character]], Mega Man, fights through various enemies and obstacles before facing a "Robot Master" [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the level's end. Upon defeating the boss, the player assimilates the Robot Master's signature attack, or "Special Weapon", into Mega Man's arsenal for the rest of the game.<ref name="npfeature"/> Unlike the standard ''Mega Buster'' (''Rock Buster'' in Japan), the Robot Master powers have limited ammunition replenished by collecting ammunition cells dropped by defeated enemies at random.<ref name="npfeature"/> Enemies also drop energy cells that replenish Mega Man's health gauge.<ref name="manual"/> While the player is free to proceed through the game in any order, each Robot Master is especially vulnerable to a specific weapon, which encourages the player to complete certain stages before others. The player can also revisit cleared levels. Besides the weapons taken from the Robot Masters, the player is able to pick up a platform generator item known as the "Magnet Beam" in Elec Man's stage.<ref name="manual"/><ref name="npfeature"/>

''Mega Man'' also features a [[Score (game)|scoring]] system where players score points for defeating enemies, and earn extra points for collecting [[Power ups|power-ups]] from fallen enemies and for clearing each stage. Each Robot Master was worth a random number between 50,000 and 100,000 points whereas Dr. Wily was always worth 200,000 points.<ref name="manual"/> The scoring system was removed in later ''Mega Man'' games as it was found to provide no meaningful benefit to players and felt unnecessary to designers.

When all six Robot Master stages are completed, the seventh and last stage appears in the middle of the stage select menu.<ref name="manual"/> This stage, in which the player traverses Dr. Wily's robot factory, is a chain of four regular stages linked together, each containing at least one new boss. During these final stages, the six Robot Masters must also be fought again in a predetermined order before the final confrontation against Dr. Wily. As Mega Man's ammo is not restored between stages, every action the player takes is consequential.<ref name="npfeature"/><ref name="GameSpot history">{{cite web | author1=Nutt, Christian | author2=Speer, Justin | name-list-style=amp | title=The History of ''Mega Man'' | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-history-of-mega-man/1100-6076983/ | work=[[GameSpot]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | access-date=April 17, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026090646/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-history-of-mega-man/1100-6076983/ | archive-date=October 26, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Before ''Mega Man'', [[Capcom]] primarily made [[arcade game]]s, and their [[Video game console|console]] releases were mostly [[Video game porting|ports]] of these titles.

The team decided to incorporate [[anime]] elements for the game's animation. Inafune explained, "[Mega Man's] hand transforms into a gun and you can actually see it come out of his arm. We wanted to make sure that the animation and the motion was realistic and actually made sense.

Mega Man was originally able to crouch, but the team decided against it since it made players' ability to determine the height of onscreen projectiles more difficult.<ref name="r20"/> Naoya Tomita (credited as "Tom Pon") began work on ''Mega Man'''s scenic backgrounds immediately after his Capcom training. Tomita proved himself amongst his peers by overcoming the challenges of the console's limited power through maximizing the use of background elements.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hawkins, Matthew | date=August 31, 2011 | title=At Last, The Face Behind The Name TOM-PON Revealed | url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/08/at_last_the_face_behind_the_name_tom_pon_revealed.php | work=GameSetWatch | publisher=[[UBM plc]] | access-date=September 17, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217075418/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/08/at_last_the_face_behind_the_name_tom_pon_revealed.php | archive-date=December 17, 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref>

''Mega Man'' was scored by [[Manami Matsumae]] (credited as "Chanchacorin Manami"),<ref name="soundtrack">{{cite web | author=Greening, Chris | title=Interview with the ''Mega Man 1'' & ''2'' Sound Team: Reunited 20 Years On | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/manamimatsumae.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512135613/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/manamimatsumae.shtml |archive-date=May 12, 2013 | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | access-date=February 19, 2011}}</ref> who composed the music, created the sound effects, and programmed the data in three months, using a sound driver programmed by Yoshihiro Sakaguchi (credited as "Yuukichan's Papa"). The musical notes were translated one by one into the computer language. Matsumae was challenged by the creative limits of three notes available at any one time, and when she was unable to write songs, she created the sound effects.<ref name="soundtrack"/>

When the game was localized for distribution in America, Capcom changed the title of the game from ''Rockman'' to ''Mega Man''. This moniker was created by Capcom's then-Senior Vice President Joseph Morici, who claimed it was changed merely because he did not like the original name. "That title was horrible," Morici said. "So I came up with ''Mega Man'', and they liked it enough to keep using it for the U.S. games."<ref>{{cite journal | author=''Game Players'' staff|title=''Super Mega Man'' ― So What's the Deal? | journal=[[Game Players]] | issue=26 | publisher=[[Future plc|Imagine Media]]| date=March 1993 | page=20 | issn=1091-1685}}</ref> [[1UP.com]]'s Nadia Oxford attributed this change to Capcom's belief that American children would be more interested in a game with the latter title.<ref name="1upanniversary" />

An [[Video game remake|enhanced remake]] titled ''[[Mega Man Powered Up]]'' — known as {{nihongo|''Rockman Rockman''|ロックマン ロックマン}} in Japan — was released worldwide for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] in 2006. The game features a graphical overhaul with 3D [[Chibi (term)|chibi]]-style character models with large heads and small bodies. Inafune had originally planned to make ''Mega Man'' look this way, but could not due to the hardware constraints of the NES.<ref>{{cite web | author=Theobald, Phil | date=September 17, 2005 | title=''Mega Man'' on PSP -- Keiji Inafune and Tatsuya Kitabayashi Interview | url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/articles/651/651835p1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329111321/http://ps2.gamespy.com/articles/651/651835p1.html |archive-date=March 29, 2012 | work=[[GameSpy]]| publisher=IGN | access-date=May 8, 2010}}</ref> Producer Tetsuya Kitabayashi stated that redesigning the character models was a result of the PSP's 16:9 [[widescreen]] ratio.

We wanted cute designs geared towards little kids ... the kinds of characters that you'd see hanging off of keychains and such," character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa explained. "Not only that, I made sure to tell the designers not to skimp on any of the original ''Mega Man'' details. We wanted their proportions and movements to be accurately reflected in these designs as well."<ref name="r203">{{cite book|isbn=978-1-897376-79-9 |date=January 6, 2010 |title=Mega Man: Official Complete Works|publisher=[[UDON|Udon Entertainment]] | pages=108–13}}</ref> As the size of the remake's stages are not proportional to those of the original, the widescreen ratio also presented the developers with more space to fill.<ref name="gamespy2"/>

''Mega Man Powered Up'' features two styles of gameplay: "Old Style" is comparable to the NES version aside from the updated presentation, and "New Style" uses the PSP's entire widescreen and contains storyline cutscenes with voice acting, altered stage layouts, remixed music, and three difficulty modes for each stage. This mode also adds two new Robot Masters (Oil Man and Time Man). The NES version was originally intended to have a total of eight Robot Masters, but was cut down to six due to a tight schedule.<ref name="r203"/> Additionally, the remake lets players unlock and play through the game as the eight Robot Masters, Roll, and Protoman. The New Style stages differ in structure from that of Old Style, with some pathways only accessible to specific Robot Masters. ''Mega Man Powered Up'' also features a Challenge Mode with 100 challenges to complete, a [[level editor]] for creating custom stages, and an option to distribute fan-made levels to the [[PlayStation Network]] online service.<ref>{{cite web | author=Navarro, Alex | date=March 13, 2006 | title=''Mega Man Powered Up'' Review for PSP | url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mega-man-powered-up-review/1900-6145847/ | work=[[GameSpot]]| publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | access-date=June 20, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423054136/http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/rockmanrockman/review.html | archive-date=April 23, 2006 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Castro, Juan | date=March 14, 2006 | title=''Mega Man Powered Up'' - PlayStation Portable Review | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/695/695727p1.html | website=IGN | access-date=May 8, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425021924/http://psp.ign.com/articles/695/695727p1.html | archive-date=April 25, 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Mega Man Powered Up'' received generally positive reviews, with aggregate scores of 83% on [[GameRankings]] and 82 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] {{As of|2010|May|lc = y}}.<ref>{{cite web | title=''Mega Man Powered Up'' for PSP | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/psp/929675-mega-man-powered-up/index.html | work=[[GameRankings]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | access-date=May 8, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729154749/http://www.gamerankings.com/psp/929675-mega-man-powered-up/index.html | archive-date=July 29, 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=''Mega Man Powered Up'' (psp) reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/psp/megamanpoweredup?q=mega_man_powered | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | access-date=May 8, 2010 | archive-date=January 11, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230111061456/http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/psp/megamanpoweredup?q=mega_man_powered | url-status=dead }}</ref> The remake sold poorly at retail, and was later released as a paid download on the Japanese [[PlayStation Network]] digital store<ref name="r203"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Parish, Jeremy |date=May 31, 2007 |title=Mega Manniversary: Mega Morrow |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3159950 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729174553/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3159950 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 29, 2007 |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |access-date=May 9, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | author=''Famitsu'' staff | date=December 15, 2009 | title=『ロックマン』シリーズ4作品がPlayStation Storeで配信決定 | url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1230524_1124.html | magazine=[[Famitsu]] | publisher=[[Enterbrain]] | language=ja | access-date=May 31, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023010414/http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1230524_1124.html | archive-date=October 23, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> and as a bundled with ''[[Mega Man X (video game)|Mega Man Maverick Hunter X]]'' in Japan and North America.
