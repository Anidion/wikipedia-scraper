It is the second arcade game in the ''[[Castlevania]]'' franchise, following ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)#Releases|Vs. Castlevania]]'', an arcade port of the original [[Castlevania (1986 video game)|1986 NES video game]] released in North America. Unlike the previous arcade title in the franchise, ''Haunted Castle'' is not a direct port of an existing console game,  but a newly-developed arcade game running on custom [[Japan Amusement Machine and Marketing Association|JAMMA]]-based board.

The game has the player controlling [[Simon Belmont]], who embarks on a journey to save his wife Selena from the clutches of [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC Haunted Castle (Akumajō Dracula).png|frame|left|Gameplay screenshot]]
''Haunted Castle'' is a [[platform game]] with six stages, which are played through in a linear progression. The player controls the main character, whose primary weapon is a [[whip]]. He must fight various enemies which consist partially of skeletons, zombies, mermen, and hunchbacks. By destroying certain enemies, he can upgrade his primary weapon first to a more powerful spiked [[Morning star (weapon)|morning star]], then to a sword. In addition, various "sub-weapons" can be obtained which provide different means of attack which consist of bombs (powerful ground attack), boomerangs (straight attack), stopwatches (freezes enemies), crosses (powerful straight attack), and torches (continuous ground attack). Hearts are collected to use the sub-weapons. The player can only carry one sub-weapon at a time.

Each of ''Haunted Castle''{{'}}s six levels conclude with a [[boss (video gaming)|boss fight]]. Like in other games of the series, these bosses are generally taken from [[horror fiction|horror]] literature or legend, and include [[Medusa]], [[Frankenstein's monster]], and [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] himself.

Multiple board versions exist, all of which have varying levels of difficulty. Version M is considered the most challenging, Version K and Version J are regarded as being easier to play.<ref name="Castlevania Dungeon"> https://castlevaniadungeon.net/games/hcfaq.txt </ref>

==Development==
===Audio===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2020}}
The soundtrack was composed in part by Kenichi Matsubara, who previously worked on the soundtrack of ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''. There are several music tracks in ''Haunted Castle'' that have been reused in other ''Castlevania'' games. "[[Castlevania#Audio|Bloody Tears]]", first heard in the previously released ''Castlevania II'', is used as the theme for Stage 3. Another arcade piece, the Stage 1 theme "Cross Your Heart", was reused in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]'' under the title "Crucifix Held Close" and as an unlockable song in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood#Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles|Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles]]''. It is part of the "Akumajo Dracula Medley" that appears in Konami's ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3]]'' (originally appearing in the Japanese arcade and PlayStation 2 music game series ''Keyboardmania''), along with "Bloody Tears". "Clockwork's Beat", which plays during Stage 5, was remixed in ''[[Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow]]'' under the name "Underground Melodies" (actually the name of ''Haunted Castle''{{'}}s Stage 4 theme). Finally, "Don't Wait Until Night", played during Stage 6, which borrows hints of "The Silence of Daylight" (the town music from ''Castlevania II''),{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, was remixed in ''[[Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow]]'' for Julius' theme "Heart of Fire", though this particular song is actually a medley of the ''Haunted Castle'' tune and "Heart of Fire" from Stage 5 of the original ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]''.

===Releases===
A [[PlayStation 2]] port of ''Haunted Castle'' was released by game publisher [[Hamster Corporation|Hamster]] in May 2006 as part of the ''[[Oretachi Gēsen Zoku]]'' series. This port was only released in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/games/hc.html|title=Haunted Castle|work=The Castlevania Dungeon|access-date=11 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718214704/http://www.castlevaniadungeon.net/Games/hc.html|archive-date=18 July 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In September 2017, Hamster released the game for the [[PlayStation 4]] as part of their ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' line of digital releases.

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Haunted Castle'' on their April 1, 1988, issue as being the sixth most-popular arcade game at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=329|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 April 1988|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>

Time Extension placed ''Haunted Castle'' last on its list of ranked ''Castlevania'' games. It was described that "It starts off well enough; the sprites are nice and large (a fact that makes it hard to avoid danger) and there are some amazing tunes here. However, the brutal difficulty level is clearly designed to suck in coins, and the controls feel stiff and awkward. [...] Outside of saying you've played it, there's little reason to seek this one out. It's dreadful."<ref>{{cite web |last1=McFerran |first1=Damien |title=Best Castlevania Games - Every Castlevania Game Ranked |url=https://www.timeextension.com/guides/best-castlevania-games-every-castlevania-game-ranked |website=Time Extension |publisher=Hookshot Media |access-date=19 February 2023 |date=2 January 2023}}</ref>
