{{nihongo foot|'''''Street Fighter'''''|ストリートファイター|Sutorīto Faitā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1987 [[arcade video game|arcade]] [[fighting video game]] developed and published by [[Capcom]]. It is the first competitive [[fighting game]] produced by the company and the first installment in the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series. It was a commercial success in arcades and introduced [[Fighting game#Special attacks and combos|special attacks]] and some of the conventions made standard in later fighting games, such as the six-button controls and the use of command-based special moves.

''Street Fighter'' was directed by [[Takashi Nishiyama]], who conceived it by adapting the [[Boss (video games)|boss]] battles of his earlier [[beat 'em up]] game ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' (1984), for a one-on-one fighting game, and by drawing influence from popular Japanese [[Shōnen manga|''shōnen'' manga]]. A [[Porting#Porting of video games|port]] for the [[TurboGrafx-16|TurboGrafx-CD]] was released as {{nihongo foot|'''''Fighting Street'''''|ファイティング・ストリート|Faitingu Sutorīto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in 1988, and was re-released via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]] for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2009.

Its sequel, ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' (1991), evolved its gameplay with phenomenal worldwide success. ''Street Fighter'' also spawned two spiritual successors, Capcom's beat 'em up ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'' (working title ''Street Fighter '89'') and [[SNK]]'s fighting game ''[[Fatal Fury: King of Fighters]]'' (1991), the latter designed by ''Street Fighter'' director Takashi Nishiyama.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Street Fighter.png|thumb|left|[[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] (right) versus [[Characters of the Street Fighter series#Retsu|Retsu]] (left)]]
The player competes in one-on-one matches against a series of computer-controlled opponents or in a single match against another player. Each match consists of three rounds in which the player must knock out an opponent in less than 30 seconds. If a match ends before a fighter is knocked out, the fighter with the greater amount of energy left is the round's winner. The player must win two rounds in order to defeat the opponent and proceed to the next battle. If the third round ends in a tie, then the computer-controlled opponent will win by default or both players will lose. During the [[Single-player video game|single-player mode]], the losing player can continue against the same opponent. Likewise, a second player can interrupt a single-player match and challenge the first player to a new match.

In the [[Arcade cabinet#Deluxe cabinets|deluxe version]] of the [[arcade game]], the player's controls consist of a standard eight-way joystick and two large, unique [[Mechatronics|mechatronic]] pads for punches and kicks that return an analog value depending on how hard the player actuated the control. An alternate version was released that replaces the two punching pads with an array of six attack buttons, three punch buttons, and three kick buttons of different speeds and strengths: light, medium, and heavy.

The player uses the joystick to move left or right, and to jump, crouch, and block. By using the attack buttons and pads in combination with the joystick, the player can perform a variety of attacks from standing, jumping, or crouching positions. Three [[Fighting game#Special attacks and combos|special techniques]] require a specific series of joystick and button inputs:
* {{nihongo|"Psycho Fire"|波動拳|[[Hadouken|Hadōken]]|"Wave Motion Fist"}}
* {{nihongo|"Dragon Punch"|昇龍拳|Shoryūken|"Rising Dragon Fist"}}
* {{nihongo|"Hurricane Kick"|竜巻旋風脚|Tatsumaki Senpū Kyaku|"Tornado Whirlwind Leg"}}.
This is the first game to use such a concept. Unlike its sequels and other [[fighting game]]s, the specific commands for these special moves are not given in the arcade game's instruction card, which instead encourages the player to discover these techniques.<ref name=aac012>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 12</ref>

The single-player mode consists of a series of battles against ten opponents from five different nations.<ref name=aac011>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 11</ref> At the beginning of the game, the player can choose Japan or the United States, and China or England depending on the game's configuration. The player fights two fighters from the chosen country and proceeds to the next country. Two types of bonus games give additional points: [[Breaking (martial arts)|brick breaking]] and table breaking. After defeating the initial eight characters, the player travels to Thailand for the last two opponents.

===Characters===
The player takes control of a young Japanese martial artist named [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]], who competes in the Street Fighter tournament to prove his strength,<ref name=aac345>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 345</ref> and the second player takes control of Ryu's former partner and current rival [[Ken Masters|Ken]], who only jumps into the tournament unqualified to challenge Ryu in two-player matches.<ref name=aac310>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 310</ref> Normally, the player takes control of Ryu in the single-player mode; however, if the player controlling Ken defeats Ryu in a 2-player match, the winning player will play the remainder of the game as Ken. The differences between the two characters are aesthetic, with the same basic moves and special techniques.

The first eight computer-controlled opponents are: from Japan, [[Characters of the Street Fighter series#Retsu|Retsu]], an expelled [[Shorinji Kempo]] instructor,<ref name=aac347>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 347</ref> and [[Characters of the Street Fighter series#Geki|Geki]], a [[Ninja#Gallery|tekkō kagi]]-wielding [[ninja]];<ref name=aac310/> from the United States, [[Characters of the Street Fighter series#Joe|Joe]], an underground [[Full contact karate#American|full-contact karate]] champion,<ref name=aac320>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 320</ref> and [[Characters of the Street Fighter series#Mike|Mike]], a former heavyweight boxer who once killed an opponent in the ring;<ref name=aac340>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 340</ref> from China, [[Characters of the Street Fighter series#Lee|Lee]], an expert in [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese boxing]],<ref name=aac345/> and [[Characters of the Street Fighter series#Gen|Gen]], an elderly professional killer who has developed his own assassination art;<ref name=aac311>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 311</ref> and from England, [[Birdie (Street Fighter)|Birdie]], a tall [[bouncer]] who uses a combination of [[wrestling]] and boxing techniques,<ref name=aac331>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 331</ref> and [[Characters of the Street Fighter series#Eagle|Eagle]], a well-dressed bodyguard of a wealthy family who uses [[Kali sticks]].<ref name=aac299>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 299</ref> After the first eight challengers are defeated, the player is taken to Thailand for the last two adversaries: [[Characters of the Street Fighter series#Adon|Adon]], a deadly [[Muay Thai]] master,<ref name=aac297>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 297</ref> and his mentor [[Characters of the Street Fighter series#Sagat|Sagat]], the reputed "Emperor of Muay Thai" and the game's final opponent.<ref name=aac314>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 314</ref>

==Development==
[[Takashi Nishiyama]] conceived ''Street Fighter'' after working on [[Irem]]'s 1984 [[beat 'em up]] game ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' (called ''Spartan X'' in Japan), which has a number of [[Boss (video games)|boss]] fights; Nishiyama considered making a game centered around them.<ref name="polygon">{{cite web |last=Leone |first=Matt |title=Street Fighter 1: An oral history |url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/7/21270906/street-fighter-1-oral-history-takashi-nishiyama |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |access-date=July 16, 2020 |date=July 7, 2020}}</ref> In turn, the boss fights were inspired by the [[Bruce Lee]]'s [[martial arts film]] ''[[Game of Death]]'' (1972).<ref>{{cite web |last=Gill |first=Patrick |title=Street Fighter and basically every fighting game exist because of Bruce Lee |url=https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2020/9/24/21440150/bruce-lee-movies-street-fighter-fighting-games |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=24 March 2021 |date=24 September 2020}}</ref> Following the success of ''Kung-Fu Master'', Nishiyama was hired by Capcom.<ref name="1up">{{cite web|last=Leone |first=Matt |title=The Man Who Created Street Fighter |url=http://www.1up.com/features/the-man-who-created-street-fighter.html |website=[[1UP.com]] |access-date=14 April 2021 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718180754/http://www.1up.com/features/the-man-who-created-street-fighter |archive-date=18 July 2012}}</ref> He designed an arcade successor for Capcom, ''[[Trojan (video game)|Trojan]]'' (1986), a brawler which evolved the basic gameplay concepts of ''Kung-Fu Master''; the [[NES]] [[Porting#Porting of video games|port]] has a one-on-one fighting mode, for the first time in a Capcom game.<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last=Kalata |first=Kurt |title=Trojan |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/trojan/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=January 29, 2019 |access-date=14 April 2021}}</ref> Nishiyama later designed ''Street Fighter''.<ref name="1up"/> The game was also influenced by the earlier fighting games from 1984 – ''[[Karate Champ]]'' and ''[[Yie Ar Kung-Fu]]''.<ref name="1up"/><ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |last=Stuart |first=Keith |title=Street Fighter and me: Yoshinori Ono on the future of the fighting game |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/apr/09/street-fighter-yoshinori-ono-interview |access-date=12 April 2021 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 April 2012}}</ref> The gameplay of ''Karate Champ'', ''Kung-Fu Master'' and ''Yie Ar Kung Fu'' provided a basic template for ''Street Fighter''.<ref name="sfhistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/sfhistory/history.html |title=The History of Street Fighter |website=GameSpot |access-date=October 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204224001/http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/sfhistory/history.html |archive-date=February 4, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="polygon"/> Nishiyama wanted the game to have a story similar to a film.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Udon|title=ストリートファイター アートワークス 極|year=2012|pages=434 |language=ja |trans-title=Street Fighter Artworks Extreme |isbn=978-4862333810|quote=西山 1対1での戦いを、 実在の格闘技に置き換えてもエンターテインメント性に欠 けると思うんですよ。 より映画的な、 アニメ的な、 小説的な物語性が必要だし、 それ にはハプニング的に勃発する闘いが不可欠だった。 だから 「ストリートファイター(I)」 という名前にしたんです。 ゲームで表現できることって限られているけれど、 どこかド キドキするような物語性を感じ取れるようにしたかったんです。|trans-quote=Nishiyama: I think that even if one-on-one fights were replaced with actual martial arts, it would lack entertainment.

''Street Fighter'' was produced and directed by Takashi Nishiyama (who is credited as "Piston Takashi") and planned by Hiroshi Matsumoto (credited as "Finish Hiroshi"), who both previously worked on the overhead beat 'em up ''[[Avengers (1987 video game)|Avengers]]'' (1987). They would leave Capcom after the production of the game and were employed by [[SNK Playmore|SNK]], developing most of their fighting game series, including ''[[Fatal Fury (series)|Fatal Fury]]'' and ''[[Art of Fighting]]''. They would later work for [[Dimps]] and work on ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'' with Capcom. [[Keiji Inafune]], best known for his artwork in Capcom's ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, got his start at the company by designing and illustrating the character portraits in ''Street Fighter''. Nishiyama drew several inspirations for developing the original gameplay of ''Street Fighter'' from martial art styles he was practicing,<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Power Profiles: Keiji Inafune | date=October 2007 |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] | publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]] | issue=220 |pages=79–81}}</ref><ref name="1up"/> and Inafune based several character designs on the manga ''[[Karate Baka Ichidai]]''.<ref name="IGN" />

The designers at Capcom took inspiration from [[Robert Clouse]]'s 1973 ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', also co-starred by Bruce Lee. That and ''Street Fighter'' are similarly centered around an international fighting tournament, with each character having a unique combination of ethnicity, nationality, and fighting style.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thrasher |first=Christopher David |title=Fight Sports and American Masculinity: Salvation in Violence from 1607 to the Present |date=2015 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-1-4766-1823-4 |page=208 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=77zwCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA208}}</ref> Nishiyama was also inspired by popular Japanese [[Shōnen manga|''shōnen'' manga]] and [[anime]], including an energy attack called Hadouho (lit. the "Wave Motion Gun") from the 1970s anime series ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' as the origin of the [[Hadouken]] move.<ref name="1up"/> The game's title was named after [[Sonny Chiba]]'s ''[[The Street Fighter]]'' (1974).<ref name="IGN">{{cite news |last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |title=IGN Presents the History of Street Fighter |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/16/ign-presents-the-history-of-street-fighter |access-date=31 January 2022 |work=[[IGN]] |date=16 February 2009}}</ref>

==Release==
===Arcade variants===
[[File:Streetfighter Console.jpg|thumb|The [[Pressure measurement#Instruments|pressure-sensitive]] arcade control system]]
The board was based on the [[Motorola 68000]] system, running at 8&nbsp;MHz. Display 384x224. The sound chip was a [[Yamaha YM2151]], paired with a Z80 and two MSM5205.

Two different [[arcade cabinet]]s were sold for the game: a "Regular" version (which was sold as a [[cocktail cabinet]] in Japan and as an upright overseas) with the same six-button configuration later used in the ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' and the [[Arcade cabinet#Deluxe cabinets|deluxe cabinet]] with two [[Pressure measurement#Instruments|pressure-sensitive]] rubber pads, that determine the strength and speed of attacks.

In the worldwide versions, Ryu's and Ken's voices were dubbed so that they yell the names of their moves in English, such as ''Psycho Fire'', ''Dragon Punch'', and ''Hurricane Kick''. Subsequent localized releases until ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'' left the Japanese voices intact; since ''Street Fighter IV'', the series contains English voice acting, and Asian characters use Japanese names for certain special moves and super [[Combo (video games)|combos]] among otherwise English dialogue.

===Home versions===
''Street Fighter'' was ported as ''Fighting Street'' in 1988 for the [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD/CD-ROM²|PC Engine CD-ROM²]] System in Japan<ref name=aac010>''All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000'', pg. 10</ref> and 1989 for the TurboGrafx-CD in North America. There was no six-button controller for the TurboGrafx-CD at the time, so the attack strength is determined by the duration of the button-press, akin to the deluxe arcade version. It has a remastered soundtrack and covers artwork of [[Mount Rushmore]], an in-game location. It was developed by [[Alfa System]] and published by [[NEC|NEC Avenue]] in North America and [[Hudson Soft]] in Japan. This version was re-released via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]] for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] on October 6, 2009, in Japan, November 2, 2009, in North America and November 6, 2009, in [[PAL]] regions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/uKBVi6hn_qT2yeFlFBBYKa8dZJ0glUFW |title=This Week's Downloadable Lineup Truly Sparkles |date=November 2, 2009 |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |access-date=November 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104013244/https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/uKBVi6hn_qT2yeFlFBBYKa8dZJ0glUFW |archive-date=November 4, 2009 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}</ref>

A different Commodore 64 version was developed by Pacific Dataworks and published by Capcom USA. Capcom also published an MS-DOS version in 1989, developed by [[Hi Tech Expressions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/street-fighter |title=Street Fighter for DOS (1988) |publisher=MobyGames |date=2011-05-27 |access-date=2013-01-07}}</ref> Hi-Tech re-released the game as part of the ''Street Fighter Series'' CD-ROM collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/street-fighter-series |title=Street Fighter Series for DOS (1994) |publisher=MobyGames |date=2001-04-19 |access-date=2013-01-07}}</ref>

The arcade game received positive to mixed reviews, with critics praising the combat and graphics but criticizing the pressure-pad controls. Upon release in August 1987, ''[[Commodore User]]'' magazine said it has some of the "most unusual features which make it worthy of note" such as the experimental rubber pad controls and the large 24-inch screen displaying large detailed sprite graphics. However, the review said "the fairly repetitive nature of the game, and the large amount of physical effort needed to play it, will prevent ''Street Fighter'' from being much more than a novel experiment in coin-op technology" but that only "time will tell".<ref name="CU48">{{cite magazine |title=Arcades |magazine=[[Commodore User]] |date=16 August 1987 |issue=48 (September 1987) |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=76, 81 |url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-user-magazine-48/page/n75}}</ref> In September, Tony Thompson of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' said it "breathes new life" into [[martial arts]] games, with a "huge" cabinet, "big" characters, pads where "the harder you hit the pads the harder your character hits" and "secret techniques" but criticized it for making his "hands hurt".<ref name="Crash45">{{cite magazine |last=Thompson |first=Tony |title=Happiness is a Hot Joystick: Street Fighter |magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |date=24 September 1987 |issue=45 (October 1987) |pages=135–137 (137) |url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/75/333/street_fighter_review.html |access-date=9 June 2016}}</ref> In December 1987, [[Julian Rignall]] and Daniel Gilbert of ''Crash'' said "it adds a new dimension with [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] punch buttons" and the action is "gratifying" with "great feedback from the buttons" but "there's very little to draw you back" after the novelty wears off.<ref name="Crash48">{{cite magazine |last=Rignall |first=Julian |authorlink=Julian Rignall |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel |title=A Sally Down the Alley: Street Fighter |magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |date=10 December 1987 |issue=48 (Christmas 1987) |pages=30–32 (31) |url=https://archive.org/details/crash-magazine-48/page/n30}}</ref>

Clare Edgeley of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said in December 1987 that the arcade game had "huge" [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], "among the most realistic" characters, and "intense" action, but requires mastering the controls, including punches, kicks, stoop kicks, flip kicks, and backward flips.
