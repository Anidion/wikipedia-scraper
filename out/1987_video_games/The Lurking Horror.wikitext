'''''The Lurking Horror''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] game released by [[Infocom]] in 1987. The game was written by [[Dave Lebling]] and inspired by the [[horror fiction]] writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (including his [[Cthulhu Mythos]]). The original release was for [[MS-DOS]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari ST]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], and [[Commodore 64]]. It was Infocom's 26th game and the only in the horror genre. Infocom rated it as "Standard" in terms of difficulty. Later, it was ported to the [[Amiga]] with the addition of sound effects, making it the first Infocom adventure with that feature.

==Plot==
The game starts with the player trying to finish a term paper at G.U.E. Tech, a large [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]-like [[United States|American]] [[university]]. The player has braved a snowstorm to travel to the school's [[computer lab]] to work on the report. The document is now mangled beyond repair, however; with the help of a [[Security hacker|hacker]], the player finds that the file has been partially overwritten by the Department of [[Alchemy]]'s files. Although the game begins as a quest to try to salvage the term paper, alarming events soon unfold, revealing a powerful evil within the school's depths.

What began as a mere snowstorm has strengthened into a full-force [[blizzard]]. The player must traverse the University grounds in an attempt to recover the term paper's data.  Much of the [[campus]] is deserted and covered in snowdrifts, rendering walkways impassable. The only accessible avenues are [[utility tunnel|steam tunnels]] and a small complex of buildings. In the course of unraveling the mystery, the player encounters [[demon]]s, [[zombie]]s, and sinister references to a recent campus [[suicide]]. Failing to set things right in the hidden passages beneath the school will result in a literal fate worse than death.

==Development and release==
The name of the university, G.U.E. Tech, is an obvious nod to Infocom's [[Zork]] games, which are set in the Great Underground Empire. In ''The Lurking Horror'', G.U.E. Tech is an abbreviation for "George Underwood Edwards Institute of Technology". Many features of G.U.E. Tech, including the steam tunnels, are modeled after MIT, which many of Infocom's developers attended. In particular, the [[Infinite Corridor]] is a central feature of the MIT campus, and a door marked "Department of Alchemy" actually exists in Building 2 thanks to a late-20th-century hack.<ref>{{cite web | title = IHTFP Hack Gallery: Department of Alchemy Door | url = http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1992/dept_alchemy/alchemy_door.html | access-date = 2008-03-01}}</ref>

All of Infocom's game packages since ''[[Deadline (1982 video game)|Deadline]]'' included extra content in their game packages called "[[feelies]]". The feelies for ''The Lurking Horror'' included: a student ID card; "G.U.E. at a Glance", a guide for freshmen of the school, including maps of the campus and buildings and background information on the school; a rubber centipede-like creature reminiscent of one of the monsters in the game (this was not mentioned on the package, and made for a creepy moment even before the user played the game). In addition to maps and other information necessary to complete the game, the "G.U.E. at a Glance" booklet contains many jabs at technology-oriented schools like MIT and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. These straight-faced jokes include "In spite of what your roommate will tell you, G.U.E. Tech does not have the highest suicide rate in the country" and "Women: There's no need to go anywhere. With a male/female ratio of 6:1, someone WILL say hello to you." G.U.E. Tech's motto, seen on the student ID card in the feelies, is "Omne ignotum pro magnifico", a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "Everything unknown is taken for magnificent.", taken from [[Tacitus]] ([[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]), Book 1, 30.
