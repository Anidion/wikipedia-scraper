'''''Trantor: The Last Stormtrooper''''' is a [[video game]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Atari ST]] released by Go! (a label of [[U.S. Gold]]) in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]]. A version for [[MS-DOS]] was released by KeyPunch Software. It was produced by [[Probe Entertainment|Probe Software]] (the team consisted of David Quinn, [[Nick Bruty]] and [[David Perry (game developer)|David Perry]]). It was released in Spain (as "Trantor") by [[Erbe Software]].

The game is a mix between [[shoot 'em up]] and a [[platform game]], but it was mostly known for its large and well-animated sprites.  Bruty, who had previously produced graphics within tight limits on other projects, decided instead to focus on artwork and keep other aspects of the game simple to fit the constraints of the platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-making-of-trantor-the-last-stormtrooper/|title=The Making Of Trantor: The Last Stormtrooper|last=Jones|first=Darran|date=2 January 2017|website=www.retrogamer.net|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06|quote=As Trantor was my first design, I thought: ‘Screw it. I’m going to blow the entire memory on art and keep the game simple.’}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[image:Trantor game.GIF|thumb|left|ZX Spectrum version|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 2 May 2009}}]] -->
The player controls the titular stormtrooper who is the only survivor of the destruction of his spaceship (hence the title). Gameplay revolves around exploring the play-area and collecting code-letters. The play-area consists of several different floors which can be explored freely via connecting [[elevator|lifts]]. However, Trantor is up against a very strict time limit.

The levels are infested by various aliens and small flying robots which sap Trantor's strength if he touches them. Fortunately, Trantor is armed with a [[flamethrower]] with which to destroy these pests. Unfortunately, fuel for this is limited although he can re-fill this at fuel-points located on many of the floors.

Whenever Trantor finds a code-letter, his timer countdown is reset and then counts down again until he finds another letter. For this reason, much of the gameplay is a race-against-time.

There are also lockers scattered around the floors which contain pick-ups to assist Trantor. These include [[hamburger]]s (restore strength) and clocks (resetting the time, as finding a code letter would).

The game ends when Trantor's energy runs out or if the timer reaches zero.  The player's performance is shown as a percentage of the game completed, along with a short comment. The comment for nine percent is "Is that you, Fergus?", referring to Probe co-founder [[Fergus McGovern]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____138/33|title=Retro gamer №138|website=Issuu|language=en|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>

==Opening sequence==

''Trantor'' was unusual for the time in featuring an animated opening-sequence on loading shown before the main options screen. This shows Trantor's ship (with animated radars) slowly dropping down a shaft before landing. The title character then emerges and is seen to beckon to others to join him before the ship suddenly disintegrates leaving him alone.

CRASH, on the other hand, said the "excellent presentation and graphics conceal shallow gameplay" and gave it an overall 68%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://live.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek/magazines/crash/46|title=World of Spectrum - Crash-46|website=World of Spectrum|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>
