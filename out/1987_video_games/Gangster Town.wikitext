'''Gangster Town''' is a [[light gun]] game developed by [[Sega]] for the [[Master System]] and released in 1987. It is set in an American city overtaken by crime during the 1920s. The player plays a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent armed with a machine gun. The goal is to rid the town of thugs.

The game supports the Sega Light Phaser. Two can be used simultaneously for cooperative play in two-player mode. The game was released in Japan for ''Shooting Zone'', a Master System-compatible [[Arcade_video_game#Technology|arcade]] board dedicated to light gun games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sega.jp/history/arcade/product/7287/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20231013214153/https://www.sega.jp/history/arcade/product/7287/|title=Shooting Zone|website=[[Sega]]|archivedate=October 13, 2023|accessdate=January 21, 2024}}</ref> However, due to the aesthetics of the Arcade cabinet, this version only supports a single light gun.
