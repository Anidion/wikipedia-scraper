'''''Head Over Heels''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] published by [[Ocean Software]] in 1987 for several [[home computer]]s. It uses an [[isometric projection|isometric]] engine similar to the [[Filmation (game engine)|Filmation]] technique first developed by [[Ultimate Play the Game]]. ''Head Over Heels'' is the second isometric game by [[Jon Ritman]] and Bernie Drummond, after their earlier ''[[Batman (1986 video game)|Batman]]'' computer game was released in 1986. The game received favourable reviews and was described by ''Zzap!64'' as an "all time classic".

In 2003, Retrospec released a [[Video game remake|remake]] of ''Head Over Heels'' for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[BeOS]], and [[Linux]]. In 2019, [[Piko Interactive]] released an [[Atari ST]] port of ''Head Over Heels'' for [[Atari Jaguar]]. A [[Nintendo Switch]] port was released in October 2021.<ref>{{cite web|last=Whitehead|first=Thomas|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/10/round-up-18-intriguing-switch-games-shown-in-qubyte-connect-2021|title=Round Up: 18 Intriguing Switch Games Shown In QUByte Connect 2021 — Prepare your virtual wallet|work=[[Nintendo Life]]|publisher=Nlife Media|date=October 29, 2021|access-date=2021-10-29}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Head over heels amstrad 1.png|thumb|250px|left|Heels tries to catch a ride (Amstrad CPC)]]
The player controls two characters instead of just one, each with different abilities.

Head can jump higher than Heels, control himself in the air, and fire [[doughnut]]s from a hooter to paralyze enemies.

Heels can run twice as fast as Head, climb certain staircases that Head cannot, and carry objects around a room in a bag.

These abilities become complementary when the player combines them after completing roughly a sixth of the game. Compared to its predecessors, the game offers unique and revolutionary gameplay, complex puzzles, and more than 300 rooms to explore.

Drummond contributed some famously surreal touches, including robots (controlled by push switches) that bore a remarkable resemblance to the head of [[Charles III]] (then [[Prince of Wales]]) on the body of a [[Dalek]]. Other surreal touches include enemies with the heads of elephants and staircases made of dogs that teleport themselves away as soon as Head enters the room.

==Plot==
Headus Mouthion (Head) and Footus Underium (Heels) are two spies from the planet Freedom. They are sent to Blacktooth to liberate the enslaved planets of Penitentiary, Safari, Book World and Egyptus, and then to defeat the Emperor to prevent further planets from falling under his rule.

Captured and separated, the spies are placed in the prison headquarters of Castle Blacktooth. They must first escape, then break through the market to the orbiting Moonbase. From there they can teleport down to each planet and locate and reclaim the stolen crowns. Liberating the planets and defeating the Emperor will allow Head and Heels to return to Freedom as heroes.

== Development ==
[[Jon Ritman]] re-used and modified the isometric engine he created for ''[[Batman (1986 video game)|Batman]]'' to support the control of 2 players instead of just 1. Modifications were made to the code for the C64 version to lower processor load, but in the end there was little difference between the versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jonritman.f2s.com/games/hoh/index.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710215826/http://www.jonritman.f2s.com/games/hoh/index.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-10|title=Head over Heels|date=2011-07-10|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>
