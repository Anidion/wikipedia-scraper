'''''Alex Kidd: High Tech World''''' is a [[side-scrolling]] [[action-adventure game]] released by [[Sega]] in 1989 for the [[Master System]] as part of the ''[[Alex Kidd]]'' series. It is a modified version of the 1987 Japanese Master System game {{nihongo|'''''Anmitsu Hime'''''|あんみつ姫||"Princess Anmitsu"}}, which was based on [[Anmitsu Hime|a manga series of the same name]].<ref name="HG101"/> The game combines [[Adventure game|adventure]], [[Platform game|platform]], and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle-solving]] elements.<ref name="HG101">Kurt Kalata, [http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/alex-kidd-high-tech-world/ Alex Kidd: High Tech World], Hardcore Gaming 101</ref> 

The English version was not conceived as an Alex Kidd game in Japan and caused inconsistencies for the Alex Kidd storyline in [[Western world|the West]]. Other than Alex, none of the previously established characters in the ''Alex Kidd'' universe are in the game. Alex has a brother James in ''High-Tech World'' who is never mentioned elsewhere.

==Plot==
Alex Kidd is contacted by one of his friends, who tells him a new arcade, High-Tech World, has opened in town. Alex has a map to its location, but it has been torn into eight pieces and is needed to find the arcade before it closes at 5:00 sharp. He solves puzzles, answers questions, runs errands and does housework to find the pieces. However, once he finds the pieces of the map, he learns that the front gates are shut, and thus is unable to leave. Using a [[hang-glider]] to leave the house he lands in the forest. On his way to the arcade, a clan of [[ninja]]s appear, who attempt to attack him. Upon fighting through the forest of ninjas, Alex finally makes it to the Arcade.

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to get through four stages. Half the stages contain puzzles to progress and people to talk to, while the other two are linear levels with enemies along the way. There are a variety of ways to fail in the puzzle stages when Alex has some sort of accident or does something he should not.
