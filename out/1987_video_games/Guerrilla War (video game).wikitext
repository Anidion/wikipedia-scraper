'''''Guerrilla War''''', released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Guevara'''''|ゲバラ}}, is an overhead [[run and gun video game]] developed and published by [[SNK]]. Originally released in 1987 as a coin-operated [[arcade game]], ''Guerrilla War'' was ported to the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[PlayStation Network]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

==Plot==
''Guerrilla War'' followed the adventures of two unnamed rebel commandos ([[Che Guevara]] and [[Fidel Castro]] in the Japanese version) as they raid an unnamed [[Caribbean]] [[Cuba|Island]] in order to free it from the rule of an [[Fulgencio Batista|unnamed tyrannical dictator]]. Along the way the players vanquish hordes of enemy soldiers while attempting to rescue hostages (with large score reductions for any hostages killed in the crossfire), collecting weapons from troopers and operating tanks.

The arcade version, released by SNK in 1987, followed the format of ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' (1986). Using eight-way [[rotary switch|rotary]] joysticks, the game allowed players to move their character in one direction while shooting in another.

The game was moderately successful as it spawned [[porting|ports]] onto home video game systems. [[Data East]] released home editions on the [[IBM PC DOS|PC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Apple II]], while [[Imagine Software]] published the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] ports in Europe. SNK in-house published a version for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES/Famicom]] [[8-bit]] console. Because of the limits of the home platforms, the home versions did not have the rotating joysticks. Both the arcade and home console versions were included on the ''[[SNK 40th Anniversary Collection]]'' for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

The NES version's two-player simultaneous play, unlimited continues, and frantic action gave it an edge over its arcade predecessor. It received a perfect 5-star rating in the book ''Ultimate Nintendo: Guide to the NES Library 1985–1995''<ref name=conti>{{cite book|last=Conti|first=Pat|title=Ultimate Nintendo: Guide to the NES Library 1985–1995|date=15 May 2016|isbn=978-0-9973283-0-1|page=140|publisher=Punk Effect }}</ref> and is also available on [[PlayStation Network]]. This version featured Box cover art by Marc Ericksen, who was also responsible for the cover illustration for SNK's own ''[[Ikari Warriors III: The Rescue]]'' and ''[[P.O.W.: Prisoners of War|P.O.W]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,25/ |title = Marc William Ericksen Video Game Credits and Biography - MobyGames}}</ref>

==Che Guevara connection==
As the original title indicates, the game is based on the exploits of revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], and the defeat of the [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] regime in [[Cuba]] in the late 1950s. In addition, player 2's character was [[Fidel Castro]]. Castro, as he appears in this game, is ranked fifth in ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s list of the top ten video game politicians.<ref>Scott Sharkey, "''EGM''’s Top Ten Videogame Politicians: Election time puts us in a voting mood", ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 234 (November 2008): 97.</ref> Nevertheless, fearing anti-Communist sentiments in the West, SNK did a [[Language localization|localisation]] of the game's dialogue and instruction manual for its North American and European releases. The version of ''Guevara'' released for the Japanese Famicom is a sought-after item for many [[Video game collecting|video game collectors]].

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Guerrilla War'' on their January 15, 1988 issue as being the ninth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=324|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 January 1988|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>
