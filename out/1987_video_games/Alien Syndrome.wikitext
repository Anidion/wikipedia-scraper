{{Nihongo|'''''Alien Syndrome'''''|エイリアンシンドローム|Eirian Shindorōmu}} is a [[run and gun video game]] developed by [[Sega]] and released in arcades in 1987, and later ported to the [[Master System]] in 1988. The game utilizes a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] feature that allows the player to take control of either a male (Ricky) or female (Mary) soldier whilst hunting aliens and saving hostages before they run out of time.

''Alien Syndrome'' released with a strong opening, becoming one of Sega's best-selling video games for the Master System. It received generally positive reviews, with praise towards the gameplay, character designs, sounds, and horror-themed gameplay. It was included as a bonus game in the Genesis compilation game, ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' (2009). A [[Alien Syndrome (2007 video game)|sequel of the same name]] was released in 2007 to a strong negative response from critics.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Alien Syndrome.png|thumb|left|An example of gameplay during the first level, "Round 1". The player is taking control of Ricky whilst fighting alien worms.]]

Two players control two soldiers, named Ricky and Mary, who fight their way through large eight-way scrolling levels while rescuing their comrades who are being held by aliens. At the beginning of each level, a [[time bomb]] is set onboard the infested ship, the players must complete their task before time runs out and the ship is destroyed. After they have rescued a certain number of hostages, the exit opens and they can pass through it in order to fight the [[boss (video gaming)|end-of-level guardian]]. If this monstrosity is defeated before times runs out, they are then able to move onto the next stage. Once all seven levels are completed, the game starts over again with more aggressive aliens, and less time on the countdown to complete the levels.
''Alien Syndrome'' features two player simultaneous gameplay and pickups which assist the player, including better weapons and maps of the current level.

==Ports==
In 1988, the game was [[porting|ported]] to the [[Master System]], [[MSX]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]]/Nintendo Entertainment System (published by [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] without a [[Nintendo]] license). Later, the game was ported to the [[ZX Spectrum]] (1989), [[Game Gear]] (1992), and [[X68000]] (1992).
