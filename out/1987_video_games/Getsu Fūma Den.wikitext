{{nihongo foot|'''''Getsu Fūma Den'''''|{{ruby|月風魔伝|げつふうまでん}}||lit. "''The Legend of Getsu Fūma''"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Konami]] for the [[Family Computer]] in 1987 exclusively in [[Japan]]. It has been referenced in many subsequent Konami titles throughout the years. The game is structurally similar to ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'', ''[[The Goonies II]]'' and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (NES).<ref name="GFDhg101"/>

A [[hack-and-slash]] "[[Roguelike|rogue]][[Metroidvania|vania]]" sequel, titled ''[[Getsu Fūma Den: Undying Moon]]'', was released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] on February 9, 2022 and left Early Access on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] on February 17.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roguevania sidescroller GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon now available for Nintendo Switch; version 1.0 launches on February 17 for Steam|url=https://www.rpgsite.net/news/12376-roguevania-sidescroller-getsufumaden-undying-moon-now-available-for-nintendo-switch-version-10-launches-on-february-17-for-steam|last=Vitale|first=Adam|website=RPG Site|access-date=February 10, 2022}}</ref> A sequel titled '''''Shin Getsu Fūma Den''''' was planned for the [[PlayStation 2]], but was cancelled.

==Gameplay==
The [[Player character|player]] controls Fūma, whose goal is to locate the three Pulse Blades that have been stolen from his clan in order to gain access to Ryūkotsuki's lair. Each of the Pulse Blades have been hidden away in the three neighboring islands surrounding Kyōki-tō, which are {{nihongo|''Kigan-tō''|鬼顔島||"Ogre Face Island"}}, {{nihongo|''Gokumon-tō''|獄門島||"Prison Gate Island"}} and {{nihongo|''Mitsukubi-tō''|三首島||"Three Necks Island"}}. Each of these islands requires Fūma to be in possession of a different {{nihongo|Devil Mask|鬼面符|Kimenfu}}.

The game starts off from an overhead view where the player guides Fūma to his next destination. When Fūma enters a gate, the game switches to a side-scrolling action scene where the player must go from one end of the area to the next while fending off enemies and avoiding pitfalls in the usual matter in order to return to the main field and proceed to the next scene. In addition to these action scenes, there are also small shrines featuring villagers who will provide hints to Fūma and shops where he can purchase new [[Item (game terminology)|items]] and weapons using the money he has accumulated from defeated enemies. The player switches items by pausing the game during an action sequence and then pressing A to select a defensive item or B to change weapons. [[Experience point]]s are accumulated by defeating enemies, which will fill out Fūma's sword gauge, increasing the strength of his attacks.

When the player reaches the main dungeon in each of the islands, the game switches to a pseudo-3D perspective which follows Fūma from behind. The player must proceed through a labyrinth in order to reach the [[Boss (video games)|boss]] holding one of the Pulse Swords. Each labyrinth is filled with numerous enemies who will confront Fūma, along with allies who will provide him with hints and helpful items. A candle is required to light these labyrinths, as well as a compass which shows Fūma's current direction. When the player reaches the boss's lair, the game switches back to a side-scrolling perspective before the actual confrontation.

The game uses a [[Life (video games)|lives system]] like most action games. The player loses a life when he runs out of [[Health (game terminology)|health]] or falls into a pitfall. When the player runs out of lives, they can continue from where they left off or quit and resume at a later point using a [[Password (video games)|password]]. The player is penalized by having their money reduced by half.

==Plot==
In the distant future of 14672 A.D., the first year of the {{nihongo|Demon Age|魔暦元年|Mareki Gan-nen}}, the demon lord {{nihongo|Ryūkotsuki|龍骨鬼}} escaped from hell and plotted to conquer the surface world ruled by the {{nihongo|three Getsu brothers|月氏三兄弟|Getsu-shi San Kyōdai}}. The Getsu brothers fought against Ryūkotsuki, each wielding one of the three spiritual {{nihongo|Pulse Blades|波動剣|Hadōken}} that have been passed within the clan for generations. However, the brothers were ultimately defeated by the demon and only {{nihongo|Fūma|風魔}}, the youngest of the three, survived. Vowing to avenge his slain brothers, Fūma ventures into {{nihongo|Kyōki-tō|狂鬼島|Mad Demon Island}} to recover the three stolen Pulse Blades and summon the spirits of his brothers to defeat Ryūkotsuki.

''Getsu Fūma Den'' was met with mostly positive reception from critics. ''[[Famitsu]]'' noted its mixture of elements from both ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|The Adventure of Link]]'' and ''[[Dragon Buster]]'', with one reviewer stating that it feels like a sequel to ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Akumajō Dracula]]''.<ref name="FamGFD"/> ''[[Tokuma Shoten#Magazines|Family Computer Magazine]]'' wrote that the game evoked "a surprising and mysterious" atmosphere.<ref name="FCMv7i9"/> A writer for Japanese gaming magazine ''Yuge'' commended its graphics, direction and music.<ref name="Yugev7i10"/>

''Hardcore Gaming 101''{{'}}s Kurt Kalata commended the varied visuals and music but criticized the controls and pseudo-3D dungeon crawling sequences for being tedious.<ref name="GFDhg101">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=https://hg101.kontek.net/getsufuu/getsufuu.htm|title=Getsu Fūma Den|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=June 12, 2011|access-date=2021-04-14|archive-date=2018-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203022238/https://hg101.kontek.net/getsufuu/getsufuu.htm|url-status=live|quote=The game is structured as a non-linear action-adventure with some light RPG elements, putting it somewhere in the same realm as ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'', ''[[Zelda II]]'', and ''[[The Goonies II]]''. Several people have noted some similarities between ''Getsu Fūma Den'' and the first [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES video game)|NES ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' games]] - the overworld map, the sound effects, and the way Fūma controls similarly to Leonardo, right down to his overhead slashes - lead many to believe that it's sort of a spiritual successor.}}</ref> However, the Japanese book ''200 Unreasonable Famicom & Sufami Games You Want to Clear Before You Die'' gave the game a negative retrospective outlook. While similarities with ''[[Genpei Tōma Den]]'' were pointed out and the overall originality on-display was also commended, they heavily criticized the password system and drawbacks with its gameplay.<ref name="200UFaSFGYWtCBYD">{{cite book|chapter=月風魔伝|trans-chapter=Getsu Fūma Den|title=死ぬ前にクリアしたい200の無理ゲー ファミコン&スーファミ編|trans-title=200 Unreasonable Famicom & Sufami Games You Want to Clear Before You Die|series=My Way Mook|publisher=My Way Publishing|date=October 10, 2018|page=32|language=ja|isbn=978-4865119855}}</ref>
