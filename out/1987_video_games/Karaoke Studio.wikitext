{{nihongo|'''''Karaoke Studio'''''|カラオケスタジオ|Karaoke Sutajio|lead=yes}} is a [[karaoke]] [[music video game]] designed for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]], or Famicom. The game is packaged with a hardware expansion subsystem designed to be inserted into the Famicom cartridge slot, and with a microphone peripheral capable of detecting a human voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/nes/action/karaokestudio/index.html|title=Karaoke Studio|publisher=}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Several levels of the game can be played on the hardware expansion subsystem alone. Additionally, smaller expansion cartridges (originally available for separate purchase) providing additional levels and other new content can be plugged directly into the ''Karaoke Studio'' subsystem.

Gameplay consists of singing along in a [[karaoke]]-manner to a series of [[J-pop|Japanese pop songs]], which have been converted to the Famicom's synthetic audio format. The player is scored on accuracy of singing. As the music plays, the screen displays the song's lyrics upon a graphical depiction of the song's themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index7.shtml|title=GameSpy: PC Games, Reviews, News, Previews, Demos, Mods & Patches|publisher=|access-date=2008-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920034157/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index7.shtml|archive-date=2008-09-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Several [[expansion pack|expansion cartridges]] were progressively released providing new songs not contained on the original subsystem. These expansion cartridges are smaller in size and plug directly into the ''Karaoke Studio'' subsystem.
