''Into the Eagle's Nest'' is a game in which the [[player character]] is an Allied soldier who must infiltrate the four castles that comprise the top-secret [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] fortress known as the Eagle's Nest, rescue three [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] saboteurs being held in three of the castles, recover the art treasures stolen by the Nazis, and then use explosives to destroy the fourth castle.<ref name="Dragon128"/>

==Gameplay==
The player uses a joystick for control, using the firing button to fire the machine gun, which carries ammunition to allow for 99 shots. Nazis are killed when hit by two well-placed shots, although Nazis sitting at a table are killed with a single well-placed shot. The player can survive up to 50 shots from Nazi soldiers. Inside the castles, the player can discover crates which may contain art objects or explosives. The player can also find ammunition dumps, first-aid kits, and food in the castles.<ref name="Dragon128"/>

==Release==
The game was originally programmed by Andrew Challis for the [[Commodore 64]], and by Kevin Parker for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], and [[ZX Spectrum]], with graphics by Robin Chapman for all formats. It was initially released in 1987 by [[Interceptor Micros#The Pandora label|Pandora]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The game was also licensed by [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]] for release in the [[United States]], who handled the [[Apple II]] port by Andrew Pines and [[IBM PC compatible]] port by Visionware.

In 1988, [[Atari Corporation]] published a cartridge version for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] as part of the [[Atari XEGS]] release line-up.

''[[Compute!]]'' called ''Into the Eagle's Nest'' "a good, solid arcade game" but criticized it for not allowing save games during most of the game, and stated that receiving points for killing drunken, unconscious Nazi soldiers seemed like "cold-blooded murder".<ref name="randall198711">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-11-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_090_1987_Nov#page/n33/mode/2up | title=Into The Eagle's Nest | work=Compute! | date=November 1987 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Randall, Neil | pages=32}}</ref> The game was reviewed in 1987 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #128 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column.

Tracie Forman Hines reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Into the Eagle's Nest'' was some of the best fun this jaded critic has had in ages and it is a game that most people will go back to time after time. Strategic shootout fans will find this one a blast."<ref name="CGW43">{{cite magazine |last=Forman Hines |first=Tracie |title=An Adventure Gamer Looks "Into The Eagle's Nest" |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January 1988 |volume=1 |issue=43 |pages=10}}</ref>

A 1991 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' survey of strategy and war games gave it two and a half stars out of five, stating that it was "fun for a short time, but rapidly loses its interest appeal".<ref name="brooks199111">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=88 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: The 1900-1950 Epoch / Part I (A-L) of an Annotated Paiktography | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
