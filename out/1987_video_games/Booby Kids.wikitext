==Gameplay==

''Booby Kids'' is a game played from an overhead perspective, with the player taking on the role of one of the titular Booby Kids, named for their ability to instantly dig [[booby trap]]s in front of where they stand and bury hostile enemies that attempt to seek out and ultimately destroy the Booby Kids. Compared to ''Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen'', the levels in ''Booby Kids'' feature more of a reliance on puzzle-solving in addition to the maze like structures of the original game.

Levels range from the conventional [[prehistory]] setting of the first four levels to [[feudal Japan]] and even some [[futurism|futuristic]] levels inspired by [[science fiction]].<ref>[http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14764 Overview of ''Booby Kids''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115035825/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14764 |date=2014-11-15 }} at [[allgame]]</ref> There are 21 levels in this game with five different bonus levels to gain extra points in. Objects to acquire in the other time zones include coconuts (in the prehistoric era), ancient Japanese scrolls (in feudal Japan), radios (in the [[World War II]] era), bags of money (in the modern era), and computer monitors (retrieved in the future era).<ref>[http://www.somethingawful.com/d/rom-pit/booby-kids.php Advanced overview of ''Booby Kids''] at Something Awful</ref>
