==Trivia==
{{Trivia|section|date=May 2021}}
*The car featured is a red [[Mazda RX-7]] for right-hand driving countries.
*Director Hiroyuki Sakou went on to create Taito's ''[[Operation Thunderbolt (video game)|Operation Thunderbolt]]'' a year later.
*This game was the forerunner of the Taito Z system on which Taito's driving games were based from 1988–91.
*Some of the billboards in ''Full Throttle''/''Top Speed'' are plugs for other Taito games such as ''[[Operation Wolf]]'' and ''Plump Pop''.
*One of the billboards in ''Full Throttle''/''Top Speed'' features two detectives who are obvious references to Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs from ''[[Miami Vice]]''. Taito released the similar ''[[Chase H.Q.]]'' the following year, which also featured ''Miami Vice''-esque detectives.
*This game has a copyright notice in the Japanese release. US and World ''Top Speed'' releases do not have this screen.
