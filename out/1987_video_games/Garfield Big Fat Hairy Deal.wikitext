'''''Garfield: Big Fat Hairy Deal''''' is a 1987 [[computer game]] for the [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and the [[Amiga]] based on the [[comic strip]] ''[[Garfield]]''. It is the second video game based on [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]' ''Garfield'' comics to be released, following 1986's ''[[Create with Garfield]]''.

==Plot and gameplay==
[[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] must rescue his girlfriend Arlene from the cat pound and then return to [[Jon Arbuckle]]'s map. He starts his quest in Jon's house, venturing through streets, dark alleys, convalescent homes, and sanitary sewers to find Arlene. Various objects are littered along the way, and Garfield meets characters such as [[Odie]], Nermal and giant rats, whom can help or hinder his quest.

In some versions of this game, the background graphics are only in black and white, while the [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] show a little color. In other versions (i.e. the [[Commodore 64]] version), the graphics are all full color.

''[[Zzap!64]]'' reviewing the C64 version complemented the graphics, particularly the characters, calling them "Large, beautifully animated", but criticised the repetitive level design and lack of replay value.<ref name=Z64 />

Nic Outterside, writing in  ''[[Atari ST User]]'', found that the game had "you in stitches of laughter", employed "suburb graphics and animation", was "a delight to play", and thought it was one of the most enjoyable games he had played in 1988.<ref name=ASTU />
