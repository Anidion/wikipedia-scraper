'''''Eco''''' is a [[Wire-frame model|wire-frame]] 3D [[evolution]] [[life simulation game]] developed by [[Denton Designs]] for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]]. It was released in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] and published by [[Ocean Software]].

The player uses a mouse or joystick to control an insect, which must avoid predators, find food, and then find another insect of the same species and mate with it. The player can then unlock one of several "[[gene]]s", altering the value of which changes their creature. Some changes are only cosmetic and leave the creature in the same species; others can, for instance, make the initial insect a new species<ref>{{Cite web |title=Eco review (Atari ST) |url=https://www.atarilegend.com/reviews/110 |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=Atari Legend |language=en}}</ref> with wings and capable of flight. After unlocking multiple genes the player can become a fast dog-like quadruped, a bird, a scorpion or a humanoid. The game does not end until the player starves, is killed by another creature, or deliberately "evolves" into a plant.
