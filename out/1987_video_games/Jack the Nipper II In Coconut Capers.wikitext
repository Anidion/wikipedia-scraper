'''''Jack the Nipper II: In Coconut Capers''''' is a [[video game]] by [[Gremlin Graphics]] released in 1987 for [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[MSX]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Jack the Nipper]]''. As with the previous game, ''Jack the Nipper II'' is a side-view [[flip screen]] game with puzzle solving and platform elements. The false-[[3D graphics|3D]] effect has been removed, making the gameplay pure [[2D graphics|2D]].

==Plot==
Following his naughty exploits in ''[[Jack the Nipper]]'', Jack and his family have been exiled to [[Australia]]. Unhappy with this, Jack has jumped from the plane, using his [[nappy]] as a parachute. He finds himself in the middle of the [[African jungle]], surrounded by dangerous animals and natives. His father is also following close behind, determined to give his boy a good spanking. Jack must cause as much mischief as possible while avoiding punishment.

==Gameplay==
Jack must again perform naughty pranks—this time on the human and animal inhabitants of the jungle—while evading his father who is in hot pursuit.

* ''[[Your Sinclair]]'': <blockquote>"... another little spanker from Gremlin. As always with that company, the graphics are immaculate - colourful and with clash down to a minimum... And the jokes - well, hilarious, as always. Leave Jack for a moment and he'll start raking around in his nostril - bleugghhh! Quite what he does with the contents is never made clear..."<ref name="Your Sinclair Review">{{Citation|title=Jack the Nipper II Review|newspaper=[[Your Sinclair]]|date=December 1987}}</ref></blockquote>
* ''[[Sinclair User]]'': <blockquote>"The music, [[Henry Mancini]]'s ''[[Baby Elephant Walk|March of the Baby Elephants]]'', is cleverly done, but not so cleverly that you don't want to use the OFF option after a few minutes. As with most games of this type, my main complaint is that it's much too complicated to solve at one sitting, and there's no SAVE option. Just Gremlin Graphics being naughty, I suppose".<ref name="Sinclair User Review">{{Citation|title=Jack the Nipper II Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|date=December 1987}}</ref></blockquote>

The game was reviewed in 1990 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #158 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column, as part of the [[Mastertronic]] MEGA Pack of 10 games previously released in Europe. The reviewers gave the game 3½ out of 5 stars, calling it "a rather cute arcade game that has the on-screen character running around in Africa".<ref name="Dragon158">{{Citation
