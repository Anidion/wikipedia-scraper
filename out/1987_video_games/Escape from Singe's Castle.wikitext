'''''Escape from Singe's Castle''''', also known as '''''Dragon's Lair Part II - Escape From Singe's Castle''''', is a 1987 video game from [[Software Projects]]. The game is sometimes referred to as ''Dragon's Lair II'', but is not the official arcade sequel ''[[Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp]]''.

== Gameplay ==
Players control Dirk the Daring, the player character from ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'', who has returned to the lair of Singe the dragon in order to claim a pot of gold. Singe has laid traps throughout his lair, forcing players to guide Dirk across a number of differently themed screens in order to steal the gold and escape.<ref name="preview">{{cite magazine | last=Walker | first=Andy | title = Reviews - Escape From Singe's Castle - Dragon's Lair II| magazine = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| issue = 39 | pages = 120| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications Ltd]]| date = April 1987 | url=https://archive.org/details/Crash_No._39_1987-04_Newsfield_GB/page/n119/mode/2up | accessdate = 2016-04-23}}</ref> In the 8 bit versions, there are eight different levels.

In the 16-bit version, Dirk is supposed to rescue Daphne again, this time from the Shapeshifter. Unlike the earlier 8-bit version, this is a [[cartoon]]-based [[interactive movie]], like its predecessor, where the player is supposed to choose the correct movement for Dirk in the right time.<ref name="CGW92"/>

== Development ==

[[Bethesda Softworks]] developed the [[MS-DOS]] version of the game in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/game-pro-uk-07/page/70/mode/2up|title=Bethesda A brief History|magazine=[[GamePro]]| date=March 1996 |page=71|accessdate=July 12, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bethsoft.com/html/about2.html|title=Bethesda Softworks History|publisher=bethsoft.com|accessdate=December 12, 2021|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970605103153/http://www.bethsoft.com/html/about2.html|archivedate=June 5, 1997}}</ref> 

An [[Apple IIGS]] version had reportedly been completed by ReadySoft and scheduled to be released in 1991 (manuals from other ports list detailed IIGS-specific loading instructions and features),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://retro-commodore.eu/files/downloads/amigamanuals-xiik.net/Games/Dragon%27s%20Lair%20-%20Escape%20from%20Singe%27s%20Castle%20-%20Manual-ENG.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20240203104722/https://retro-commodore.eu/files/downloads/amigamanuals-xiik.net/Games/Dragon%27s%20Lair%20-%20Escape%20from%20Singe%27s%20Castle%20-%20Manual-ENG.pdf|title=Manual|website=retro-commodore.eu|access-date=February 3, 2024|archivedate=February 3, 2024}}</ref> but was never publicly released. In 2022, decades later with the original ReadySoft port still missing or lost, Brutal Deluxe created and released a new Apple IIGS port based on the PC version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brutaldeluxe.fr/products/apple2gs/dragonslair1/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20220504004305/https://brutaldeluxe.fr/products/apple2gs/dragonslair1/index.html|title=Brutal Deluxe releases Dragon's Lair: Escape From Singe's Castle for Apple IIGS |archivedate=May 4, 2022|accessdate=2022-05-30}}</ref>

Allen L. Greenberg reviewed the ReadySoft game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Dragon's Lair II: Escape From Singe's Castle'' is an odd creature, an exceptional program which suffers from uninteresting game-play."<ref name="CGW92">{{cite magazine |last=Greenberg |first=Allen L. |title=As the Worm Turns - ReadySoft's Dragon's Lair II: Escape from Singe's Castle |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=March 1992 |volume=1 |issue=92 |page=74 |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_92.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511023432/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_92.pdf |archivedate=May 11, 2013}}</ref>
