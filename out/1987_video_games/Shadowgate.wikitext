'''''Shadowgate''''' is a black-and-white [[point-and-click game|point-and-click]] [[adventure game]] published for the [[Macintosh]] as part of the [[MacVenture]] series. The game is named for its setting, Castle Shadowgate, residence of the evil [[Warlock]] Lord. The [[player character|player]], as the "last of a great line of hero-kings" is charged with the task of saving the world by defeating the Warlock Lord, who is attempting to summon up the demon Behemoth out of Hell. Later that year, a color version of the game was released for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]], and in 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2023}}

[[File:Shadowgate screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The beginning of the game (Macintosh)]]

The [[player character|player]] must solve a series of [[logic puzzle|puzzles]] throughout the castle to proceed to the Warlock Lord's chamber. Due to the castle's perilous nature, at least one lit torch must be in the player's possession at all times. If the torch is extinguished, the player soon stumbles, breaking his neck, and must then continue from a [[saved game]] (or the area in which they died, in game console versions). Only a finite number of torches are to be found throughout the game, which effectively acts as a time limit to proceedings. Various items that can be acquired include a sword, a sling and other ancient weapons; though these weapons can not actually be used as striking weapons, they can be clicked on at the appropriate time to deliver a fatal blow to specific enemies.

The game has many opportunities for death, including being burned by a dragon's breath, attacked by a cyclops, sucked into outer space through a broken mirror, dissolved by acidic slime, mauled by a wolf-woman, eaten by sharks, and suicide. Virtually any action taken by the player which is not the correct solution to a puzzle will result in a fatality. These deaths were often graphically described in the game's text (along with often sardonic and humorous comments), even in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version (in spite of [[Nintendo]]'s policy of [[censorship]] at the time). Many of the game's puzzles rely on a system of [[trial and error]], the problem of which is overcome by the ability to save the game state (as in most [[adventure game]]s). Subtle hints can be found in books and the descriptive [[Macventure#Features|game texts]]. In the NES version, these are replaced by an outright hint feature which gives vague clues about what is noteworthy in any given room in the castle. The further the player progresses, however, the more useless this feature becomes, deteriorating into nothing but encouraging messages by the game's end. The NES version of ''Shadowgate'' is one of the few NES games with a [[Swedish language]] version.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|section|date=March 2023}}

At the very beginning of ''Shadowgate'', the only information the game provides to the player is:

{{blockquote|The last thing that you remember is standing before the wizard Lakmir as he gestured wildly and chanted in an archaic tongue. Now you find yourself staring at an entryway which lies at the edge of a forest. The Druid's words still ring in your ears: Within the walls of the Castle Shadowgate lies your quest. If the prophecies hold true, the dreaded Warlock Lord will use his dark magic to raise the Behemoth, the deadliest of the Titans, from the depths of the earth. You are the seed of prophecy, the last of the line of kings, and only you can stop the Warlock Lord from darkening our world FOREVER. Fare thee well.<ref name="Shadowgate-Computer">{{cite video game

It is then up to the player to gather more information about the world through examining objects and reading any scrolls or books they come across.  While reading some of the in-game books and scrolls is necessary to finish the game, others only provide exposition about the world ''Shadowgate'' takes place in. Reading the book ''Before Shadowgate'', the comic book ''Shadowgate Saga: Raven'', and playing the sequels ''[[Beyond Shadowgate]]'' and ''[[Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers]]'' reveals more details.

''Shadowgate'' takes place in the fictional world of "Tarkus" ("Tyragon" in the ''Before Shadowgate'' novel, also known as "Terrakk”, the Kal Torlinese term for "Earth") where creatures from fantasy and myth live. In the land of "Kal Zathyn" (according to the novel), on top of "Gatekeeper Mountain", is the living castle of "Shadowgate" where a group of powerful wizards known as the "Circle of Twelve" once met. One of the Circle of Twelve, "Talimar", became corrupt and was removed from the Circle. After that, he began to call himself "The Warlock Lord" and caused chaos across the lands by inciting conflict between humans, elves, dwarves, and the races on Tyragon. After those wars ended and the land began to rebuild, the Warlock Lord amassed an army of followers, including trolls, orcs, goblins, and other creatures. He waged war against the Kings of the Lands, and was defeated when the rest of the Circle of Twelve intervened. They sealed the Warlock Lord inside the caverns underneath Shadowgate, and then disbanded. The only wizard who remained was "Lakmir", who took on the role of Tyragon's guardian to ensure that the Warlock Lord's evil would not threaten the Lands again.

Years later, the Warlock Lord escaped from his confinement, and planned to raise the mightiest of titans, the Behemoth, from the depths of darkness to serve him. With the Behemoth, the Warlock Lord would escape Castle Shadowgate, and terrorize the planet once more. To keep this from happening, Lakhmir sought out the last of the "Line of Kings", also known as "The Seed of Prophecy", who was foretold to stop the Warlock Lord and the Behemoth. Doing so would require the "Staff of Ages", a powerful artifact with enough power to slay the Behemoth that was hidden within Shadowgate.  After finding this hero, Lakhmir sends him to the entrance of Shadowgate to begin his quest.

It is up to the player to take on the role of "The Seed of Prophecy", enter Castle Shadowgate, solve its puzzles, survive its many traps, and stop the Warlock Lord once and for all. If they survive to the end, they will come across the Warlock Lord just as he succeeds in opening the gates of Hell and summoning the Behemoth. If the player was successful in finding and assembling the holy artifact called the Staff of Ages by this point, then they would be able to mortally wound the demon with it. As it dies, the Behemoth then drags the Warlock Lord with him into Hell. The player returns victorious, where he is [[betrothed]] to the [[monarch|King]]'s daughter and entitled High Lord of the Westland.

==Ports==
''Shadowgate'' was originally released for Macintosh in 1987 and ported to other computers, including a color version of the game for the [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] later in 1987. In 1988 it was released for [[MS-DOS]] and in 1989 for the Apple [[IIGS]]. It made its first console appearance later that year on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The success of ''Shadowgate'' on the NES prompted [[ICOM Simulations]] to have [[Kemco]]/[[Seika]] port the other MacVenture titles to the console, including ''[[Déjà Vu (video game)|Déjà Vu]]'' and ''[[Uninvited (video game)|Uninvited]]''. In 2018, the NES port was released (alongside ''Déjà Vu'' and ''The Uninvited'') to the PC, Xbox One and Playstation 4 in a collection called ''8-Bit Adventure Anthology: Volume 1'' by Abstraction Games.

In 1992, an enhanced version of the game was released for [[Windows 3.1x]].

Later in 2024, the game will be ported to the [[Playdate (console)| Playdate]] handheld console.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pocketgamer.com/playdate/official-port-of-shadowgate-2024/ | title = An official port of Shadowgate is coming to the Playdate in 2024 | last = Gregson-Wood | first =  Stephen | publisher = [[pocketgamer]] | date = 2023-10-05 | access-date = 2024-05-08}}</ref>

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave the game a very positive review, noting the game uses the same superior interface as prior MacVenture games. The difficulty was noted as a step up from ''[[Deja Vu: a Nightmare Comes True|Deja Vu]]'' and ''[[Uninvited (game)|Uninvited]]'', but ''Shadowgate'' was also said to be more flexible, allowing more than one solution to some puzzles.<ref name = "CGW">{{Cite magazine | date = November 1987 | url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_41/page/n40/mode/1up?view=theater | last = Hines | first = Tracie Forman | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Shadowgate: Inside the Castle Shadowgate  | pages = 41, 57 }}</ref>

The game was reviewed in 1987 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #128 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers stated that "''Shadowgate'' is a great adventure game in that you must continually be aware of what’s already been accomplished to complete subsequent puzzles". The reviewers gave the game 5/5 stars.<ref name="Dragon128">{{cite journal

''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''Shadowgate'', praising its extensive gameplay, stating that "so much is jammed into these two disks that nearly everyone should find this game appealing ... ''ShadowGate'' plays easily and instinctively". ''Macworld'' also praises ''Shadowgate's'' graphics and sound, calling the graphics "expertly crafted", but express that they "[tend] to lack originality", and call the sound effects "far better than those of most adventure games". ''Macworld'' calls ''Shadowgate'' "technically, visually, and aurally superior to most of its competition" but criticizes the game's mood, stating that it doesn't "take itself seriously enough to create a mood of mystery", and also lacks the 'tongue-in-cheek' humor of other adventure games, creating a feeling of something "lacking".<ref>{{cite magazine|last = McCandless|first = Keith|title = More Castle Hassles: ShadowGate 1.0 Review|date = September 1987|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_8709_September_1987/page/n173 |magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|page = 168}}</ref>

In 1996, Infinite Ventures acquired from Viacom, the rights to Shadowgate and other games originally developed by ICOM Simulations. ICOM Simulations had been acquired by Viacom in 1994 but had published no updates to the original products. After the acquisition, Infinite Ventures ported the game to other operating systems (Windows '95/'98/2000/Me) and portable systems (Windows CE P/PC, Palm OS, and Pocket PC) under the name of ''Shadowgate Classic''. These versions had a new interface and menu layout, with artwork based on the 1996 Windows versions.

In 1999, Infinite Ventures licensed the NES version of ''Shadowgate'' to KEMCO and it was ported to the [[Game Boy Color]] with enhanced sprites and animations also under the name of ''Shadowgate Classic''.

In 2005, a mobile phone version of the game was released by Vindigo Entertainment. Once again using the name of ''Shadowgate Classic'', this version featured brand new graphics, puzzles, challenges, and areas.

In 2006, Infinite Ventures licensed the rights to the ICOM simulations portfolio to Zojoi, a company formed by Shadowgate's original game designers, Dave Marsh and Karl Roelofs. In October 2012, [[Zojoi|Zojoi, LLC]] launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to secure funding for a remake of ''Shadowgate''.  Original game creators Dave Marsh and Karl Roelofs appeared in the pitch video and showed pre-production footage of the game in development. They set a [[crowd-funding]] goal of $120,000.<ref name="Shadowgate Kicktraq">{{cite web

===Sequels===

In 1991, a novel written under the pen name "F.X. Nine" called ''Before Shadowgate'', was published by [[Scholastic Corporation]] as part of the ''[[Worlds of Power]]'' series of video game novelizations of third party Nintendo Entertainment System games. The novel acts as a prequel to the game, and featured contributions from ''Shadowgate'' co-creators [[Dave Marsh (game developer)|Dave Marsh]] and [[Karl Roelofs]], who provided important details and information to the book's author.

There have been two sequels to the game. The first, ''[[Beyond Shadowgate]]'', was released for the [[TurboGrafx-16]] in 1993 and the second, ''[[Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers]]'', for the [[Nintendo 64]] in 1999. Another N64 sequel, ''[[Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers#Sequel|Shadowgate Rising]]'', was well into development, but the project was scrapped when Nintendo announced the console which would become the [[GameCube]].

On September 16, 2021, 317 Games launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for Shadowgate, The Living Castle, a board game based on the Shadowgate series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.317films.com/shadowgate-the-living-castle |title=Shadowgate, The Living Castle is coming to Gencon 2021!! |publisher=317 Games |date=2021-09-16 }}</ref>

In October 2021, Zojoi and Azure Drop Studios released ''Shadowgate VR: The Mines of Mythrok'', an exclusive [[Oculus Quest]] title.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/08/shadowgate-vr-the-mines-of-mythrok-coming-to-oculus-quest-in-october/ |title=Shadowgate VR: The Mines of Mythrok Coming to Oculus Quest in October |publisher=VR Focus |date=2021-08-26 |access-date=2021-11-03 |archive-date=2021-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210926170521/https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/08/shadowgate-vr-the-mines-of-mythrok-coming-to-oculus-quest-in-october/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On January 22, 2023, Zojoi announced a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for ''Beyond Shadowgate'', the official sequel to the NES version of ''Shadowgate''. A video from series co-creator Dave Marsh notes this project uses the original design documents from 1990 and is unrelated to the TurboGrafx-16 game.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Beyond Shadowgate |url=https://www.zojoi.com/beyond-shadowgate/ |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=Zojoi |language=en-US}}</ref>
