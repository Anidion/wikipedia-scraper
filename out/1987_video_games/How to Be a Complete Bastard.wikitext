'''''How to be a Complete Bastard''''' is a 1986 book by [[Adrian Edmondson]], Mark Leigh and [[Michael Lepine|Mike Lepine]]. {{ISBN|0-86369-182-X}} {{ISBN|978-0863691829}} 

The book was a spin-off from Adrian Edmondson's character Sir Adrian Dangerous one of the Dangerous Brothers, a TV and stage show performed with Rik Mayall and contained a selection of ways to be a "complete bastard" to those around you. Some examples are:
* "How to be a Bastard Student:" Join the Free [[Nelson Mandela]] Society today to claim your free Nelson Mandela. ''(note: at the time of publication nearly every UK university had a society of that name campaigning for the release of Nelson Mandela)''
* "How to be a Bastard Parent:" ''Things babies are good for:'' Filling their pants with shit. (That's about it really) ''What to do if baby cries:'' 1) Put on an [[Iron Maiden]] album 2) Listen to it at full volume
* "How to be a Complete Bastard to the Deaf:" Go like this: ''(sequence of cartoons depicting [[sign language]] alphabet gestures spelling "FUCK OFF")'' Alternatively, go like this: ''(single cartoon depicting [[V-sign]] gesture)''

It was followed up with ''How to be a Complete Bitch'' by [[Pamela Stephenson]] with Leigh and Lepine in 1987, and ''[[The Complete Bastard's Book of the Worst]]'', again written by Edmondson, in 1988.

The book was also turned into a [[video game]] for [[ZX Spectrum]],<ref>{{WoS game|id=0002366}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/howtobeacompletebastard.htm |title=Your Sinclair #23, Nov 1987 |access-date=2007-05-28 |archive-date=2007-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805210641/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/howtobeacompletebastard.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Amstrad CPC]]<ref>[http://www.cpczone.net/index.php?game=1058 CPC Zone: How to be a Complete Bastard]</ref> and [[Commodore 64]],<ref>[http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=1234 Lemon 64: How to be a Complete Bastard]</ref><ref>[http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=32&page=150 Zzap issue 32, page 150]</ref><ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/how-to-be-a-complete-bastard Moby Games: How to be a Complete Bastard]</ref> as well as a board game published by Paul Lamond Games Ltd.<ref>[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/11155 BoardGameGeek: How to be a Complete Bastard]</ref>
