'''''Nemesis the Warlock''''' is a comic series created by writer [[Pat Mills]] and artist [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] which appeared in the pages of the British weekly [[comics anthology]] ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''. The title character, a fire-breathing demonic [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], fights against the fanatical [[Torquemada (comics)|Torquemada]], Grand Master of the Terran Empire in Earth's distant future, and his attempts to exterminate all alien life.

==Publication history==

The series began in 1980, in prog 167 of ''2000 AD'', with a story called ''Comic Rock'' "The Terror Tube", in which a freedom fighter called Nemesis escaped from Torquemada, the chief of the Tube Police, after a protracted chase through a complex travel-tube system on a planet called Termight, later revealed to be Earth ("Mighty Terra"). All that was seen of Nemesis was the outside of his streamlined organic spaceship, the Blitzspear. In "Terror Tube" the police were portrayed as a cross between the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (Torquemada is named after the notorious inquisitor [[Tomás de Torquemada]]) and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (or from Spanish Easter penitents), making it easier to position them as the villains.

"Terror Tube" was the first of a planned series of one-offs inspired by popular music, called "Comic Rock" – in this case [[The Jam]]'s "[[Going Underground]]". The series never got going, but did produce a second Nemesis story, a two-parter called "Killer Watt", in which Torquemada chased Nemesis through a bizarre [[Teleportation|teleport]] system based on telephone lines.

These stories proved popular, prompting Mills and O'Neill to develop a regular series, ''Nemesis the Warlock'', which combined the early high-concept science fiction with fantasy in the "sword and sorcery" mould.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grovel.org.uk/nemesis-the-warlock-the-later-heresies/|title = Nemesis the Warlock: The Later Heresies|date = 30 September 2020}}</ref> Torquemada was promoted from chief of the Tube Police to Grand Master of Termight. Nemesis was revealed as a demonic alien with a horned dragon-like head based on the finned nose of his Blitzspear, fighting to protect aliens from Torquemada's genocidal tyranny, although his inhuman attitude and anarchic "Khaos" philosophy gave him an ambiguous morality; for example, in Book Five, "The Vengeance of Thoth", Nemesis is forced to hijack a bus full of children, which he then deliberately crashes, killing all on board as he escapes.

Book Nine concluded in 1989, and the character barely appeared for ten years. Finally, in 1999, Mills and artists [[Henry Flint]] and O'Neill wrapped up the series with Book Ten: The Final Conflict, and an epilogue of sorts, ''Deadlock'', which explored the political state of Termight in the aftermath of Nemesis' and Torquemada's deaths.

==Production==
O'Neill's imaginative, grotesque art helped to establish the popularity of the series, but the efforts he put into creating it led to a low rate of productivity.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} There were a number of delays in the publication of Book One, and a second book was drawn by [[Jesus Redondo]]. This and the higher rates of pay available in America led O'Neill to leave the series prior to Book Four - although a handful of episodes he had drawn just after "Killer Watt" introduced the fourth book.  O'Neill was replaced by [[Bryan Talbot]]. Other artists to draw the series include [[John Hicklenton]], [[David Roach (comic artist)|David Roach]], [[Clint Langley]] and [[Henry Flint]]. O'Neill returned to the strip to illustrate its intended last-ever episode and later for a special anniversary story.

==Characters==
===Warlocks===

[[File:Nemesis_the_Warlock.jpg|thumb|right|Nemesis]]

Warlocks are a [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] species of aliens who are capable of sorcery. Both males and females are horned, fire-breathing and of demonic appearance; females have a [[centaur]]-like quadrupedal morphology while males are bipedal but have unusual combination [[plantigrade]] / [[digitigrade]] leg joints, somewhat resembling [[satyrs]].
; Nemesis the Warlock : The main character and antihero of the series, Nemesis ostensibly fights to free the galaxy from tyranny. Mills decided that with a religious fanatic as the arch-villain, it would be fitting to have a demon as the hero.
; Chira : White Warlock and first wife of Nemesis, mother of his son Thoth. Assassinated by agents of Termight.
; Magna : Black Warlock and second wife of Nemesis. Jealous of Chira, she swallowed Nemesis' [[familiar]] Grobbendonk whole as the first phase of her plan to separate him from his allies, and leaked information to Torquemada that allowed him to locate Chira and Thoth. Killed by Nemesis minutes after their wedding, when her telepathic block failed and he discovered her misdeeds.
; Thoth : Son of Nemesis and Chira. As a hideous [[larva]]-like infant he hypnotizes Sir Hargan, the Terminator who killed his mother, into believing him to be a cute little human baby that he needed to protect. Years later he grows into a powerful rival to Nemesis, as he blames his father for not being there to save his mother.
; Great Uncle Baal : Nemesis' eccentric great uncle and former master of Grobbendonk, banished by Nemesis for his controversial experiments on humans.

===Humans===
; [[Torquemada (comics)|Tomas de Torquemada]]: Primary antagonist of the series, a haughty tyrant and fascist human supremacist who rules the Earth with an iron fist and is hellbent on ridding the universe of all alien life. Through [[Past life regression]] it is shown that he was many people from Earth's history, including [[Matthew Hopkins]], [[John Chivington|Colonel John Chivington]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and the original [[Tomás de Torquemada|Torquemada]] himself.  His motto is "Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave!"
; Purity Brown : Human aide to Nemesis. Her father was taken away and presumably killed when she was only fourteen (as revealed in Book Five; The Vengeance of Thoth) by [[thought police|thought detectors]] for having a dream in which he insulted Torquemada.
; Candida de Torquemada : Wife of Tomas de Torquemada and mother of two of his children, both of whom are among those slain in a bus crash caused by Nemesis. On several occasions, including a major plot arc for book 5, Tomas is shown to genuinely love Candida to the extent he is willing to consort with aliens in an effort to prevent her from leaving him.
; Sister Stern : Insane wife of Tomas de Torquemada and mother of his third child, whom she occasionally considered impure, so tried to commit [[Filicide]], before Tomas ordered her to commit suicide.
; Grand Dragon Mazarin : The leader of Termight after Torquemada's death. A reformer, he ended the persecution of aliens.  After a Terminator [[mutiny]] upon Torquemada's return he was executed by Tomas via torture.
; Nostradamus de Torquemada : Insane brother of Tomas de Torquemada. He was horribly disfigured when Tomas abandoned him during an ambush by the Primords, and was later hidden away in a lunatic asylum to conceal Tomas' disgrace. Nostradamus was originally introduced into the series as Tomas' Grandfather, and not shown to be his brother until Book five.

===Other aliens===
; Grobbendonk : The comical little [[rat]]/[[caterpillar]]-like alien familiar of Nemesis stolen from his Great Uncle Baal. Grobbendonk speaks [[Gibberish]], a Fringe World dialect. Deliberately eaten alive by Magna days before her wedding to Nemesis.

===Robots===
; The [[ABC Warriors]] : Robot mercenaries and allies of Nemesis.

==Stories==

Most of the saga was told in 'books' of between 9 and 20 episodes, with additional stories told in one-offs, which appeared in annuals, specials, or in the weekly comic.
There are a number of collections of the original instalments available, which roughly follow the books as they were originally published. The earlier books were not given individual titles upon their original publication.

a. {{note|cp}} This Prog 2000 was a special edition outside the comic's normal numbering scheme released to mark the year 2000.  Another issue numbered 2000 was published within the comic's normal numbering scheme in 2016.  

The series ''[[ABC Warriors#Deadlock|Deadlock]]'', by [[Pat Mills]] and [[Henry Flint]], was a direct sequel to Nemesis. Prog 2000 (20 September 2016) featured a follow-up Nemesis story (written by Mills and once more drawn by O'Neill) 'Tubular Hells' which reversed the destruction of Nemesis but it has to this point not led to further exploration of the character.

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into a number of [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]], including:

*''The Complete Nemesis the Warlock'':
** ''Volume 1'' (collects "Terror Tube", "Killer Watt", ''Nemesis the Warlock'' Books 1–4, "The Sword Sinister" and "The Secret Life of the Blitzspear", 320 pages, Rebellion, 2007, {{ISBN|1-905437-11-0}})

==In other media==

===Computer games===
''[[Nemesis the Warlock (computer game)|Nemesis the Warlock]]: The Death of Torquemada'' was released as a game made for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. The C64 version of this game was made by [[Martech]] in 1987, programmer [[Michael J. Archer]], musician [[Rob Hubbard]]

===Music video===
The video for [[Shriekback]]'s 1985 single "Nemesis" from the album ''[[Oil & Gold]]'' features Nemesis the Warlock.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bMM61Y5CEU Shriekback - Nemesis], YouTube, retrieved 1 June 2015</ref>

===Toys and games===
[[Wizkids]] / NECA have released three figures of Nemesis the Warlock as part of their Heroclix collectable miniatures game (Rookie, Experienced and Veteran versions). These were only released in the United Kingdom, alongside other 2000AD related figures, as part of the "Indy" expansion to the game. This led to something of an outcry from the American fans of both the game and the character, and this style of "regional" figure-release was not continued in later sets of Heroclix.
