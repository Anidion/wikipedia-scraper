'''''Monte Carlo''''' is a [[gambling]] simulation [[video game]] created for the [[Apple IIgs|Apple II<small>GS</small>]], created by [[PBI Software]]. It was programmed by Richard L. Seaborne and released in 1987.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Description==
''Monte Carlo'' offered a number of traditional [[casino]]-style gambling games, selectable from the game's main screen. Games included: 
*[[Baccarat]]
*[[Blackjack|Black Jack]]
*[[Craps]]
*[[Roulette]]
*[[Slot machine|Slots]]
*[[Trente et Quarante]]
*[[Video Poker]]

One or two players could play against the house using standard casino rules. At the beginning of the game, players are given $5000 in virtual money which they could bet in any amounts by dragging various colored [[casino token|chips]] to the betting areas of the various games. There were no set time limits or goals to the game; players could choose to "[[cash out]]" at any point, at which time the game would be finished and their money total—if large enough to qualify—would be saved on a list of "[[high roller]]s". The player would then have to begin again from the initial $5000 point. If at any point a player bet all his or her money and lost, the game would be over and the player would have to start again; the game did not allow negative balances.

Nowhere in the game was there any explanation or tutorial on how to play any of the games; players were expected to be familiar with the rules of the particular [[casino game]] being played.

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1988 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #133 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon133">{{cite journal
