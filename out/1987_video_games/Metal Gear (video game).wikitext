{{Nihongo foot|'''''Metal Gear'''''|メタルギア|''Metarugia''|||group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is an [[action adventure game|action-adventure]] [[Stealth game|stealth]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Konami]] for the [[MSX2]]. It was released for the system in Japan and parts of Europe in 1987. Considered to have popularized the [[stealth game]] genre, it was the first video game to be fully developed by [[Hideo Kojima]], who would go on to direct most of the games in the [[Metal Gear|''Metal Gear'' series]].<ref>Jeremy Parish, "Metal Gear," ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 225 (January 2008): 93.</ref> A reworked port of the game was released for the [[Famicom]] a few months later, which later saw release in international markets for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] over the following two years; this version was developed without Kojima's involvement and features drastically altered level designs, among other changes.<ref name=gamerstoday /> An [[Video game console emulator|emulated]] Famicom version came with the special edition of ''[[Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes]]'' on [[GameCube]]. A more faithful port of the MSX2 version was later included in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]], as well as in the ''[[Metal Gear Solid HD Collection|HD Edition]]'' of the same game released for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation Vita]], with these newer ports featuring a revised translation and additional gameplay features. The MSX version was also released for [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] and PC.<ref>{{cite web |title=METAL GEAR on GOG.com |url=https://www.gog.com/game/metal_gear |website=GOG.com |access-date=26 September 2020 |archive-date=29 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929084335/https://www.gog.com/game/metal_gear |url-status=live }}</ref> Both the MSX and NES versions of ''Metal Gear'' were re-released as part of the [[Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection|''Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection'']] ''Vol. 1'' compilation for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation 5]], [[Windows]] and [[Xbox Series X/S]].

Players control [[Solid Snake]], an operative of the [[special forces]] unit [[FOXHOUND]], who goes on a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy [[Metal Gear (weapon)|Metal Gear]], a bipedal [[mecha|walking tank]] capable of launching [[nuclear missile]]s from anywhere in the world, as well as rescue a number of fellow agents who have been captured by the enemy. The game was a major international success, with the NES version selling 1{{nbsp}}million units in the United States.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:mgear.png|left|thumb|200px|Solid Snake avoiding a visual encounter with enemy soldiers (MSX2 version)]]
The player controls a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, whose objective is to infiltrate the enemy's base while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the "Alert Mode". In this situation, Snake must escape from the enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:

*If Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen.
*However, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by creating a loud noise through an explosion or an unsuppressed gunshot), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, entering an elevator, or entering a [[boss (video gaming)|boss battle]].

Snake starts his mission unarmed, but can arm himself with numerous firearms and explosives that can be obtained throughout the enemy's stronghold. Each weapon has limited ammunition, these can be replenished by obtaining ammunition caches. A suppressor can be obtained that allows the player to fire the handgun and submachine gun without making a noise. Some weapons can be used to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters.

The enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open with a corresponding key card. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's [[Experience level|rank]] will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player will be demoted to the previous rank.

A transceiver is available for Snake to keep in touch with his commanding officer, [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]], or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake's allies specializes in a specific subject and will usually provide information or advice based on the player's current area, although a reply is not always guaranteed. The player must keep track of each character's frequency number in order to remain in contact with them throughout the game.

The MSX2 version requires the use of a [[tape drive]] (such as the Sony Bitcorder) in order to save and load game progress from checkpoints. A [[Konami Game Master|Game Master II]] cartridge can also be used to enable save states via [[floppy disk]]s at any point. Versions on later platforms eliminated these complicated requirements thanks to standardized storage devices such as memory cards and internal disk drives.

==Plot==
{{Metal Gear chronology}}

===Setting===
''Metal Gear'' takes place in 1995{{snd}}while not defined in the Japanese MSX2 version of the game, which referred to the year as "19XX",<ref name=19xxdate>{{cite book|title=Metal Gear User's Manual|publisher=Konami|language=ja|page=4}}</ref> the release of ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'' established the date within its narrative. The game forms the first entry in an overarching plot concerning the character of Solid Snake, with the origins of the game's plot being later explored in 2015's ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]''.

===Characters===
{{See also|List of characters in the Metal Gear series}}
The player's character is Solid Snake, a rookie member of the special forces group [[FOXHOUND]] sent on his first mission. He is assisted via radio by his commanding officer Big Boss, who offers information about mission objectives and items; as well as a local Resistance movement composed of leader Schneider, a former architect who guides Snake through the layout of the fortress and knows the locations of key items; Diane, a former positive punk vocalist who provides information on the enemy forces from her home; and Jennifer, who infiltrated Outer Heaven's medical staff to find her missing brother and assists Snake as an inside agent. Among the prisoners Snake rescues are [[Gray Fox (Metal Gear)|Grey Fox]] (Gray Fox in the later versions), a FOXHOUND agent who was captured during a previous mission; Dr. Pettrovich (Dr. Drago Pettrovich Madnar in later releases), a robotic engineer who is working for Outer Heaven against his will; and the doctor's daughter, Elen, who was kidnapped by the enemy to coerce her father into developing Metal Gear.

The bosses include Shoot Gunner (renamed Shotmaker in later versions), a former [[Spetsnaz]] agent specializing in the [[riot gun]]; Machinegun Kid, a former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] operative armed with a [[machine gun]]; Fire Trooper, a former [[GSG 9]] operative who uses a [[flamethrower]]; Coward Duck (Dirty Duck in later releases), a [[boomerang]] throwing terrorist who shields himself with hostages; Arnold (Bloody Brad in later releases), two TX-11 class androids designed by Dr. Pettrovich; and the legendary mercenary who founded Outer Heaven, whose true identity is unknown until the end.

===Story===
Near the end of the 20th century, the West discovers that a weapon of mass destruction is being constructed inside Outer Heaven, a fortified state founded by a "legendary mercenary" 200&nbsp;km north of Galzburg, [[South Africa]]. The special forces unit FOXHOUND sends top agent Gray Fox to infiltrate the fortress, assess the situation and neutralize the threat. FOXHOUND loses contact with Gray Fox a few days later, with his last transmission being "METAL GEAR..." To discover what happened to Gray Fox, FOXHOUND commander Big Boss sends his newest recruit, Solid Snake, into the area in an operation codenamed Intrude N313.

Upon insertion into Outer Heaven, Snake makes contact with local resistance members Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer. Using all of his skills and the equipment he procures on site, he manages to rescue Fox. Fox explains that Metal Gear is the codename of a nuclear-equipped bipedal walking tank, which can engage in all forms of combat and launch nuclear weapons from any location. Outer Heaven plans to use Metal Gear to impose itself as the new world superpower.

To destroy Metal Gear and topple the Outer Heaven mercenaries, Snake rescues lead Metal Gear engineer Dr. Pettrovich and his daughter Elen. The scientist explains how Metal Gear can be destroyed, and Snake takes on Outer Heaven's troops. However, he begins to notice that the traps put in his way are too precise and wonders how information on his activities is being tracked. Big Boss begins to act strangely, giving misleading advice that leads Snake into several traps, and eventually ordering him to abort the mission ([[breaking the fourth wall]] by telling the player to turn off the system). Moreover, Schneider is ambushed by hostiles and is presumed dead after losing contact with Snake.

Snake penetrates Outer Heaven's main base and takes out Metal Gear before it reaches completion. As he safely escapes the compound's basement, he is confronted by the mercenary leader of Outer Heaven, who turns out to be Big Boss. The corrupt leader reveals that he had been using his connections to steal military intelligence, establish his own mercenary force, and fund his activities. It was his aim to have Outer Heaven become the world's greatest superpower, able to bring even the West to its knees. He had the rookie Snake sent in, hoping to have him captured and feed misinformation to authorities but had quite obviously underestimated Snake's capabilities.

Having lost Metal Gear and much of his force, Big Boss starts the self-destruct sequence for the compound, and promises he will not die alone; Snake will join him. Snake defeats Big Boss in the last battle and escapes the Outer Heaven compound as it crumbles in flames behind him.{{efn|The 2015 prequel ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' [[Retroactive continuity|reveals]] that the commander Solid Snake defeats in ''Metal Gear'' is not the original Big Boss but his body double, [[Venom Snake]].}} After the end credits, a message from Big Boss is displayed saying that he will meet Solid Snake again.

==Development==
Director [[Hideo Kojima]] was asked to take over a project from a senior associate. ''Metal Gear'' was intended to be an action game that featured modern military combat. However, the MSX2's hardware limited the number of on-screen bullets and enemies, which Kojima felt impeded the combat aspect.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://8bitdigi.com/metal-gear-at-30/|title=The Legacy of Metal Gear, 30 Years Later|author=Rezaee, Stan|date=12 July 2017|publisher=8Bit/Digi|access-date=13 July 2017|archive-date=12 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112021333/https://8bitdigi.com/metal-gear-at-30/|url-status=live}}</ref> The MSX2 also had limited [[scrolling]] capabilities, which made it difficult to produce a smooth [[scrolling shooter]], like Konami's arcade hit ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' (1981).<ref name="gamasutra">{{cite news |last1=Low |first1=David |title=GO3: Kojima Talks Metal Gear History, Future |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/104303/GO3_Kojima_Talks_Metal_Gear_History_Future.php |access-date=20 June 2021 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |date=April 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513071950/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/104303/GO3_Kojima_Talks_Metal_Gear_History_Future.php |archive-date=2012-05-13}}</ref> Inspired by ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', Kojima reversed the focus of the gameplay from shooting down the enemy to avoiding capture.<ref name="RG-35">{{cite journal|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|title=Before They Were Famous|issue=35|page=74|first=John|last=Szczepaniak}}</ref> The game design was no longer about shooting but about "trying to form the tension of [[hide and seek]]" according to Kojima, subverting the [[shoot 'em up]] genre popular at the time. Kojima designed the game so that, when Snake is discovered, the gameplay changed to become a [[puzzle video game]] "like ''[[Pac-Man]]''" (1980) where the enemy guards behave like ''Pac-Man'' ghosts that Snake needs to avoid.<ref name="gamasutra"/>

The game was titled ''Intruder'' during the early planning stages.<ref name=mg1document>{{cite web |last1=Gantayat |first1=Anoop |title=Before There Was Metal Gear, There Was "Intruder" |url=https://andriasang.com/comtgu/kojima_shelf/ |website=Andriasang |access-date=20 June 2021 |date=2012-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916060322/https://andriasang.com/comtgu/kojima_shelf/ |archive-date=2012-09-16}}</ref>  The packaging illustration used for the retail releases of the game, which depicts the protagonist Solid Snake holding a gun, was traced over a [[publicity still]] of [[Michael Biehn]] posing as his character [[Kyle Reese]] from the 1984 film ''[[The Terminator]]''.<ref name=terminator1>{{cite web|title=25 Stolen Images in Video Games|url=http://arcadesushi.com/stolen-images-in-video-games/|date=2016-03-08|access-date=2017-04-11|first=Jon|last=Ledford|website=Arcade Sushi|publisher=[[Townsquare Media]]|archive-date=2021-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210729134148/https://arcadesushi.com/stolen-images-in-video-games/|url-status=live}}</ref> Kojima, who was still newly employed at Konami at the time, had no involvement with the production of this illustration.<ref name=kojimaonmg1cover>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/kojima_hideo/status/437060441575927808|title=小島秀夫 on Twitter: "MG1の時は新人でパッケージには全く関与出来ず不本意なものになったが、「スナッチャー」では開田裕次さんにMG2では高荷義之さんにMGSでは生頼範義さんにメインビジュアルやポスターをお願いできた。当時はゲーム自体のビジュアルが陳腐だったのでイラストでのメインビジュアルは重要だった。"|language=ja|access-date=2015-11-04|archive-date=2016-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305135138/https://twitter.com/kojima_hideo/status/437060441575927808|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Releases==
===MSX2===
''Metal Gear'' was originally released on the [[MSX|MSX2]] home computer in Japan on July 13, 1987, with an English version released in Europe during the same year. Due to memory constraints, the Japanese version was written entirely in [[katakana]] (with character names presented in [[Roman letters]]), while the English version is written entirely in uppercase, has numerous instances of [[Engrish|erroneous grammar and misspellings]], and features fewer radio calls than the Japanese version (with 56% of the calls kept) and shortened messages.<ref name=mg1document/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nekurahoka/|title=Nekura_Hoka's Metal Gear Code Site|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027023857/http://geocities.com/nekurahoka/|archive-date=2009-10-27}}</ref>

On August 18, 2004, Konami released a port of the MSX2 ''Metal Gear'' for feature phones through their Konami Net DX service in Japan as a promotional tie-in for ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater]]''. This updated port served as the basis for the version included on the second disc of ''Subsistence'' (the expanded edition of ''Metal Gear Solid 3'') for the PlayStation 2 released in 2005, and later in the ''HD Edition'' released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011 and for PlayStation Vita in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/118/1187604p1.html|title=The Metal Gear Solid HD Collection Explained|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125165713/http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/12/the-metal-gear-solid-hd-collection-explained|archive-date=2015-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.konamimobile.com/gamedetail.aspx?rkw=mgc |title=KONAMI MOBILE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223044033/http://konamimobile.com/gamedetail.aspx?rkw=mgc |archive-date=2009-02-23 }}</ref> In 2020, a standalone version of the port was released on PC through the storefront [[GOG.com]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-09-25 |title=Classic KONAMI games return to modern computers on GOG.COM |url=https://www.gog.com/news/classic_konami_games_return_to_modern_computers_on_gogcom |access-date=2024-03-30 |website=GOG.com |language=en-US |archive-date=2024-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240330193319/https://www.gog.com/news/classic_konami_games_return_to_modern_computers_on_gogcom |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Famicom / NES===
[[Image:NES ME USA screenshot.png|thumb|right|The level designs were altered for the NES version, which includes an extensive outdoor sequence prior to reaching the first building.]]
A port of ''Metal Gear'' for the Family Computer (or Famicom) was released in Japan on December 22, 1987. This was followed by an English localization for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (or NES) released in North America in June 1988 (published by Konami's [[Ultra Games]] division) and in [[PAL region|Europe and Australia]] sometime in 1989. This was the first version of ''Metal Gear'' that was released in North America, since the MSX2 platform was never released in that market.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Metal Gear Solid |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=40|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1998|pages=54-55}}</ref>

According to Kojima, the port was developed by another Konami division at Tokyo which was given the [[source code]] from the MSX2 version without the consent of the original team. Many changes were made during the porting process that later led to this version being publicly disowned by Kojima years after its release.<ref name=gamerstoday>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerstoday.com/world_tour/kojima/index.html |title=Hideo Kojima: Game Guru, Movie Maniac |author=Steven Kent |quote='''HK:''' I really don't like saying this, but it really wasn't up to my standards. The care that I put in the original wasn't there. It [the Famicom version] was a more difficult game. In the very beginning, when you go from the entrance into the fortress, for example, there are dogs there. In the Famicom version, the dogs just come after you and you get killed. It was too difficult to get into the fortress. The fun stealth element was not there, and the actual Metal Gear, the robot, doesn't appear in the game. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927033904/http://www.gamerstoday.com/world_tour/kojima/index.html |archive-date=2007-09-27 }}</ref><ref name=metalgearfccomment>{{cite web|url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/mgs_tts/japanese/limited_0206.html|author=Konami Computer Entertainment Japan website staff|title=Editorial about the Famicom version of Metal Gear|language=ja|access-date=2010-01-09|archive-date=2012-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022122700/http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/mgs_tts/japanese/limited_0206.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=mgdiff>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/881/881710p1.html|title=Have You Really Played Metal Gear?|author=Buchanan, Levi|date=2008-06-13|publisher=[[IGN]]|access-date=March 31, 2009|archive-date=2012-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624170124/http://retro.ign.com/articles/881/881710p1.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|title=Metal Gear Saga Vol. 1|publisher=Konami|date=2005}}</ref> Masahiro Ueno, who worked as a programmer for the NES version, has stated that the staff who worked on the port were given a three-month deadline and were ordered to make the port as different as possible from the MSX2 version.

Another big change made to the game was in the level designs. Instead of the underwater infiltration from the MSX2 version, the NES version starts the game with Solid Snake parachuting into the middle of a jungle alongside three other soldiers (who are never seen nor mentioned after the intro). After landing in the jungle, the player must reach a transport truck at the end that will take Snake to the entrance of the first building. The player can use other transport trucks to reach the entrances of the other buildings quicker, since they travel in a cyclical pattern. The basement floors of Building 1 and 2 in the MSX2 version were made into separate buildings, Building 4 and 5 respectively, which are only reachable by going through one of two jungle mazes located in the outdoor areas between the other three buildings. The correct path to take in the jungle maze is never revealed in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587449-metal-gear/faqs/38049|title=NES Metal Gear script FAQ|author=Browning, Robert|publisher=GameFAQs|access-date=2014-09-04|archive-date=2014-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904235414/http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587449-metal-gear/faqs/38049|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to the removal of the Metal Gear tank, the Hind D boss on the rooftop of Building 1 was replaced by a pair of armed turret gunners called "Twin Shot".<ref name=gamerstoday /><ref name=mgdiff/> The NES version lacks the higher alert phase from the MSX2 version and the [[jet pack|jetpack]]-wearing soldiers on the rooftops of Building 1 and 2 lost their ability to fly (making them act more like regular guards). On the other hand, enemies no longer drop ammo nor rations when punched to death. Much like the MSX2 version, the English localization of the NES versions contains numerous instances of erroneous grammar, such as "Contact missing our Grey Fox",<ref>{{cite video game|title=Metal Gear|developer=Konami|platform=NES|level=The first radio transmission with Big Boss at the start of the mission.}}</ref> "Uh-Oh! The truck have started to move!",<ref>{{cite video game|title=Metal Gear|developer=Konami|platform=NES|level=Whenever Snake enters a moving truck.}}</ref> and "I feel asleep!!"<ref>{{cite video game|title=Metal Gear|developer=Konami|platform=NES|level=Whenever an enemy soldier wakes up from his sleep.}}</ref>

[[Password (video gaming)|Passcodes]] are used in this version to save progress. When Snake is killed by the enemy or loses his life by certain other means, the player is given a choice to continue the game from the last checkpoint or quit and resume later with the given passcode. The passcode keeps track of Snake's rank (which determines his checkpoint in this version), inventory, hostages rescued, bosses defeated and certain event flags.<ref name=mg1nes_passcode>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougbabcock.com/metal-gear.php|title=Metal Gear Password Generator|author=Babcock, Doug|access-date=2016-07-09|archive-date=2016-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724075930/http://www.dougbabcock.com/metal-gear.php|url-status=live}}</ref> One particular passcode featured in the Japanese and North American version, in which the player types the expletive "fuck me" and fills the remaining spaces with "1", will transport the player to the final battle with no equipment. This resulted in the passcode system being altered for the European versions of the game, with all of the vowels being removed.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

''[[The Games Machine]]'' gave a positive review of the MSX version, giving the game a 79% score. They stated that the "initial impression of disdain at this non too-impressively animated macho man may rapidly change on delving deeper." They praised the graphics and the size of the game area, underlining the fact that it ensured "the action and suspense never wanes". They also wrote that the game was rapidly addictive, and that "the urge to get further into the game is quite strong". They concluded positively on the quality of the game, saying that if "this standard of Konami software is maintained then maybe more people will think hard about joining the other 200,000 MSX owners". They noted that there was no information regarding the game's Japanese author at the time, but stated that "whoever they may be they certainly seem to know their business."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Metal Gear (Konami) |journal=[[The Games Machine]] |date=November 1987 |issue=2 (December 1987) |page=61 |url=https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/the-games-machine/2/0/1987/12/0#60 |access-date=2021-04-09 |archive-date=2022-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221203065729/https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/the-games-machine/2/0/1987/12/0#60 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Legacy==
{{Further|Metal Gear}}

Its success led to the creation of two separately produced [[sequel]]s; the first one, ''[[Snake's Revenge]]'', was produced specifically for the NES in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]] and the other, ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]'', was the sequel developed by Hideo Kojima and released in Japan for the MSX2 during the same year as a response to the former's creation. The latter was followed by ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in [[1998 in video gaming|1998]], which was in turn followed by numerous sequels and spinoffs in ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series.

The intro theme ("Operation Intrude N313"), main theme ("Theme of Tara") and game over theme ("Just Another Dead Soldier") from the MSX2 version were reused for the VR Training theme in ''Metal Gear Solid'', which in turn was reused in ''[[Metal Gear: Ghost Babel]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty#Substance|Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance]]''. "Theme of Tara" is one of the tunes that can be heard in the "Shadow Moses Island" stage in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' for the [[Wii]], the music for the beginning section of the Battleship Halberd Interior stage of the Adventure mode, where Snake officially enters the storyline, and can also be selected as music with an [[iPod]] item in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]''.

In 1988, Konami published a [[gamebook]] adaptation of ''Metal Gear'' in Japan as the second installment in their Konami Gamebook Series. The gamebook is set two years after the events of the game, in which Solid Snake is called back into action after FOXHOUND receives intelligence on a terrorist group who have obtained the plans for Metal Gear and are now mass-producing the mech. The book portrays Solid Snake as an unsuccessful illustrator in his personal life outside his job as a FOXHOUND agent.<ref name=gamebook>{{cite book|title=Metal Gear|series=Konami Gamebook Series|language=ja|date=March 31, 1988|isbn=4-87655-013-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcatplus-equal.nii.ac.jp/libportal/DocDetail?txt_docid=jBKID%3AB8806348|title=ISBN 4-87655-013-1 on Webcat Plus|language=ja|access-date=March 30, 2009}}</ref>

In 1990, a novelization of ''Metal Gear'' was published in the U.S. by [[Scholastic Books]] as part of their ''[[Worlds of Power]]'' series of novelizations based on third-party NES games. The ''Metal Gear'' book was written by Alexander Frost under the pen name F.X. Nine, the same pen name used for all the authors in the Worlds of Power series.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Alexander|title=Metal Gear|date=July 1990|publisher=Scholastic Books|isbn=0-590-43777-1}}</ref>  This book adheres much more closely to the localized version of the backstory as presented in the North American packaging and manual, as opposed to the actual in-game plot which was not changed to reflect this difference. Big Boss is not featured in the book, but instead, two different characters, Commander South and Colonel Vermon CaTaffy, serve as Solid Snake's commanding officer and Outer Heaven's leader respectively. The book also gives Solid Snake the identity of Justin Halley and changes the name of his organization from FOX HOUND to the Snake Men. Because the book was targeted at young kids, the cover illustration was altered, with Snake's handgun being airbrushed out.

==Remake attempts==

===Official===
During a public Q&A event conducted at London with [[Geoff Keighley]] on March 13, 2014, series' creator Hideo Kojima expressed interest in developing remakes of the MSX2 ''Metal Gear'' games in order to reconcile plot discrepancies that have since been introduced into the series, but had no plans at the time due to the ongoing development of ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' (itself a prequel set before the events of the original ''Metal Gear'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owxT2sAOJQw|title=HIDEO KOJIMA interview with host Geoff Keighley - 13 March 2014
