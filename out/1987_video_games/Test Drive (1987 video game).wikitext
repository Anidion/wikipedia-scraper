The player chooses one of five supercars ([[Lamborghini Countach]], [[Lotus Esprit Turbo]], [[Chevrolet Corvette (C4)|Chevrolet Corvette C4]], [[Porsche 930|Porsche 911 Turbo]] (930), or [[Ferrari Testarossa]]) to drive on a winding cliffside two-lane road while avoiding traffic and outrunning police speed traps. The course's five stages are separated by gas station pit stops.<ref>''Test Drive'' manual</ref>

==Release==
In 1987, Accolade published ''Test Drive'' as a computer game worldwide, and Electronic Arts imported it to the United Kingdom. The quality of the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and DOS ports differ from each other.<ref name="tucker198802"/><ref name="cvg76td">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-076/CVG_076_Feb_1988#page/n45/mode/1up/|title = CVG Magazine Issue 076|date = February 1988}}</ref> The Amiga version's detailed visuals and audio realistically depicted the game's racing theme,<ref name="tucker198802"/> while its Atari ST counterpart used simplified graphics and sound effects. The Commodore 64 and DOS ports were of similar quality to the Amiga version. The gameplay was kept intact for all platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/thegamesmachine-magazine-04/TheGamesMachine_04#page/n57/mode/|title = The Games Machine Magazine Issue 04}}</ref>

==Reception and legacy==
''Test Drive'' was a commercial hit. In late 1989, ''[[Video Games & Computer Entertainment]]'' reported that the game's sales had surpassed 400,000 units and were well on their way to the half-million mark.<ref name=megahits>{{cite journal | author=Worley, Joyce | title=Mega Hits: The Best of the Best | journal=[[Video Games & Computer Entertainment]] | date=December 1989 | pages=130–132, 137, 138 }}</ref>

It received generally positive reviews from video game critics. ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in 1987 that ''Test Drive'' "offers outstanding graphics and the potential to 'hook' every ''[[Pole Position (video game)|Pole Position]]'' fan".<ref name="cgw198711">{{cite magazine | title=Christmas Buyers Guide | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=November 1987 | pages=20 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_41/page/n19/mode/2up |issue=41}}</ref> David M. Wilson reviewed the game for the magazine in 1988, stating that "there may be more competitive racing games on the market, but this game combines the enjoyment of driving five of the most exotic sportscars in the world with outrunning 'Smokies' on mountain highways. What more could a race car junkie (or arcade fan) ask for?!"<ref name="CGW44">{{cite magazine |last=Wilson |first=David M. |title=Life in the Fast Lane: Accolade's "TestDrive" |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=February 1988 |volume=1 |issue=44 |pages=44}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' praised the excellent graphics and sound, but noted that the game only had one course.<ref name="tucker198802">{{cite magazine|last=Tucker|first=Troy|date=February 1988|title=''Test Drive''|url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-02-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_093_1988_Feb#page/n51/mode/2up|magazine=[[Compute!]]|pages=50|accessdate=10 November 2013}}</ref> The game was reviewed in 1988 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column.
