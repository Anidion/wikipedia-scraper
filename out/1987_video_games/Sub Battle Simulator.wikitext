==Description==
''Sub Battle Simulator'' sets the action in times of World War 2, with the player on the American or German side. There are 36 German missions and 24 American missions in which the player can command six different submarines. The player is responsible for navigation, using five different levels of mapping, attacks' planning based on weather and surroundings as well as paying attention to the radar. The game gives the possibility to play underwater or on the surface. A player can choose target practice, individual missions or war commands as either a German or an American submarine Captain.

==Reception==
Game reviewers Hartley and Pattie Lesser complimented the game in their "The Role of Computers" column in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #122 (1987), calling it "the finest of the submarine simulation games" and stating "This is a real winner for wargaming enthusiasts!"<ref name="Dragon122">{{cite journal

As a simulation, it falls far from reality". The review as examples of its flaws being able to see Iceland with binoculars from 500 miles away; sinking an aircraft carrier with a deck gun; and multiple bugs.<ref name="carey198707">{{cite news | title=Sub Battle Simulator | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June–July 1987 | accessdate=2 November 2013 | author=Carey, Regan | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1987&pub=2&id=38 | pages=14}}</ref> 1991 and 1993 surveys of strategy and war games gave it three stars out of five.<ref name="brooks199112">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=89 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: The 1900-1950 Epoch / Part II (M-Z) of an Annotated Paiktography | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
