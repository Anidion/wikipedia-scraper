'''''Rescue''''' is a computer game published by [[Mastertronic]] in 1987 for the [[ZX Spectrum]].  It was written by Ste Cork with music by Tiny Williams and graphics by Mark O'Neill.<ref name='rgrescue' />

==Gameplay==

The purpose of the game is to rescue the correct scientist and the "ultimate experiment".  The player must then guide the scientists back to their spacecraft and refuel it before escaping.

The game generates the same maze layout each time it is played, however it randomises which scientist and which secret experiment (represented by a red test tube) is the correct one.

Enemies are spawned randomly and go around destroying the scientists, experiments, fuel and ammo caches, sometimes making it to your spaceship and destroying items you had already recovered.

==Reception==
In a 1987 review, ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' described the game as "nice graphics, easy to play but impossible to complete!" and awarded it 7 out of 10.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Worrall |first=Tony |date=January 1988 |title=Stocking Fillers |url=https://archive.org/details/your-sinclair-25/page/n45/mode/2up |magazine=[[Your Sinclair]] |location=United Kingdom |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] |issue=25 |pages=45–46 |access-date=}}</ref>

''Rescue'' was placed at number 44 in the ''Your Sinclair'' Official Top 100, compiled by videogame journalist [[Rev. Stuart Campbell|Stuart Campbell]] in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |title=THE YS TOP 100 SPECCY GAMES OF ALL TIME (EVER!) |url=http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/world/ys/top100.htm |access-date=25 June 2021}}</ref>
