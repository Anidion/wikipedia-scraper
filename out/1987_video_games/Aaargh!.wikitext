'''''Aaargh!''''' is a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] action [[video game]] in which the player controls a giant [[monster]] with the goal of obtaining eggs by destroying buildings in different cities across a lost island. It was designed for [[Mastertronic]]'s [[Arcadia Systems]], an [[arcade cabinet|arcade machine]] based on the custom hardware of the [[Amiga]], and was released in 1987. It was [[porting|ported]] to a range of other platforms and released on these across 1988 and 1989. [[Electronic Arts]] distributed the Amiga version of the game.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Aaargh!_Arcade_Gameplay_Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Taking the role of a monster, the player must destroy buildings in search of eggs.]]
The goal of the game is to find the golden dragon's egg. The player controls one of two monsters who must destroy buildings in order to find [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]] eggs, the discovery of each of which triggers a fight with a rival monster. When five eggs are found, the two monsters fight on a volcano to claim the dragon's egg.

The game is an action game with [[fighting game]] elements. The player chooses to play as either a dragon-like [[lizard]] or an [[ogre]] (depicted as a [[cyclops]] in the game); the character that the player does not select becomes the player's rival to obtain the egg. In the arcade version of the game either one or two players could play simultaneously, whereas on the ports only one player could play at a time.

Gameplay takes place across the ten cities of the Lost Island, each representing a different era of civilisation (such as [[ancient Egypt]] and the [[American frontier|Wild West]]) and each comprising one [[Level (video gaming)|level]] of the game. Each city is represented by a single static playing area that uses a form of [[2.5D|2.5D projection]] in order to give the impression of depth on the screen.

The game received mixed reviews from gaming magazines across the platforms to which it was ported, with scores ranging from around 2/10<ref name=ACE /> (or equivalent) up to almost 9/10.<ref name=zzap />

While reviewers praised the [[Video game graphics|graphics]] and sound, particularly on the Amiga port, they criticised the gameplay. ''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]'' magazine said that although the game had "good graphics, atmospheric sound and good gameplay" there was not enough challenge to the game and that players would "not want to spend much time playing a game you know you can beat easily."<ref name=ACE /> ZX Spectrum reviewers were unimpressed by the fact that the game required levels to be loaded individually, with ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' magazine describing it as a "multi-level, multi-load, beat 'em, blowtorch 'em up which'll have you screaming its title each time you die and have to reload."<ref name=sinclairuser /><ref name=yoursinclair />

The game was reviewed in 1989 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #141 by Patricia Hartley and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers normally assign a rating to a game ranging from 1 up to 5 stars, but they disliked this game so much that they ranked it with an "X" instead.<ref name=dragon141>{{cite magazine |title=The Role of Computers |last1=Hartley|first1=Patricia| last2=Lesser |first2=Kirk |magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] |issue=141 |date=1989 |page=72|publisher=TSR Inc|url=https://archive.org/stream/DragonMagazine260_201801/DragonMagazine141#page/n73/mode/2up}}</ref>
