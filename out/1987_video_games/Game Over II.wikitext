'''''Game Over II''''' (known as '''''Phantis''''' in Spain) is a combination [[scrolling shooter]] and [[platform game]] developed and published by [[Dinamic Software]] in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[MSX]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Atari ST]].

==Gameplay==
''Game Over II'' is a mix between a [[scrolling shooter]] (similar to ''[[R-Type]]'') and a [[platform game]] (similar to ''[[Turrican]]''). There are four "phases" with six levels each. Some versions of the game were split into two parts due to size restrictions.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Plot==
In the original Spanish version (''Phantis''), the player controls Commander Serena on a mission to rescue her expedition partner captured on Moon 4 of the SOTPOK System, better known as the world of Phantis. The English-language version (''Game Over II'') takes place immediately after the events of ''Game Over'', where Arkos, the hero of the rebellion, is nowhere to be found. After it has been discovered that he has been imprisoned on the jail planet Phantis by the heirs of the empress Gremla, Major Locke is chosen for the rescue mission. Other than the graphical change of a female player character to a male player character, the game itself is largely identical in both versions.

==Release==
Although originally released as an independent game under the title ''Phantis'', it was retitled as a sequel to ''[[Game Over (video game)|Game Over]]''. The Atari ST version was never published in Spain and only exists with the ''Game Over II'' title. The game's promotion included an appearance of a model dressed up as Queen Gremla at the trade convention PC Show '88.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/MSXClub/MSX%20Club%2046#page/n5/mode/2up/|title=MSX Club|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/microhobby-magazine-179.pdf|title=MicroHobby Magazine Issue 179|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
