== Gameplay ==
The game opens with Maxie (voiced by Raquel Shapira<ref name=":0" />) fully clothed and introducing herself as the player's date. The player can click on the 'Yes' button to gradually remove her clothes. Maxie will fish for compliments, and if the player selects no, Maxie will get insulted and close the program on the player.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=2016-09-22 |title=Long Before Internet Porn, There Was 'MacPlaymate' |url=https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/long-before-internet-porn-there-was-macplaymate |access-date=2023-04-29 |website=MEL Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> Once fully nude, she offers the player to open her toy box. This brings the player to a new interface where they can interact with Maxie and view short animations with voice acting.

The Toy box includes a [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]], the [[Dildo|Mighty Me Throbber]], the Deep Plunger, the [[Anal sex|Anal Explorer]], [[Personal lubricant|Lusty Lube]], and disembodied Helping Hands. In the tabs, under 'Watch Me' the player can choose 6 different masturbation animations for the sprite to do. Under costumes, the player can have Maxie wear stockings, a corset, gloves & spike heels outfit, a [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] ensemble, a full fetish ensemble, or fully nude. The player can also add a sex partner to the scene, either a female partner named Lola, nude or in a fetish ensemble, or a male partner named Melvin, a tiny man with an 8-ball for a head.

The game features a panic button that when clicked on will cover the computer screen with a fake [[spreadsheet]]. The player can also choose to print out Maxie's current pose as a pinup.

== Development and release ==
The game's origins come from Mike Saenz experimenting with the [[MacroMind]]’s [[Adobe Director|Videoworks Interactive]] and wondering, with the limitations currently on digital animation, what kind of game could be built that was repetitive but still held people's interest.<ref name=":1" /> He concluded interactive erotica was the solution, inspired by the issues of [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]] he read as a kid and cheap novelty sex toys.<ref name=":1" /> He then spent the 2 weeks in 1986 programming the game.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2014-09-27 |title=MacPlaymate – Nostalgia Central |url=https://nostalgiacentral.com/pop-culture/toys-games/macplaymate/ |access-date=2023-04-29 |website=nostalgiacentral.com |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Frank Brooks, a Connecticut banker, expressed interest in the game and wanted to sell it as a commercial product. He assisted Saenz in cleaning up the code and packaging the product. In January 1987, the game debuted at [[Macworld/iWorld|Macworld]], selling for $50.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

== Reception ==
The game was widely popular at the 1987 Macworld show, selling out on the first day and earning a total of $60,000.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> 

[[MacroMind]] openly condemned the game, the spokesperson calling it "a form of exploitation", and requested the developer that some of the profits for the game sold be donated to the Chicago Abused Women Coalition.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last=Morrison |first=Patt |date=1988-11-28 |title=MACPLAYMATE: IS IT SOFTWARE OR HARD PORN? – Orlando Sentinel |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1988-11-28-0080380284-story.html |access-date=2023-04-29 |website=www.orlandosentinel.com}}</ref> 

The game was popular among male office workers of the time, who saw the program as an amusing novelty. The software tended to be viewed at work, which brought on criticisms from female employees, who saw the software as a modern iteration of the [[Pinup|office pinup poster]] and a form of [[sexual harassment]].<ref name=":3" />

== Playboy cease and desist ==
''Playboy'' sent a cease-and-desist letter to the publisher PEGASUS Productions over the use of the word 'Playmate' in the marketing. The publisher removed the 'e' from the physical material, calling the name MacPlaymat. This change was only for the physical packaging, and the software still displayed the original title.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" />

In February 1989 ''Playboy'' sued Frank Brooks and PEGASUS Productions for using their company's trademark in the game. ''Playboy'' claimed the game hurt their image as buyers may think it was originated or sponsored by the Playboy company, which also marketed videos, clothing, toys and other products under the ‘Playmate’ trademark <ref>{{Cite web |last=FECTEAU |first=LOIS |date=1989-02-09 |title=Playboy sues over sexy computer game - UPI Archives |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/02/09/Playboy-sues-over-sexy-computer-game/6887603003600/ |access-date=2023-04-29 |website=UPI |language=en}}</ref>

Brooks and ''Playboy'' settled out of court in an undisclosed agreement.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

== Legacy ==
Frank Brooks stated that ''MacPlaymate'' was one of the most [[pirated]] programs for the MacIntosh.<ref name=":3" />

In April 1990, Saenz turned ''MacPlaymate'' into a color version on CD-ROM called [[Virtual Valerie]] under his new company, [[Reactor Inc]].<ref name=":1" />
