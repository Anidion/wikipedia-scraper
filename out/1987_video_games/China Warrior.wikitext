'''''China Warrior''''', known as {{nihongo foot|'''''The Kung Fu'''''|ザ・クンフー|Za Kunfū|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (THE 功夫) in [[Japan]], is a [[beat 'em up]] video game created in 1987 by [[Hudson Soft]] for the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-kung-fu-china-warrior/|title = The Kung Fu (China Warrior) &#124; Retro Gamer| date=11 February 2009}}</ref> The game received mixed reviews upon release, with praise for its large [[sprite (graphics)|sprite graphics]] but criticism towards its gameplay.

The game was ported to [[mobile phone]]s and the Hudson Channel for the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] exclusively in Japan with redone graphics, audio, and gameplay. The PC Engine version was also released for the [[Wii]]'s, [[Nintendo 3DS]]'s, and [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] and on the Japanese [[PlayStation Store]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/yD6YWUyG2CjHo9-ekH3T63HoifNIi0wK|title = Nintendo - Official Site - Video Game Consoles, Games - Nintendo - Official Site}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/50010000019075|title=The 功夫 &#124; ニンテンドー3Ds &#124; 任天堂}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/china-warrior-wii-u|title=China Warrior for Wii U - Nintendo Game Details}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=THE 功夫|url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/jp0555npjj30018_00thekunfu0000jh19.html|work=PlayStation.com (Japan)|publisher=Sony|date=2010-01-20|accessdate=2010-01-20|archive-date=2010-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123205302/http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/jp0555npjj30018_00thekunfu0000jh19.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Story==
A [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese]] [[martial artist]] named {{nihongo|Wang|王（ワン）}}, whose style resembles that of [[Bruce Lee]], embarks on a mission to bring down opposing enemies and the Dark Emperor, who stands atop the castle {{nihongo|Luo Yang Ge|洛陽閣（ルーヤンカク）}} in [[China]].

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to walk through each stage while throwing punches and kicks at enemies and objects, which also can be done in midair. There are four levels which are broken down into three stages each, for a total of twelve stages. When Wang gets knocked out, the game starts over at the beginning of the stage in which he got knocked out. Players can memorize the object/enemy pattern in order to get through the stage more easily whenever Wang gets knocked out. At the end of each level, there is a boss fight.

The gameplay and controls are similar to [[Irem]]'s arcade game ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' (1984), with gameplay also similar to [[Taito]]'s ''[[Gladiator (arcade game)|Gladiator]]'' (1986) without the sword or shield held in hand.<ref name="HG101"/> The graphics utilized very large character models that fill up the screen. They were capable of moving without any graphical flickering.

==Reception==
In 1987, the character size and detail was a positive selling point for the title in Japan.<ref name="http://wii.ign.com/articles/800/800480p1.html">{{Cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/800/800480p1.html |title=Wii game |access-date=2009-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527031121/http://wii.ign.com/articles/800/800480p1.html |archive-date=2009-05-27 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The release would not reach US until two years later. By then, the title faced much tougher competition against games like ''[[Last Battle (video game)|Last Battle]]'' and ''[[Altered Beast]]''.

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reviewed ''Drunken Master'' for the PC Engine, giving it a 58% score. They praised the "giant-sized sprites" as "very impressive on this horizontally scrolling kung-fu game" but said "only three moves result in the game becoming ultimately dull".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Complete Games Guide |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' scored ''China Warrior'' 18 out of 40, criticizing the simple gameplay and [[Bruceploitation]] but with some praise for the large character sprites.<ref name="EGM">{{cite magazine|date=December 1989|title= China Warrior|url=https://archive.org/details/ElectronicGamingMonthly_201902/Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly%20Issue%20005%20%28December%201989%29/page/n56|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=5 (The 1990 Video Game Buyer's Guide)|page=57}}</ref>

Upon release on the [[Wii Virtual Console]] in 2007, ''[[IGN]]'' denounced the game for its overly limiting gameplay, forcing the player to constantly move right.<ref name="http://wii.ign.com/articles/800/800480p1.html"/> In addition, while the graphical advancements of the game were prominent, many felt that they were not substantial enough to pardon the game's critical flaws. In the game's review for [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]], ''IGN'' and ''[[GameSpot]]'' gave the game an abysmal review, citing bad graphics and repetitive gameplay, among other things.<ref name="http://wii.ign.com/articles/800/800480p1.html"/><ref name="http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/chinawarrior/review.html"> [http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/chinawarrior/review.html http://gamespot.com/]</ref> The game was also featured in [[1UP.com|1UP]]'s "Broken Pixels", a show dedicated to mocking bad video games.<ref name="www.gamevideos.1up.com">{{Cite web |url=http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/16930 |title=www.gamevideos.1up.com |access-date=2009-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707061934/http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/16930 |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="HG101"/> Michael Plasket of ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' said it is "probably best treated as little more than a tech demo for the potential of the TurboGrafx-16 instead of a legitimately entertaining game".<ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Plasket |first1=Michael |title=China Warrior |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/china-warrior/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=September 27, 2017 |access-date=15 June 2021}}</ref>
