'''''Oriental Hero''''' is a ninja-themed [[side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up|beat-'em-up]] video game published in 1987 exclusively for the [[ZX Spectrum]] under the [[Firebird Software]] Silver Range label. It was developed by Tron Software as the sequel to their 1986 multi-platform release, ''[[Ninja Master]]''.

==Gameplay and plot==

''Oriental Hero'' centers on the ninja protagonist, who after achieving victory in the previous game ''[[Ninja Master]]'' travels on the road leading to the palace of Zerwin the Wizard, who the protagonist must eventually defeat in order to win the title of Supreme Oriental Combat Master.<ref name=crash />

The game comprises four levels, each a horizontally scrolling platform on which the player-ninja must fight several ground and flying enemies and projectiles before reaching the [[Boss (video games)|boss]] at the end of the level.<ref name=crash /> The player-ninja can defend himself by jumping or ducking;<ref name=crash /> his only fighting moves are punching, kicking, and [[Flying kick|flying-kicking]].<ref name=yoursinclair /> The projectiles appear rapidly and can kill the player with one hit but can themselves be killed with one hit. The ground enemies on the other hand take between one and three hits to kill. The bosses at the end of each level—the Terrible Indian Cobra, the Highly Technical Triple Armed War Unit, Ivan Dragovich the Russian Master, and Zerwin the Wizard<ref name=crash />—can be killed with three hits.<ref name=sinclairuser />

==Development==
Michel Nass and Tommy Gardh of Tron Software, a Swedish video game development company,<ref name=nm>{{cite book | author=Tron Swedish Software | date=1986 | url= | title=Ninja Master | publisher=Firebird Software | at=Copyright screen}}</ref> began working on ''Oriental Hero'' in late 1986, shortly after the release of ''[[Ninja Master]]'', its predecessor. Nass was responsible for coding the game while Gardh produced the graphics and sound.<ref name=oh>{{cite book | last=Nass | first=Michel | author2=Tommy Gardh | date=1987 | url= | title=Oriental Hero | publisher=Firebird Software | at=Copyright screen}}</ref>

''Oriental Hero'' was published in July 1987 by [[Firebird Software]] on their Silver Range budget label.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Staff writer | date=31 July 1987 | url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2969&page=45 | pages=41, 43, 45 | title=New Releases | journal=Popular Computing Weekly | publisher=Sunshine Publications | volume=6 | number=30 | via=Spectrum Computing}}</ref> It was one of the last of the games on the Silver Range before parent company [[Telecomsoft]] spun off the management of that label into its own subsidiary, [[Silverbird Software|Silverbird]], in late 1987.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hewison | first=Richard | date=May 2004 | url=https://archive.org/details/RetroGamer_No1-No11/Retro%20Gamer%20%E2%84%9604/page/n46/ | title=Memories of Telecomsoft | journal=Retro Gamer | publisher=Future plc | volume= | issue=4 | pages=43–49 | via=the Internet Archive}}</ref> The game supports both [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]]'s and [[Kempston Micro Electronics]]'s joystick as controllers, as well as keyboard control through the [[ZX Spectrum]]'s built-in keyboard.<ref name=crash /> Though the [[ZX Spectrum 128]] was out by the time of ''Oriental Hero''{{'s}} release, the game does not take advantage of that system's increased memory and supports the original 48-KB ZX Spectrum.<ref name=sinclairuser />

Like its predecessor, ''Oriental Hero'' received mixed, mostly negative, reviews. A writer for the ''[[Airdrie & Coatbridge Advertiser]]'' called it a guilty pleasure—"a budget game which I know I shouldn't have enjoyed, but I did"—that provided "a few hours worth of fun". The writer praised the pixel art of the character sprites and felt the fighting mechanics worked "reasonably well" but called the command of movement "somewhat limited, and the [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] "leav[ing] a bit to be desired". Despite the game's steep difficulty curve, the writer called the challenge addictive—"a couple of hours whisked by before I knew it"—with the challenge waning after a short while.<ref name=aca /> Tony Dillon of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' meanwhile gave it four stars out of ten, writing that the game "is all so fast ... winning starts becoming a matter of luck".<ref name=sinclairuser />

''[[Your Sinclair]]''{{'s}} Rick Robson deemed the game lacking imagination and found it had nothing to offer for advanced players of kung-fu games but praised the graphics and sound and surmised that it would do well in sales.<ref name=yoursinclair /> Nick Roberts, Ben Stone, and Paul Sumner, in a collective review for ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'', gave the game an average score of 30%. Stone wrote: "''Oriental Hero'' is so incredibly bad it's almost worth a look ... rubbish gameplay, poor graphics and no lasting appeal."<ref name=crash /> Like Robson, Roberts praised the graphics and sound but called the gameplay frustrating to the point of tears: "Wherever, whatever you do, you get killed before realising it. The terribly hard gameplay is a real shame, because otherwise ''Oriental Hero'' would be very addictive as kick-'em-ups go."<ref name=crash /> Sumner called the game "totally unplayable; the graphics are very badly animated, with uninvolving backgrounds. Firebird should know better".<ref name=crash /> The Portuguese newspaper ''[[A Capital]]'' called ''Oriental Hero'' a game to avoid and a black mark on the generally well-regarded catalog of Firebird, the game as a whole "add[ing] nothing to what is already known" and appearing glitchy, especially in the "bad animation" of the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]].<ref name=acapital />
