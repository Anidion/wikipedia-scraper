{{nihongo foot|'''''Galaga '88'''''|ギャラガ'88|Gyaraga Eiti Eito|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1987 [[fixed shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published in Japan by [[Namco]] and in North America and Europe by [[Atari Games]]. It is the third sequel to ''[[Galaxian]]'' (following ''[[Galaga]]'', and ''[[Gaplus]]''). It features significantly improved graphics over the previous games in the series, including detailed backgrounds, larger enemies and greater ship details. The game runs on [[Namco System 1]] hardware.

''Galaga '88'' was a commercial success in Japan, but was not as commercially successful as its predecessors outside of Japan. The game was praised by critics for its gameplay, graphics, and music. Reviewers complimented its new enhancements that changed and innovated the core gameplay, and for standing out among other games at the time. It was ported to the [[TurboGrafx-16]], [[X68000]], and [[Game Gear]] and is included in [[List of Bandai Namco video game compilations|Namco compilations]]. It was followed by ''[[Galaxian3: Project Dragoon]]'' in 1990.

''Galaga '88'' is a [[fixed shooter]] video game. Its plot involves the launch of a starship named the Blast Fighter<ref>{{cite web |title=UGSF Series Official Site |url=https://ugsf-series.com/#galaga88 |publisher=[[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] |access-date=April 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616203836/https://ugsf-series.com/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |language=ja}}</ref> to destroy the hostile Galaga forces and their home planet. Its gameplay is similar to its predecessors; as the Blast Fighter, the player must shoot each of the Galaga aliens, who fly into formation from the top and sides of the playfield.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web |title=Galaga '88 - Videogame by Namco |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7883 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |access-date=August 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812053940/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7883 |archive-date=August 12, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Aliens will make an attempt to hit the player by divebombing towards the bottom of the screen.

''Galaga '88'' consists of five "worlds", each one containing up to four stages, including a bonus stage at the end.

==Development==
===Music===
The soundtrack for ''Galaga {{'}}88'' was composed by Hiroyuki Kawada, a former game designer that created music for games such as ''[[Solvalou]]'', ''[[Yokai Dochuki]]'', and ''[[Valkyrie no Densetsu]]''. Kawada expressed his admiration for its gameplay, and wanted the music and sound effects to convey a sense of entertainment instead of stoicism. For the ''Galactic Dancin'' stages, he created music that tapped into a wide variety of genres, like orchestra, tango, salsa, and big band jazz. Kawada based the idea off his "eclectic" taste in music, and wanted the soundtrack in ''Galaga {{'}}88'' to reflect this. The music was created before the stages themselves were programmed; Kawada composed the tracks while the programmers choreographed the enemy movement to his music.<ref name="VGMO">{{cite web |last1=Burkett |first1=Stephen |last2=Greening |first2=Chris |title=Hiroyuki Kawada Interview: Namco Sounds in the 1980s |url=http://www.vgmonline.net/hiroyukikawadainterview/ |website=VGMOnline |date=18 September 2016 |access-date=August 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229164626/http://www.vgmonline.net/hiroyukikawadainterview/ |archive-date=December 29, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since ''Galaga {{'}}88'' utilized the System 1 hardware, Kawada was able to experiment with the board's sound channels: "I loved bringing together the richness of the timbres in FM synthesis, the wave table synthesis that played a crucial role in the Namco sound, and the PCM synthesis that was indispensable for those low resolution real sound effects. When they were all combined and their distinctive colors were used to the fullest, it was possible to create a wealth of musical variety to complement the classic traditional sounds of the ''Galaga'' series."<ref name="VGMO"/>

A prototype of ''Galaga {{'}}88'' was demonstrated at the [[Japan Amusement Machine]] (JAMMA) trade show in October 1987, presented alongside ''[[Pac-Mania]]'', [[Bravoman]], and ''[[Assault (1988 video game)|Assault]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Videos Unveiled At JAMMA '87 |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19871101p.pdf |access-date=August 17, 2020 |agency=Game Machine |issue=319 |publisher=Amusement Press |date=November 1, 1987 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523100822/https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19871101p.pdf |archive-date=May 23, 2020 |page=26 |language=ja |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Namco]] released the game in Japan in December 1987.<ref>{{cite web |title=Galaga '88 |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/id/M729819 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |access-date=4 September 2021}}</ref> In Europe, the game made its debut at London's [[Amusement Trades Exhibition International]] (ATEI) in January 1988.<ref name="TGM3"/> The game was released in April 1988 in North America, and was published by [[Atari Games]] in North America and Europe as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America.<ref name="Atari"/><ref name="TGM3"/>
