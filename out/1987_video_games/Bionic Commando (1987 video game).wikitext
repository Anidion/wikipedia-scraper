'''''Bionic Commando''''', released in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''''Top Secret'''''|トップシークレット|Toppu Shīkuretto|lead=yes}} is a [[Run and gun video game|run and gun]] [[platform game]] released by [[Capcom]] in [[Arcade video game|arcades]] in 1987. It was designed by [[Tokuro Fujiwara]] as a successor to his earlier "wire action" platformer ''[[Roc'n Rope]]'' (1983), building on its [[grappling hook]] mechanic; he was also the designer of ''[[Commando (arcade game)|Commando]]'' (1985).<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Makaimura o Tsukutta Otoko: Fujiwara Tokurō-shi Interview ni Tsuite |script-title=ja:(「魔界村」を創った男：藤原得郎氏インタビューについて) |trans-title=The Man Who Made Ghosts’n Goblins: Interview with Tokuro Fujiwara |magazine=[[:ja:CONTINUE (雑誌)|CONTINUE]] |date=October 2003 |volume=12 |lang=ja |url=http://nesgbgg.seesaa.net/article/115080128.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306144502/http://nesgbgg.seesaa.net/article/115080128.html |archive-date=2009-03-06 <!-- |lay-url=https://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/tokuro-fujiwara/  -->|access-date=2021-04-16 }}</ref> The music was composed by [[Harumi Fujita]] for the [[Yamaha YM2151]] [[sound chip]].<ref name="Tamiya"/>

The game was advertised in the United States as a sequel to ''Commando'', going as far to refer to the game's main character as Super Joe (the protagonist of ''Commando'') in the promotional brochure,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Arcade Flyer Archive - Video Game: Bionic Commando, Capcom |url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=122&image=1}}</ref> who was originally an unnamed member of a "special commando unit" in the Japanese and international versions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcadeflyers.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=5888|title=The Arcade Flyer Archive - Video Game: Bionic Commando, Capcom}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcadeflyers.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=5702|title=The Arcade Flyer Archive - Video Game: Top Secret, Capcom}}</ref>

The protagonist is a commando equipped with a [[bionic]] arm featuring a [[grappling hook|grappling gun]], allowing him to pull himself forward or swing from the ceiling. Despite being a [[platform game]], the player cannot jump. To cross gaps or climb ledges, the hero must use the bionic arm.

It was later released for several home systems ([[porting|ported]] by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]] and published by Go!). Capcom later produced a home version for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], also titled ''[[Bionic Commando (1988 video game)|Bionic Commando]]'', that was drastically different from the arcade game.

== Plot ==
The story takes place ten years after an unspecified World War between two warring factions.<ref name=usarcademanualp1>{{cite video game|title=Bionic Commando|platform=Arcade|developer=Capcom|level=Instruction manual, page 1|quote=It has been 10 years since the devastating world war. The enemy surprised us with gigantic missiles this time.}}</ref> The game follows a commando who must infiltrate an enemy base and foil the enemy's plot to launch missiles. The hero must stop a missile from launching and then fight the final boss, the leader of the enemy forces, guarded by an armed bodyguard.

== Gameplay ==
The game is presented in a [[side-scrolling]] format, with eight-way [[scrolling]].<ref name="TGM19">{{cite magazine |title=Capcom: A Captive Audience |magazine=[[The Games Machine]] |date=18 May 1989 |issue=19 (June 1989) |pages=24–5 |url=https://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-19/page/n23/mode/2up}}</ref> Unlike most [[platform games]], the player is unable to jump, instead navigating the level via the use of a mechanical arm that can pull him up ledges. The arm may also be used to collect pickups.

Prizes like points and power-ups can only be obtained from crates that come on the screen in a [[parachute]], which can be revealed by shooting them. Unlike most of the later games, the player cannot use the arm and shoot at the same time, the arm cannot be used in the air and the only power-ups are weapon enhancements.

== Ports ==
There are home ports for [[MS-DOS]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]]. For the Commodore 64, there are two distinct versions: a US version by Capcom, and a UK version by Software Creations. In some versions, there is an additional level between levels 3 and 4, featuring enemy helicopters.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} The UK home computer versions were published by [[U.S. Gold]].<ref name="TGM19"/>

The music for the ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, Amiga, and Commodore 64 PAL conversion was arranged by [[Tim Follin]], using a music playback engine programmed by Follin's brother.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Kurt Kalata of ''[[Hardcore Gaming 101]]'' called ''Bionic Commando "''totally brilliant" for how it replaces the jumping mechanics used in most platformer games with grappling mechanics, writing, "It necessitates almost entirely rewiring one’s brain in order to successfully play the game".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bionic Commando (Arcade) – Hardcore Gaming 101 |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/bionic-commando-arcade/ |access-date=2024-01-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The world record high score for ''Bionic Commando'' was set in October 2007 by Rudy Chavez of [[Los Angeles, California]].
