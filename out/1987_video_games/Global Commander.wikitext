'''''Global Commander''''' (known as '''''The Armageddon Man''''' in Europe) is a [[computer game]] developed by [[Martech]] in 1987 for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].

==Gameplay==
''Global Commander'' is a game in which the player must prevent conflict between the 16 nations of the U.N.N., each with its own level of technology and natural resources. The player's nation can use laser-defense satellites to stop missile attacks launched between nations, as well as three reconnaissance satellites to track military activity. The player receives memos when one nation makes a demand of another, and the player is also able to scan radio frequencies to detect coded messages.<ref name="Dragon140"/>
