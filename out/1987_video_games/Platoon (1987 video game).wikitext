==Gameplay==
[[File:Platoon_(1987_video_game)_Atari_ST_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Planting explosive charges on the bridge (Atari ST screenshot)]]
In Stage 1, the player is in a jungle with a [[side-scrolling]] element. The player is able to navigate vertically and horizontally through the screens. The player must also avoid getting hit by enemies, landing on explosive mines, as well as dodge any booby traps in the way. The goal of the first stage is to find the explosives buried deep within the jungle and then navigate out and plant the explosives on the bridge. After planting the explosives, the player will be in a town and must find a torch and a map of the tunnel system for the next level.<ref name=crash>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/50/platoon.htm|title = CRASH 50 - Platoon}}</ref>

In Stage 2, the player is now in a tunnel system and the point of view has changed to a [[first-person shooter]]. The player is able to navigate through the tunnel system using the map obtained earlier in stage 1. The player must navigate through the tunnel system and collect flares and a compass along the way. Enemies will continuously appear on the screen and the player must kill them quickly in order to advance through the tunnel system.

In Stage 3, the player is stuck in a bunker overnight that is under constant siege by enemy AI. The player must use flares obtained in the tunnel system in order to see enemy AI outside the bunker to be able to shoot them. The player is still in first-person mode and must navigate the cross-hair onto the enemy players in order to shoot at them. A skilled player could make out the silhouettes of enemies amongst the background without the need for flares. As long as the player survives the siege, the level will be successfully completed by the player.

In Stage 4, the player is now navigating through the jungle in a [[third-person view]]. The player has 4 minutes to complete this level and must navigate through the jungle while killing enemies as well as avoiding sniper fire. The compass obtained in the tunnel system is used here to help the player navigate through the jungle. At the end of the jungle is the game's boss, Sergeant Barnes, who is holed up in a brick bunker and shooting at the player. The player must be able to land five grenade shots to defeat Sergeant Barnes.<ref name=crash/>

''Platoon'' received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and sound effects, but criticized its gameplay and difficulty.

The game was reviewed by several magazines at the time of its release, such as ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'',<ref name="cvg"/> ''[[Zzap!64]]'',<ref name="zzap"/> [[The Games Machine]],<ref name="tgm"/> and ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]''.<ref name="ace"/> Some of the reviewers highlighted the game’s faithful adaptation of the movie, its realistic atmosphere, and its varied gameplay. For example, ''Zzap!64'' gave the game a score of 94%, calling it “A superb combat simulation, and simply the best film tie-in to date - not to be missed.”.<ref name="zzap"/> Similarly, ''The Games Machine'' awarded the game 92%, stating that “Really successful film tie-ins have been few and far between, Platoon is one of the few. A sure-fire winner from Ocean."<ref name="tgm"/>

However, other reviewers were less impressed by the game, and pointed out its flaws, such as its high difficulty level, its frustrating controls, and its lack of replay value. For instance, ''ACE'' gave the game a score of 53%, commenting that “Sluggish control responses and scrolling ruin the game's playability, while the garishly clashy display makes it unappealing stuff to look at.”<ref name="ace"/>

In 1993, ''[[Commodore Force]]'' ranked the game at number 16 on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Ton!|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-101/ZZap_64_Issue_101_Commodore_Force_Issue_11_1993_Autumn#page/n32/mode/1up/|website=Commodore Force|date=Autumn 1993|accessdate=2017-09-03|page=33}}</ref>
