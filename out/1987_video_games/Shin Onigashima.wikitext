{{nihongo|'''''Famicom Mukashibanashi: Shin Onigashima'''''|ふぁみこん昔話 新・鬼ヶ島||lit. "Famicom Fairytales: New Island of Ogres"}}, often simply referred to as '''''Shin Onigashima''''', is an [[adventure game]] developed by [[Nintendo R&D4]] and Pax Softnica and published by [[Nintendo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tay.kinja.com/the-toy-conundrum-1510661858|title=The Toy Conundrum|last=Pink Zapper Helmet|date=March 2, 2014|website=Kinja|access-date=January 10, 2019|quote=While we had basic text adventures like Zork and Colossal Cave Adventure, they had visual novels like The Portopia Serial Murder Case, Shin Onigashima and Snatcher.}}</ref> It was first released on two disk cards for the [[Famicom Disk System|Family Computer Disk System]]. The first disk was released on September 4, 1987, while the second disk was released September 30. The driving force behind the series, Tatsuya Hishida of Nintendo EAD, was responsible for directing the game, creating the characters, and crafting the storyline.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Shin onigashima screenshot1.png|thumb|Donbe (left) and Hikari (right) in ''Shin Onigashima'']]

The game is played by selecting commands which make the characters talk to, use, or examine various objects or characters. Progress is marked by changes in the illustrative image in the top-right corner of the screen. One of the most distinctive features of the game is the "Change Character" command, used to switch between the two main characters (Donbe, the boy, and Hikari, the girl). The characters can move through the story separately at times, and may be called upon to do tasks that the other main character cannot accomplish on their own. The use of this command in certain situations can trigger dialogue particular to each character, bringing out the peculiarities of each. This is essentially a form of zapping{{clarify|date=January 2023}}, but a similar command was implemented in the 1995 [[visual novel]] ''[[Eve Burst Error|EVE Burst Error]]''.

The game also utilizes the Disk System's feature of being able to exchange game discs while the device is powered on. The game is divided into two discs, and the player must exchange disks while the Disk System is still powered on in order to activate the second disc (note: Disc 2 is not playable without the first). This format was also used in the game's sequel ''[[Yūyūki]]'' and the ''[[Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Kōkeisha|Famicom Tantei Club]]'' series.

==Plot==
Once upon a time, there was an elderly couple living in Nagakushi village, a small village located far up in the mountains. The couple had no children, until one day, they were entrusted with the care of an infant boy and girl, as prophesied in a dream. The years went by, and when the two children were 8 years old, there was a terrible occurrence in the western capital. A dragon suddenly appeared in the city, turning humans into [[Oni (folklore)|oni]], ogres that suck away the souls of other humans. The oni advanced as far as Nagakushi village, stealing away the souls of the elderly couple. Fortunately the two children were left unharmed, and they set out on a quest to save their adopted parents, not realizing that this adventure would reveal the secret of their true origins...

==Characters==
The two protagonists are listed with their default names.

;Donbe
:A small boy resembling a [[Cave dweller|caveman]] with long blue hair that obstructs his eyes, and a teal robe. He was born from a rice bowl floating down the river.

;Otohime
:The legendary hero that sealed the Avatar of Darkness into a treasure box ages ago. She is also the princess of the Ryukyujin, a tribe living deep beneath the seas.

==Development==
As indicated by the game's subtitle, the game borrows heavily from traditional Japanese fairytales such as [[Momotarō]] and [[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Princess Kaguya]]. Most text-based adventure games of the time were written in the style of mystery novels, where the player had to solve a murder or crime of some sort, but Shin Onigashima's fairytale-like plot gave a much softer and accessible feel to the genre.

A conversion of the game was included as part of ''Heisei Shin Onigashima'', released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in 1997 and 1998. It was also redone for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as part of the [[Classic NES Series|Famicom Mini series]] on August 4, 2004. The [[Virtual Console]] release came on June 19, 2007. The game was never released outside Japan.

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
The game's difficulty is rather high, as very few hints are given in solving mysteries, and many circumstances can lead to the "game over" screen. Even so, the game's warm graphics and plot consisting of numerous interwoven Japanese fairytales was positively received by fans and critics alike. The in-game music, written by [[Koji Kondo]], is regarded in equally high esteem, and the game is considered a success as Nintendo's first text-based adventure game.{{According to whom|date=October 2022}}

The 1989 "All Soft Catalog" issue of ''[[Famitsu|Famicom Tsūshin]]'' (now ''Famitsu'') included ''Shin Onigashima'' in its list of the [[List of video games considered the best|best games of all time]]. In particular, they gave it the [[List of Game of the Year awards|award]] for the best "Adventure" game of all time.<ref name="Famitsu1989">{{cite book |chapter='83〜'89 ベストヒットゲーム大賞 |trans-chapter='83〜'89 Best Hit Game Awards |title=ファミコン通信 〜 '89全ソフトカタログ |trans-title=Famicom Tsūshin: '89 All Software Catalog |series=[[Famicom Tsūshin]] |date=15 September 1989 |page=138 |chapter-url=https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/M/MULTi88/20200420/20200420025318.jpg}}</ref> In 2013, [[IGN]] noted similarities to later adventure games such as ''[[Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Kōkeisha|Famicom Tantei Club]]'', ''[[Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School]]'', ''[[999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors]]'', and ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]''.<ref>[http://ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/the-secret-library-of-the-famicom The Secret Library of the Famicom – IGN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Nine years after the release of the Disk System version, {{nihongo|''BS Shin Onigashima''|BS新・鬼ヶ島}} was released on September 29, 1996, for the Super Famicom's [[Satellaview]] unit.<ref name=kameb>{{cite web|url = http://www.f3.dion.ne.jp/~kameb/satella/st_prg/st_prg.htm|script-title = ja:スーパーファミコンアワー番組表|publisher = The Satellaview History Museum|language = Japanese|date = 2008-02-12|last = Kameb|accessdate = 2009-03-27|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120401183851/http://www.f3.dion.ne.jp/~kameb/satella/st_prg/st_prg.htm|archivedate = 2012-04-01}}</ref> The game was broadcast via the [[St.GIGA]] [[Broadcasting Satellite (Japanese)|BS Satellite]], and was downloadable within the ''[[BS-X]]'' menu from the {{nihongo|Broadcast Clubhouse|語り部の小屋|Katari bu no Koya}}.<ref name=kameb/> ''BS Shin Onigashima'' takes its plot from the original version of the game, but is mostly presented from the viewpoint of the three helpers who join the protagonists during the game (the dog, monkey and pheasant).<ref name=nintendosat>{{cite web|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n02/shvc/ao4j/index.html|script-title=ja:平成 新・鬼ケ島（前編・後編）|publisher = [[Nintendo]]|language = Japanese|accessdate = 2011-05-04}}</ref> In-game music was transmitted via radio, and Ittaisan, the game's narrator, appears in-between chapters to sum up the storyline via [[Satellaview#SoundLink|SoundLink]]. The character of Ittaisan was voiced by [[Ichirō Nagai]]. The Satellaview version was well received by fans.<ref name=nintendosat/><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/9810/p05/page05.html|script-title=ja:お宝発見！！あんな名作！こんな傑作！|editor = Kushida, Riko|date=October 1998|publisher = [[Nintendo|N.O.M.: Nintendo Online Magazine]]. Vol.2.|page=4.1|language = Japanese|accessdate = 2011-05-04}}</ref>

The Super Famicom version uses the same command menu gameplay implemented in the Disk System version, but the "Change Character" command was not included due to time constraints. Satellaview games were only broadcast during a limited time period, and using the command would complicate the game to an unnecessary degree. New tweaks by the developers were to include platform-style action scenes, and to set time limits for choosing certain commands.

On December 1, 1997, ''BS Shin Onigashima'' was redone for a commercial release on the [[Nintendo Power (cartridge)|Nintendo Power]], as {{nihongo|''Heisei Shin Onigashima''|平成 新・鬼ヶ島||lit. "Heisei Era: New Island of Ogres"}} with the original Disk System game included as a bonus. Its popularity prompted a cartridge release on May 23, 1998. This version was also released in two cartridges, but unlike the Disk System release, it is possible to play the second cartridge without having finished the first one.

===Changes===
The Satellaview broadcast was divided into four chapters, and in the Super Famicom release,<ref name=nintendosat/> the first two chapters make up the first disk, and the latter two make up the second. "[[Ksitigarbha|Jizo]] Ittaisan" are placed throughout the game, which allow the player to save. There are no time limits for choosing commands, and a golden buddha statue in the likeness of [[Mario]] appears in the first chapter.

The original Disk System version is unlocked after all four chapters are completed. This was not a complete port of the original, as several changes were made to the text and in-game music. An opening demo of Donbe and Kintaro in a sumo match is added, and colors appear darker than the original.

==Game Boy Advance version==
''Famicom Mukashibanashi: Shin Onigashima'' was released for the Game Boy Advance on August 10, 2004 as part of the  [[Classic NES Series|Famicom Mini: Disk System selection]] series. Unlike the previous installations, the GBA version does not require changing between disks; the entire game is played on one cartridge. The game itself saw no major changes, but on-screen menus were fixed to accommodate the GBA. Load and save times were eliminated by the use of the faster cartridge, allowing the game to run without breaks.
