'''''Nebulus''''' is a [[platform game]] created by John M. Phillips and published by [[Hewson Consultants]] in the late 1980s for home computer systems. International releases and ports were known by various other names: '''''Castelian''''', {{nihongo|'''''Kyorochan Land'''''|キョロちゃんランド|Kyorochan Rando}}, '''''Subline''''', and '''''Tower Toppler'''''.<ref name="Auto0C-1"/>

The game's original 8-bit release received some critical acclaim, in particular the [[Commodore 64]] release, which garnered a Gold Medal award from UK magazine ''[[Zzap!64]]''.

''Nebulus'' was followed by the lesser-known ''Nebulus 2'' for the [[Amiga]] in the 1990s.

''Nebulus'' is a [[platform game]]. The [[player character]], a green creature called Pogo, is on a mission to destroy eight [[tower]]s that have been built in the [[sea]] by planting bombs at the towers' peaks.

The actual gameplay happens at each tower in turn. Pogo starts from the bottom and finds the way to the top. The towers are [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]-shaped and have ledges on their outside, either horizontal, forming [[stairs]] or connected by [[elevator]]s. A notable feature of the game is that when Pogo walks left or right the tower behind him turns clockwise or counterclockwise with a convincing sense of depth. This was noted favourably in reviews of the game.

During the ascent, Pogo encounters many different enemies, mostly shaped like basic geometric shapes. Pogo can shoot some of the enemies, while some are impervious to shooting. Contact with an enemy knocks Pogo down to the ledge below. If there is no ledge below, Pogo falls into the sea and drowns.

At the top of the tower, Pogo enters a door to trigger the tower's destruction mechanism. Pogo then boards his [[submarine]] and enters a [[bonus stage]] (in some versions, but not for example in the [[ZX Spectrum]] version), where he can shoot various kinds of [[fish]] to score bonus points.

== Releases and ports ==

The game was originally released by [[Hewson Consultants|Hewson]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Acorn Archimedes]]. The US version, which was published by [[U.S. Gold]], was released under the title ''Tower Toppler''. A version for the [[Atari 7800]] was also released with this title.<ref name="Auto0C-2"/>

The [[Game Boy]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] versions of ''Castelian'' were developed by [[Bits Studios]] and released in the United States by Triffix and in Japan by Hiro Entertainment; in these, the lead character is called Julius. The Game Boy and Nintendo versions were later released in Japan as ''Kyoro Chan Land'', which replaced Julius with [[Kyorochan]], jewels with Chocoballs, altered the enemy graphics and (in the Famicom version) added a password system and a pause feature. The Italian bootleg version was called ''Subline''. The Nintendo versions were composed by [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]], and the title songs were covered by Whittaker from the original Tower Toppler game's title screen. In the Famicom version, the title screen plays what is the bonus game theme from the US version.

In [[2004 in video gaming|2004]] it was re-released on the [[C64 Direct-to-TV]]. The C64 DTV version made comeback on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] download service in Europe on June 13, 2008 and later in North America on May 4, 2009.<ref name="Auto0C-3"/>
