'''''Rad Racer''''', known as {{nihongo foot|'''''Highway Star'''''|ハイウェイスター|Haiwei Sutā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan, is a [[racing video game]] developed and published by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1987. In this game, players drive a [[Ferrari&nbsp;328]] or a generic [[Formula One]] racing machine through a racecourse. The game was released in North America and Europe months after its debut. The title became well known for being one of two titles from Square that made use of [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic 3D]], which was made possible by wearing a pair of [[Anaglyph 3D|anaglyph]] glasses. Square president [[Masafumi Miyamoto]] initially conceived the game as an opportunity for developer [[Nasir Gebelli]] to demonstrate his 3D programming skills. Gebelli developed, and often drew by hand, the graphics for the game's 3D mode.

The game sold 1.96 million copies and is considered one of the best racing games on the NES, but was criticized as being derivative of other racing games from the period. Reviewers widely compared the game to ''[[Out Run]]'', though opined that ''Rad Racer'' was different in some ways, and they praised the sense of speed. The game appeared in the 1989 film ''[[The Wizard (1989 film)|The Wizard]]'' and was one of three games to feature a unique competition course in the 1990 [[Nintendo World Championship]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Radracer3D.gif|frame|left|Players can engage a [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic 3D]] mode by pressing the select button while wearing included [[Anaglyph 3D|anaglyph]] 3D glasses.]]
''Rad Racer'' is a [[racing game]] in which the player races in a "Transamerica" race from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].<ref name="manual2">{{cite book | author=Nintendo staff | date=1987 | title=Rad Racer ''Instruction Manual'' | publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] | pages=2}}</ref> The gameplay is sprite-based, and the player controls the car from a "behind the vehicle" perspective.<ref name="3D" /> At the start of the game, the player chooses between two types of car to race, either a [[Ferrari 328#GTB/GTS Turbo|328 Twin Turbo]] or an [[Lotus 99T|F1 Machine]], though both cars perform exactly the same.<ref name="cores" /> The objective is to complete eight driving stages of varying skylines, environments, and locations, including [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Athens]].<ref name="cores" /><ref name="allgames" /> Competitors' vehicles get faster as the stages progress and include [[Volkswagen Beetle]]s to [[Ferrari Testarossa]]s.<ref name="allgames" /> The player's car can accelerate to 100&nbsp;km/h, which [[turbocharger|turbo]] can then be activated to accelerate to a maximum of 255&nbsp;km/h.<ref name="allgames" /><ref name="manual4">{{cite book | author=Nintendo staff | date=1987 | title=Rad Racer ''Instruction Manual'' | publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] | pages=4}}</ref> The player can brake, steer, and change the background music while driving.<ref name="manual4" /> Hitting any obstacles or other cars may cause the player's vehicle to flip and crash.<ref name="cores" /> Players have a limited amount of time to reach the next "checkpoint" in the course, which is indicated by a checkered flag; passing the flag adds additional time or may signal the end of the course. Players have a simulated dashboard that contains a progress bar, [[speedometer]], [[tachometer]], score, and time remaining.<ref name="manual5">{{cite book | author=Nintendo staff | date=1987 | title=Rad Racer ''Instruction Manual'' | publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] | pages=5}}</ref> Unlike in ''[[Out Run]]'' where the [[game over|game ends]] immediately, when time runs out, the player's vehicle coasts and decelerates down to 0&nbsp;km/h before the game ends, giving the player an extra five to ten seconds to possibly reach the next checkpoint.<ref name="drift" />

Players can activate a 3D mode during play by pressing the "Select" button and wearing [[Stereoscopy#3D glasses|3D glasses]].<ref name="3D" /> Players could also use the [[Power Glove]] to control their vehicle.<ref name="ign" /> The game was also compatible with the [[Famicom 3D]], an accessory to the original [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] released in Japan that utilized LCD "shutter glasses" to simulate 3D.<ref name="famicom3d" />

==Development and release==
[[File:Famicom-3D-System.jpg|thumb|right|''Rad Racer'' was developed with the Famicom 3D System in mind.<ref name="lane" />]]

The root cause for the game's development was the then-President of Square [[Masafumi Miyamoto]] wanting to implement newly hired programmer [[Nasir Gebelli]]'s skills with 3D programming previously used to develop games for the [[Apple II]].<ref name="Next Generation p. 89"/><ref name=hawaii/> ''Rad Racer'' was the second title by Square to use anaglyph-based 3D: Gebelli worked on both titles and was influenced by his work on the first 3D game titled ''[[The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner]]''.<ref name="savage" /><ref name=hawaii/> Two game programmers had left Square as Gebelli was hired, resulting in Gebelli to begin programming the game by himself.<ref name=shortinterview>{{Cite web|url= https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/294330/Watch_John_Romeros_90s_chat_with_Nasir_Gebelli_about_coding_Final_Fantasy.php|access-date=July 14, 2021|date=March 22, 2017|publisher=Gamasutra|title= Watch John Romero's '90s chat with Nasir Gebelli about coding Final Fantasy|first=Alex|last=Wawro}}</ref> Gebelli remained in Japan to figure out how to create realistic background movement of the game's scenery while the rest of Square was on vacation in Hawaii.<ref name=hawaii>{{Cite web|url= https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QJhZ0guRPdM |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/QJhZ0guRPdM |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|access-date=July 14, 2021|title=Episode 4 - Nasir Gebelli - Part 2 of 3|website= Apple Time Warp Podcast|date=May 20, 2018|first=John|last=Romero}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Game developer [[Takashi Tokita]] worked on ''Rad Racer'' with Gebelli, alongside developer [[Hiromichi Tanaka]] and artist [[Kazuko Shibuya]] who had previously worked on ''The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner'' with Gebelli.<ref name="dimensions" /><ref name="shmup" /><ref name="runner" />  [[Akitoshi Kawazu]] also contributed to the development as his first game under Square. [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] and [[Akitoshi Kawazu]] both worked on ''Rad Racer'', causing developer [[Koichi Ishii]] to plan for the original ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' by himself briefly.<ref name="solo" />

Though Gebelli found the work challenging, he was able to simulate the moving road in what Tokita described as a "tricky" bit of programming.<ref name=shortinterview/><ref name="dimensions" /> To make the roads look like they were turning in 3D on a typical television, most of which at the time used [[cathode ray tubes]], the developers integrated scrolling by individual scanlines.<ref name="runner" /> ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'' used this method to create game effects for the enemy Odin.<ref name="runner" /> Since the game was not programmed to display single sprites but was drawn line by line, Gebelli came several times a week memorizing Shibuya's instructions on how the courses should be drawn. Shibuya would point out how many pixels and what color the lines had to be to create roads to Gebelli.<ref name="shmup" /> Square produced six different versions of ''Rad Racer'' for different regions to accommodate the different 3D viewing systems needed if players were using either a typical television or the Famicom 3D System and a different version required for the PAL region.<ref name="answer1" /> At the time, programmers usually worked on games individually, which Tokita described having someone to work with as an asset.<ref name="dimensions" /> Tokita designed and wrote the program for the billboards that appear in the game.<ref name="lane" /> Tokita also made all four levels and during the process, he learned that the middle two levels shared assets, which saved time and memory.<ref name="lane" /> Shibuya worked on the character sprites in which Final Fantasy developer Koichi Ishii stated that the sprites of ''3-D Battles of WorldRunner'' and ''Rad Racer'' typify [[Kazuko Shibuya]]’s pixel art style.<ref name="solo" /> Akitoshi Kawazu’s designed the ''Rad Racer''{{'s}} ending that indicated with dots how far the player's progress.<ref name="dots" />

''Rad Racer'' was released in Japan on August 7, 1987.<ref name=JP-date/> It was later released in North America in October 1987 and in Europe on January 15, 1988.<ref name=dates /><ref name=NA-date/> In August 1987, Nintendo released an arcade machine called ''[[Playchoice-10]]'' that contained up to ten popular NES titles.<ref name="PC-10" /> Amongst the eligible NES games, ''Rad Racer'' was also available on the arcade machine.<ref name="retro-PC10" />

''Rad Racer'' was met with favorable reviews, enjoyed commercial success, and sold 1.96 million copies.<ref name="Next Generation p. 89" /><ref name="racing2" /> It also ranked 8th on ''[[Nintendo Power]]'''s player's poll ''Top 30''.<ref name="bNtW9" /> ''[[Famitsu]]'' praised the sense of speed but felt the game was slightly monotonous.<ref name="FamHS" /> Japanese publication ''Family Computer Magazine'' applauded the variety of game landscapes found in different levels.<ref name="crossreview8" /> British magazine ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called it an "extremely playable racing game" and said "things get very fast and competitive as you get further into the game."<ref name="CVG"/>

Retrospective reviews gave the title a more mixed reception. Skyler Miller of ''[[GameSpot]]'', in his article ''The History of Square'', commented that the game bears more than a passing resemblance to ''[[Out Run]]''," but went on to say that "it's more than just a clone" and credited the game with "effectively convey[ing] the proper sense of speed."<ref name="interviews" /> He continued to criticize the 3D effect, stating it created some sense of depth to the gameplay but was hindered by a pronounced screen flickering.<ref name="interviews" /> He concluded that the game does not require 3D features and that it stands on its own as a "fine racing game".<ref name="interviews" /> Craig Harris of ''[[IGN]]'' stated in his retrospective that the game's simplicity and "race or die" focus make it one of the best racing games of its time.<ref name="3D" /> He also mentioned how the power glove does not improve player control, though felt the experience was still fun.<ref name="3D" /> ''Hardcore Gaming 101''’s Jeremy Peeples and Neil Foster praised the game's sense of speed and arcade levels of difficulty, but criticized the lack of personality and faulty collision physics.<ref name="cores" /><ref name="drift" />

''Rad Racer'' was ranked number 57 on ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Top 100 Nintendo Entertainment System games and was called "iconic" and one of the NES's premier racing games.<ref name="ign" /> ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' included the game amongst thirteen others in their greatest 8-bit video games of all time list.<ref name="AzYtE" />

===Legacy===
Due to most of ''Rad Racer''{{'s}} sales being from the United States, ''Rad Racer II'' was developed and released only in North America for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and the arcade.<ref name="racing2" /><ref name="arcadia" /><ref name="interviews" /> The sequel featured eight new tracks and new music but similar gameplay.<ref name="new" /> ''Hardcore Gamer 101'' said that steering was looser than the first game and rival cars more aggressive, leading to a less enjoyable playing experience.<ref name="racing2" /> Despite the efforts of Square to make unique games with 3D features such as ''Rad Racer'' and ''[[3-D Worldrunner]]'', and high sales, the company was in financial trouble.<ref name="legacy" /> These events are what led to a final attempt at a breakout hit, ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name="legacy" /> ''Rad Racer'' appeared in a scene in the movie ''[[The Wizard (1989 film)|The Wizard]]''.<ref name="wizard" /> It was also one of three games, including ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Tetris (NES video game)|Tetris]]'', featured at the 1990 [[Nintendo World Championship]] with an exclusive racing level to complete as one of the rounds of competition.<ref name="beat" /> The limited-edition release of the game's cartridge used in the tournament is now one of the rarest and most valuable Nintendo games available.<ref name="champion" />
