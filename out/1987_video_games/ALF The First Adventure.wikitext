==Gameplay==
[[File:AlftheFirstAdventureC64Screenshot.png|left|thumb|ALF is trying to evade Willie Tanner.]]

All versions of the game start off with a basic introduction into the game itself along with some basic instructions on how to control the ALF character.

As ALF, the player has to run around and collect [[pizza]]s and parts for his [[starship]] while trying not get caught by [[Willie Tanner]], as Willie will take away all of ALF's possessions; forcing him to start over again. ALF must also grab cats, but ALF must eat a pizza before a cat can be picked up.<ref name="listentome">[http://www.listentome.net/games16.php ''ALF: The First Adventure''] at Listentome.net</ref><ref>[http://vaguelyunpleasant.com/2008/03/16/hey-lets-talk-about-every-commodore-64-game-i-ever-owned-part-1-alf/ ''ALF: The First Adventure''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426034926/http://vaguelyunpleasant.com/2008/03/16/hey-lets-talk-about-every-commodore-64-game-i-ever-owned-part-1-alf/ |date=April 26, 2012 }} at Vaguely Unpleasant</ref> Getting caught by the [[Animal control service|dog catcher]] is an alternative form of "punishment" in the game; only the player's nemesis Willie can release him from the [[animal shelter|pound]]. Since Willie is unable to rescue ALF after being locked up the third time, the situation eventually becomes an automatic [[game over]]. All versions of the game have a strict time limit to accomplish everything.<ref name="piratesbay"/><ref name="listentome"/> They also have ALF claiming the player's loss is being blamed "on the alien." Players who make the high score become members of the ''Honorary Melmac Skleen Club''; which consists of the high score list and an [[in-joke]] for fans of the television series.

The game is almost identical to ''[[Pac-Man]]'' in terms of gameplay.<ref name="piratesbay"/> All the maps in the game usually span about an area of either 2x2 or 2x3; totalling four to six screens of action per stage.
