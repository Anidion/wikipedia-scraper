{{nihongo|'''''Touch Down Fever'''''|タッチダウンフィーバー}} is a [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] [[American football]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[SNK]]. It was later ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and was released in North America by SNK in February 1991 and in [[Japan]] by [[K. Amusement Leasing]] on November 11, 1988, titled as {{nihongo|'''''Touch Down Fever: American Football'''''|タッチダウンフィーバー アメリカンフットボール}}.

==Gameplay==
At first glance, it resembles [[Irem]]'s 1983 arcade game ''[[10 Yard Fight]]'', but with rotating joysticks that were previously used in SNK's ''[[Ikari Warriors]]''. Most of the official rules are in effect as well as most major running and passing plays.<ref name="mobygames">{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/touchdown-fever| title = Basic game summary | publisher = MobyGames| accessdate = 2008-11-10}}</ref> [[Field goal (football)|Field goal]]s and [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]s are also included, but, players cannot make horse collar [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/NES/touchdown_fever/| title = Advanced game summary | publisher = NeoSeeker| accessdate = 2008-11-10}}</ref>

==NES Version==
This version featured teams that originated from cities that had NFL teams at the time (such as Seattle and Phoenix) but not the colors or the nicknames as the game was not officially licensed by the NFL. Graphics were toned down as they were for many arcade games ported to the system. The human players could only select five basic plays: Long Pass, Short Pass, QB Sneak, Backs (a hand-off) or Punt/Field Goal (Field Goals could only be attempted if the line of scrimmage was within the 15-yard line). Field Goals would always go through the uprights unless blocked by the opposing team. Despite the NFL not adopting this rule until the 1994 season, a player could attempt a [[2-point conversion]] if so desired.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Touch Down Fever'' on their November 1, 1987 issue as being the seventeenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=319|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 November 1987|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>
