He developed and released ''[[Revolution (video game)|Revolution]]'', which later influenced on creation of ''Deflektor''. The game was based on a simple physical phenomenon which was further modified in terms of game mechanics. Panayi was inspired to create the game by observing scientific software that worked with lasers. The development was carried out in the key of being different from existing trends in the gaming industry.

The development of the original game for the ZX Spectrum was handled by Panayi himself and was published by Gremlin Graphics. A month before it release date, the game was announced in magazines.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=January 6, 1988 |title=Popular Computing Weekly |url=https://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/PopularComputingWeekly/Issue871231/Pages/PopularComputingWeekly87123100025.jpg |journal=[[Popular Computing Weekly]] |page=25}}</ref>
