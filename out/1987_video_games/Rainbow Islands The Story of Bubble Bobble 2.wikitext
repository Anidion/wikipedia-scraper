{{nihongo|'''''Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2'''''|レインボーアイランド}} is a 1987 [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Taito]],<ref name="klov">{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9255 |title=Rainbow Islands The Story Of Bubble Bobble 2| publisher=The International Arcade Museum|access-date=2014-06-24}}</ref> with the arcade version licensed to [[Romstar]] for North American manufacturing and distribution. The game is the sequel to ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'' from the previous year, and it is the second of four arcade games in the series (followed by ''[[Bubble Symphony]]'' and ''[[Bubble Memories]]'', but itself has two direct sequels: ''[[Parasol Stars]]'' and ''[[Bubble Bobble Part 2]]''). The game was ported to [[home computer]]s and [[home video game console]]s.

The "bubble dragons" of the first game, Bubblun and Bobblun (known as "Bub and Bob" in the western releases) appear in ''Rainbow Islands'' in their human forms as "Bubby" and "Bobby". Also unlike the first game, players must now "alternate" (i.e., take turns), with player one as Bubby (green shirt), and player 2 as Bobby (blue shirt).

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Rainbow islands1.PNG|thumb|left|The second stage (arcade version)]]
[[File:Rainbow Islands PCB.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Arcade PCB (Taito B22)]]

Following the events of ''Bubble Bobble'', Bubby and Bobby set out to defeat the "Dark Shadow" and rescue the Rainbow Islands. The Dark Shadow is the entity responsible for the events in ''Bubble Bobble''.<ref name="SatMag12">{{cite magazine |last=Leadbetter |first=Richard |title=Paint the Whole World with a Rainbow!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=12 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1996|pages=48–51}}</ref> The game is set on a chain of ten islands, each one with a different theme. Each island provides four rounds of game-play, and once these are complete the player moves to the next island in the chain. In each round the player must get to the top before the sea level rises and kills them. The islands get progressively more difficult, with enemies moving much faster on the later ones. These are depicted on a map screen before the start of each island.

Players can release rainbows that act as weapons, makeshift platforms, and item collectors. Slinging rainbows damages any enemies and acquires any items that the rainbows come in contact with. When jumped upon, they fall down, beating any enemies below them, and releasing a damage field above them.<ref name="SatMag12" /> Collecting power-ups increases the player's speed, the speed of the rainbows and how many are spawned. If players take too long in a level, water will start to rise up from the bottom of the stage, and will kill the player character if it rises above his head.<ref name="SatMag12" />

Like ''Bubble Bobble'' before it, the game has multiple endings. To get the "True and Happy" ending the player must find and complete the three secret islands (although most consumer versions of the game completely lack the secret islands because of budget constraints<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uridiumauthor.blogspot.co.uk/2018/03/rainbow-islands.html|title = Rainbow Islands}}</ref>). These islands are not visible until all 7 big diamonds are collected. To get a big diamond, the player must collect seven different-colored small diamonds on the island and finish the round. The small diamonds are found by destroying enemies by dropping a rainbow on them from above or destroying them with various special items. After collecting the small diamonds, a word "NICE" appears. If the small diamonds are collected in the correct order, the player will get to a secret room at the end of each island, which contains a permanent power up. The color of the small diamonds depends on where the fallen enemies land, so the player can somewhat determine which diamond colors will drop.

The scoring system also has secrets, which allow vastly higher scores to be achieved than normal.<ref name="rgamer79">{{citation | title=The Ultimate Guide to... #01 Rainbow Islands | journal=Retro Gamer | issue=79 | pages=24–29 | date= July 2010 | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]}}</ref>

== Ports ==
The European [[Master System]] port contains a bug that crashes the game after Level 7, sending the player back to the title screen. If the level select code is used to access Level 8, the same glitch occurs at the end of that level completely preventing the player from seeing the ending. The Brazilian version has fixed this glitch.<ref name="dark">{{cite web|url=http://www.smspower.org/forums/6843-WhatsUpWithRainbowIslands |title=What's Up With Rainbow Islands?|publisher=smspower.org|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref>

The European version of the NES port, developed by Ocean, is more faithful to the arcade version, whereas the Japanese and North American versions have original level designs and story intermissions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

'''''Rainbow Islands Extra Version''''' is a modified version of ''Rainbow Islands''; the layouts of the islands remain exactly the same except the stages' enemies and bosses appear in a different order (much like ''Bubble Bobble'''s Super Mode).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9256 |title=Rainbow Islands Extra Version| publisher=The International Arcade Museum|access-date=2014-06-24}}</ref> In addition, the bosses were made more difficult by adding more variety to their behavior. Rainbow Islands Extra was released in limited quantities in the arcade. The game was also included as a mode in the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] version of ''Rainbow Islands''. The game was also included in the Japanese compilation ''[[Taito Memories|Taito Memories II Jōkan]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and the [[PlayStation Portable]] collection ''[[Taito Legends Power-Up|Taito Memories Pocket]]''.

''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' wrote in 1994 that "Taito's ''Rainbow Islands'' has all the ingredients for a superb videogame – incentives, copious rewards and bonuses, and intelligent bosses".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Rules of the Game|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|date=September 1994 |issue=12|page=51}}</ref>

Despite these accomplishments, in his review of the ''Bubble Bobble Featuring Rainbow Islands'' pack, Rich Leadbetter of ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' said ''Rainbow Islands'' was "vastly underrated and over-looked". He added that the gameplay still felt fresh and unique despite the passage of years, and was good enough to make the collection a must-have by itself.<ref name="SatMag12" />

===Accolades===
The Amiga version of ''Rainbow Islands'' was the first game to make #1 on ''[[Amiga Power]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s annual ''All Time Top 100'' list in 1991,<ref>[http://amr.abime.net/issue_419_pages All-Time Top 100 Games] {{cite magazine |date=May 1991 |magazine=Amiga Power |issue=Supplemental |page=4}}</ref> and again in 1992.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=May 1992 |title=The All-Time Top 100 Games: (1) Rainbow Islands |url=https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Power_Issue_13_1992-05_Future_Publishing_GB/page/n31/mode/2up |magazine=[[Amiga Power]] |issue=13 |pages=32–5}}</ref> It held the spot for years until losing to ''[[Sensible Soccer (series)|Sensible Soccer]]'', which retained the title for the rest of the magazine's run. The Mega Drive version was the 9th best game of all time, according to ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' magazine's "Mega Top 100 Carts" in 1992.
