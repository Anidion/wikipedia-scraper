==Gameplay==
The player controls the eponymous Mr. Weems, the bespectacled protagonist who must wander through the six level, vampire-infested maze. The player fights vampires using his garlic gun. There is also a garlic pill which makes Mr. Weems immune from attack for a while.  He also has to collect keys to open locked doors which block access to higher levels.  The objective of the game is to reach the lair of the Great She Vampire and defeat her using a stake, mallet, mega-garlic piece, mirror and crucifix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=29&page=14|title=Redirecting}}</ref>

==Reception==
