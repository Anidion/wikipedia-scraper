'''''Dizzy – The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure''''' is an [[Adventure game|adventure]]-[[platform game]], the first video game featuring the character [[Dizzy (series)|Dizzy]], an [[anthropomorphic]] egg. The game was designed by two British brothers, the [[Oliver Twins]]. ''Dizzy'' was published by [[Codemasters]] and was released in 1987.

==Gameplay==
The game is a [[platform game|platform]] adventure where Dizzy must search the [[fairy tale]] land of Katmandu for a Leprechaun's Wig, a Cloud's Silver Lining, a Vampire Dux Feather, and a Troll Brew and deposit them in a cauldron to make a potion to defeat the evil wizard Zaks. The gameplay involves collecting items and moving to other locations where the item is required; for example, at one point a raincoat is needed to protect against damaging rain. This is made more difficult because only one item can be carried at any given time. The game includes several lines from [[J. Milton Hayes]]' poem ''[[The Green Eye of the Yellow God]]'' on banners in certain screens, where they serve as clues on how to solve some puzzles.

Unlike later games in the series, which focus more on the inventory-based puzzles, this game features a very large number of hazards that kill the player on contact. With only three lives initially to complete the game, this made the game challenging to complete.

==Development==
The Oliver Twins said in an interview, on the British television show ''When Games Attack'', that the character Dizzy was originally not supposed to be an egg at all but just a face with hands and feet. They then said they accepted everyone thought he was an egg and decided to go with that. They also said they used to plan out levels on the back of spare rolls of wallpaper.

Dizzy gets his name from the character's tumbles and somersaults while jumping, a feature inspired by the Oliver Twins' graphics software ''Panda Sprites'' which enabled them to rotate an image easily so each frame did not have to be manually drawn. The software distorted complex [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] so the character was required to be simple, hence the choice of an egg.
