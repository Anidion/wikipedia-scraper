==History==

===Background===
Founded by Les Crane, Walt Bilofsky, and Mike Duffy, [[The Software Toolworks]]<ref name="Biersdorfer" /> was known for its ''[[Chessmaster 2000]]'', a chess simulator. Norm Worthington and Mike Duffy also played a role in the program's development.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

The original photograph used to depict [[Mavis Beacon (character)|Mavis Beacon]] was that of Haitian-born model Renee L'Esperance. The name "Mavis" was derived from [[Mavis Staples]], the lead vocalist for the ''[[The Staple Singers|Staple Singers]]'', and the surname "Beacon" was chosen for its association with a guiding light.<ref name="auto3">{{cite news |last=Michallon |first=Clémence |date=March 14, 2022 |title=Mavis Beacon was the top typing teacher in the US before she vanished.

===Development===
The program's early versions supported both the traditional QWERTY keyboard layout and the alternative Dvorak Simplified Keyboard layout.<ref>[https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/04/take-a-deep-dive-into-mavis-beacon-teaches-typing/ Take A Deep Dive Into Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing!], Rhett Jones, Kotaku Australia, April 10, 2017, access-date: August 18, 2023</ref><ref>[https://www.amigareviews.leveluphost.com/mavisbe2.htm Disk tutorial * £29.99 * Software Toolworks], Amiga Format, July 1993, access-date: August 18, 2023</ref>[[File:Mavis-Beacon-Teaches-Typing-screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A screenshot from the Window version of Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing showing a typing game that features car racing|A typing game in ''Mavis Beacon'' featuring car racing (Windows version)]]Since its initial release in 1987, ''Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing'' has undergone numerous iterations. The 2011 Ultimate Mac Edition by Software MacKiev introduced two-player competitive typing network games, integration with iTunes, Dvorak keyboard support, practice typing song lyrics, RSS news feeds, and classic novels.<ref>[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1675910/Mavis_Beacon_Teaches_Typing/ Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing on Steam], access-date: August 18, 2023</ref> In 2021, [[Encore, Inc.]] released ''Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing 2020''.<ref name="Biersdorfer" />

===Sales===
In 1999, the series had sold over six million copies.<ref name="Biersdorfer"/> In 2000, two products from the franchise were on the Top Selling Educational Software list. ''Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing 10.0'' is in the fourth position, while ''Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing 5.0'' is ranked eighth.<ref>{{cite web |title=GET INFO |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-04/21/024r-042100-idx.html |access-date=April 15, 2021 |website=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>

Distributions of the software include [[MS-DOS]], [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple IIGS]], [[Atari ST]], [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Palm OS]], and [[Amiga]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Paul Tyrrell |date=June 1993 |title=Amiga Reviews: Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing |url=https://www.amigareviews.leveluphost.com/mavisbe2.htm |website=Amiga Format}}</ref>

===Controversy===
In 2024, a documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, which investigates who is Mavis Beacon. Turns out that the image of a corporately attired Black woman on the software packaging, was not of someone named Mavis Beacon, but rather a Haitian model named Renee L'Esperance. She was paid $500 for posing for the marketing photo, wasn't involved in the development or the sales of the software and did not share in any of the presumably significant profits generated by the product. Ms. L'Esperance herself neither appears in nor is directly quoted in the documentary.<ref>https://variety.com/2024/film/news/seeking-mavis-beacon-director-jazmin-jones-typing-teacher-sundance-1235881667/</ref>

==Gameplay==
Users can find themselves racing a virtual car by accurately typing words that appear on the screen.<ref name="steam">{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1675910/Mavis_Beacon_Teaches_Typing/|title=Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com}}</ref> The program also includes typing drills that present users with passages of text to type out, which provides a comprehensive overview of their progress. Successful completion of lessons and tests can result in the achievement of certificates.<ref name="superkids">{{cite web |title=SuperKids Software Review of Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing Version 5. |url=https://www.superkids.com/aweb/pages/reviews/typing1/mavis/merge.shtml |access-date=April 15, 2021 |website=www.superkids.com}}</ref>
