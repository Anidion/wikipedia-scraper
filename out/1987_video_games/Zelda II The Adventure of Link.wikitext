It is the second installment in the ''[[The Legend of Zelda|Legend of Zelda]]'' series and was released in Japan for the [[Famicom Disk System]] on January 14, 1987—less than one year after the Japanese release and seven months before the North American release of the [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|original ''The Legend of Zelda'']]. ''Zelda II'' was released in North America and the [[PAL region]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in late 1988, almost two years after its initial release in Japan.

''The Adventure of Link'' is a direct sequel to the original ''The Legend of Zelda'', again involving the protagonist [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], on a quest to save [[Princess Zelda]], who has fallen under a sleeping spell. The game's emphasis on [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements is a significant departure from its predecessor. For much of the series' three-decade history, the game technically served as the only sequel to the original game, as all other entries in the series are either prequels or occur in an alternative reality, according to the [[The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|official ''Zelda'' timeline]]. This changed with the release of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'' in 2017 and [[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom|''Tears of the Kingdom'']] in 2023, which serve as the latest chapters to the Zelda continuity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2018/08/05/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-has-been-added-to-the-series-official-timeline/ |title=The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Has Been Added To The Series' Official Timeline |author=Wong, Alistair |work=Siliconera |date=August 5, 2018 |access-date=August 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180806050541/http://www.siliconera.com/2018/08/05/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-has-been-added-to-the-series-official-timeline/ |archive-date=August 6, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The game was a critical and financial success and introduced elements such as Link's "magic meter" and the [[Dark Link]] character that would become commonplace in future ''Zelda'' games, although the role-playing elements, such as experience points and limited [[Life (video games)#Extra lives|lives]] have not been used since in canonical games. ''The Adventure of Link'' was followed by ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1991.

==Gameplay==
''Zelda II: The Adventure of Link'' is an [[action role-playing game]], bearing little resemblance to the [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|first]] or later entries in the ''[[The Legend of Zelda|Legend of Zelda]]'' series. It features [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] areas within a larger [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down]] world map, rather than the mostly top-down perspective of the previous game, which only uses side-scrolling in a few dungeon basement areas. The side-scrolling gameplay and experience system are similar to features of the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series, especially ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''. The game incorporates a strategic combat system, a proximity continue system based on [[Life (gaming)#Extra lives|lives]], an [[experience point]]s system, [[Magic (gaming)|magic spell]]s, and more interaction with [[non-player character]]s. Apart from the non-canonical [[CD-i games from The Legend of Zelda series|CD-i ''The Legend of Zelda'' games]], [[Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon|''Link: The Faces of Evil'' and ''Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon'']], no other game in the series includes a life feature. The side angle is occasionally seen in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|Link's Awakening]]'' and the other [[Game Boy]] entries, which rely primarily on the top-down view.<ref name="game">{{cite video game|title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|developer=[[Nintendo]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=December 1, 1988|platform=[[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]}}</ref>

===Experience levels===
In this installment, Link gains experience points to upgrade his attack, magic, and [[Health (gaming)|life]] by defeating enemies.<ref name="manual">{{cite book|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAASE.pdf|title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link instruction manual|date=December 1, 1988|publisher=[[Nintendo]]}}</ref> He can raise each of these attributes to a maximum of eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. In the Western version of the game, each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the fewest points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. In the original Japanese version, all attributes require the same number of experience points to level up, and the required number is lower, but if the player loses all of his lives, the levels of all attributes will be reset to the lowest of the three (while level upgrades in the Western version are permanent). Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself.<ref name="manual" /> Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in ''The Legend of Zelda'' series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised.<ref name="game" /> When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase but resets his accumulated points to zero.

===Overworld map and side-scrolling===
[[File:Zelda2 Spectacle Rock.png|thumb|upright=1|Overworld view of Death Mountain]]
''The Adventure of Link'' has a dual-mode dynamic of top-down view and side-scrolling view. This duality of either traveling or entering combat is one of many aspects adapted from the [[Role-playing video game|role-playing genre]]. The [[overworld]], the area where the majority of the action occurs in other ''Zelda'' games, has a top-down perspective, but it now serves as a navigational map to the other areas. While traversing [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Hyrule|Hyrule]], figures randomly appear around the player: a small blob denoting easy enemies, a large biped denoting harder enemies, and a Fairy to refill Link's health. The game switches to side-scrolling mode when Link steps onto particular spots in the overworld map to enter towns, buildings, or caves, or when he encounters wandering monsters. This mode has most of the action and danger.<ref name="game" />

===Combat system===
''The Adventure of Link'' has a more complex combat system than its predecessor. Armed with a sword and shield, Link must alternate between standing and crouching positions to attack enemies and defend himself; for example, the Iron Knuckle enemy changes the height of its attack and its shield depending on Link's current stance, forcing Link to change stances until he has a chance to attack safely. Link has the ability to jump, which can be used for attacking tall or airborne enemies and can be used for evasion. Eventually, he can learn techniques for midair downward and upward stabs.<ref name="game" />

===Magic and special items===
Though the ''Zelda'' series is based on Link collecting [[Item (gaming)|items]] in order to progress in the game, these special items grant abilities that either remain in permanent use for the rest of the game or can only be activated in the overworld. In place of actively used items, ''The Adventure of Link'' features eight magic spells for Link to use during action scenes. Each spell is learned from a different wise man in one of the eight towns within Hyrule. Link often must complete [[Quest (gaming)|side-quests]], such as retrieving lost items, before they will teach him their spells. Some spells and items are necessary for advancing in the game. The Life spell becomes the main means of recovering health during action scenes, because healing Fairies are rare.<ref name="game" />

===Replay===
Like its predecessor, ''The Adventure of Link'' allows storing up to three [[Saved game|game sessions]] in the cartridge's memory. Once the game has been completed, selecting the corresponding file in the main menu allows [[New Game Plus|starting a new game]]. This preserves the acquired experience levels, techniques, and magic spells - but no special items, Heart and Magic containers, or extra lives, which must be obtained again.<ref name="game" />

==Plot==
{{Further|The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|label1=Fictional chronology of The Legend of Zelda}}
[[File:Zelda II, The Adventure of Link (North Temple).png|thumb|upright=1|Zelda under an enchanted sleep]]
Several years after the events of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'',<ref>{{cite video game |title=The Legend of Zelda 2: Link no Bōken |developer=[[Nintendo|Nintendo Co., Ltd]] |publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd. |date=January 14, 1987 |platform=[[Family Computer Disk System|Disk System]] |quote=Several years after Gannon was destroyed, Link learns from Impa about another sleeping Princess Zelda.}}</ref> the now-16-year-old [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] notices a strange mark on the back of his left hand, exactly like the crest of Hyrule. He seeks out Impa, who takes him to the North Castle, where a door has been magically sealed for generations. Impa places the back of Link's left hand on the door, and it opens, revealing a sleeping maiden. Impa tells Link that the maiden is [[Princess Zelda|Zelda]] (not the Zelda from the first game), the princess of Hyrule from long ago, and the origin of the titular "Legend of Zelda". Zelda's brother tried to force her into telling their recently deceased father's secrets concerning the [[Triforce]]. Princess Zelda refused to reveal its location, and the prince's wizard friend, in anger, tried to strike her down with a spell. Zelda fell under a powerful sleeping spell, but the wizard was unable to control the wildly arcing magic and was killed by it. The prince, filled with remorse and unable to reverse the spell, had his sister placed in the castle tower, hoping she would one day be awakened. He decreed that princesses born to the royal family from that point on would be named Zelda, in remembrance of this tragedy.<ref name="manual" />

Impa says that the mark on Link's hand means that he is the hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest containing six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even though he has never seen the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered across Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the [[Triforce|Triforce of Courage]]. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, [[Ganon]]'s followers seek to kill Link, as sprinkling his blood on Ganon's ashes will bring Ganon back to life.<ref name="manual" />

Ultimately, Link restores the crystals to the six palaces and enters the Great Palace. After venturing deep inside, Link battles the last of the guardians, a flying creature known as Thunderbird. Afterwards, his true heart is tested by fighting his own shadow (aka [[doppelgänger]] Dark Link).<ref name="manual" /> Link then claims the Triforce of Courage and returns to Zelda. The three triangles unite into the Triforce, and Link's wish awakens Zelda.<ref name="game" />

''The Adventure of Link'' was originally released on the Japan-only [[Family Computer Disk System]] (FDS) before its worldwide release. During 1988, a [[Chip shortage|shortage of ROM chips]] prevented Nintendo from releasing games according to their original schedules. The delayed products included ''The Adventure of Link'',<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Adventure of Link Delayed Again |magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]] |date=February 1988 |volume=6 |issue=11 |page=1 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/newsletters/video_game_update/computer_entertainer_feb88.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Lazzareschi | first = Carla | author-link = | title = High-Tech Crisis Forces Publishers to Make Tough Choices: Shortage of Memory Chips Hurting Video Game Makers | newspaper = LA Times | date = May 26, 1988 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-26/business/fi-5306_1_chip-shortage | access-date = May 1, 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306035530/http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-26/business/fi-5306_1_chip-shortage | archive-date = March 6, 2016}}</ref> while the company was preparing to release ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' for the Western audience and decided to delay ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' to 1990 shortly after its release. Like the first ''Zelda'' game, the FDS version appears to be an earlier version of the game, with a few obvious differences. In the FDS version the dungeons are all gray or green, whereas in the English cartridge release, each dungeon has a unique color. The two dungeon bosses Carrok and Volvagia (the latter being named Barba in the NES release) have different graphical appearances.<ref>{{cite web|last=Romero|first=Josh|date=September 10, 2006|title=NES Review: Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.

There are some slight additions and differences in the dungeons. Due to the Disk System's additional sound chip, the NES conversion lost some musical elements, especially from the title screen. On the main map, the icons denoting attacking monsters look different. The most significant change is the spending of [[experience point]]s, as Link's three attributes cost the same, unlike the worldwide release. Leveling up is very different on the FDS version, as the saved game on the disk will only let the attributes levels go as high as whatever is set the lowest - for example, if Life is at 5, Strength is at 4, and Magic is at 1, then it will save all as level 1.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 6, 2008|url=http://news.spong.com/article/7085|title=New Famicom Mini Series to see legendary Disc System titles reborn|publisher=Spong|date=July 6, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032146/http://news.spong.com/article/7085|archive-date=April 21, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The RPG mechanics were influenced by ''[[Dragon Quest (video game)|Dragon Quest]]'' (1986), while the combat system was influenced by the [[beat 'em up]] title ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' (1984).<ref>{{cite web |last1=McWhertor |first1=Michael |title=Zelda 2 was Nintendo at its best: unpredictable |url=https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23600112/zelda-2-adventure-of-link-nes-tears-of-the-kingdom |website=Polygon |access-date=24 June 2024 |date=16 February 2023}}</ref>

The intro text was changed to read "third Triforce" rather than "No.3 Triforce" and the copyright date was altered to read "1987–2004 Nintendo". The death animation removed flashing colors in an effort to prevent [[seizure]]s, replacing it with a solid red color.

===Original version===
Upon its release in North America, ''Zelda II'' was met with mostly positive reviews from critics and became one of the most popular NES games of 1988, with many retailers reporting that the game was selling out that year.<ref>{{citation|title=Tracking The Elusive Nintendos|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Dennis Lynch|date=March 31, 1989|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-03-31/entertainment/8903310356_1_game-cartridges-nintendo-mania-zelda-ii|access-date=January 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921161647/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-03-31/entertainment/8903310356_1_game-cartridges-nintendo-mania-zelda-ii|archive-date=September 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The game ultimately sold 4.38 million copies worldwide.<ref>

In 1987, ''[[Famitsu|Famicom Tsūshin]]'' (now ''Famitsu'') gave it a score of 36 out of 40, based on a panel of four reviewers giving it ratings of 8, 10, 9, and 9 out of 10. This made it their second highest-rated game of 1987, behind only ''[[Dragon Quest II]]''.

In 1997, ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' listed ''Zelda II'' as number 72 on its "100 Best Games of All Time", saying that while the other three extant games in the series were better (''The Legend of Zelda'', ''A Link to the Past'', and ''Link's Awakening'' all placed within the top 30), it was still a masterpiece, featuring outstanding gameplay and a much larger quest than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=100 Best Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=114}} Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.</ref> ''Zelda II'' was rated the 110th [[List of video games considered the best|best game]] made on a Nintendo system in ''[[Nintendo Power]]''{{'}}s Top 200 Games list.<ref name="NP Top 200">{{Cite magazine|date=February 2006| title=NP Top 200|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|volume=200|pages=58–66}}</ref> In August 2008, ''Nintendo Power'' listed it as the 12th best [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] video game, describing it as a radical and refreshing departure from its predecessor.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=August 2008 |title=Nintendo Power - The 20th Anniversary Issue! |volume=231 |magazine= [[Nintendo Power]] |issue=231 |page=71 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[San Francisco, California]]}}</ref>

===Re-releases===
''[[IGN]]'' said that the game is a "recommended and playable adventure" but also noted that players should not expect the same gameplay from the classic Zelda titles.<ref name="ign review">{{cite web|access-date=April 1, 2008|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/560/560627p1.html|title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|website=IGN|date=October 26, 2004|author=Harris, Craig|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320074126/http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/560/560627p1.html|archive-date=March 20, 2008}}</ref> ''[[1UP.com]]'' praised the game's length, saying that the players can find plenty to keep them busy for some time.<ref name="1up review">{{cite web|access-date=April 1, 2008|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3136133&did=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204063254/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3136133&did=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 4, 2004|title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (Classic NES Series) (Game Boy Advance) |website=[[1UP.com]]|author=Parish, Jeremy}}</ref> ''[[Kotaku]]'' enjoyed the darker spin on the original ''Zelda'', stating that the more detailed graphics and bigger sprites made enemies appear more menacing and hostile, also noting that an evolved combat system makes enemies able to defend themselves, withdraw, or strike strategically, using the environment to their advantage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/zelda-s-black-sheep-is-my-favorite-in-the-series-1832450235|title=Zelda's 'Black Sheep' Is My Favorite In The Series|last=Tieryas|first=Peter|website=Kotaku|date=February 9, 2019 |language=en-US|access-date=June 8, 2019}}</ref> The game also received some criticism. In a 2007 retrospective, ''[[GameSpot]]'' said that while the game is "decent enough to make it worth the $5 price [on the Wii's Virtual Console]", it features "questionable design decision[s]" and can get confusing if players don't have the help of [[Strategy guide|walkthroughs]].<ref name="gamespot review">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link-review/1900-6172040/|title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|author=Alex Navarro|author-link=Alex Navarro|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 5, 2007|access-date=April 6, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015190635/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link-review/1900-6172040/|archive-date=October 15, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The GBA version of the game has an aggregated score of 73 on [[Metacritic]],<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web|access-date=April 1, 2008|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/gba/zelda2theadventureoflinkclassicnesseries?q=zelda%20ii|title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (Classic NES Series)|website=[[Metacritic]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421084157/http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/gba/zelda2theadventureoflinkclassicnesseries?q=zelda%20ii|archive-date=April 21, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> which is the lowest score of the ''Zelda'' series.

==Legacy==
The game introduced or expanded many enduring elements of the ''Zelda'' series. For example, a greater variety of [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) have more pivotal roles in Link's quests.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 6, 2008|url=http://www.ign.com/blogs/hyrule-times/2006/04/14/retrospective-zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link|title=Retrospective: Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|website=IGN|date=April 14, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829010222/http://www.ign.com/blogs/hyrule-times/2006/04/14/retrospective-zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link|archive-date=August 29, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Zelda II'' is one of the first games with NPCs traveling with their own agendas, giving the world a life of its own rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1788/the_gamasutra_quantum_leap_awards_.php?page=3|title=The Gamasutra Quantum Leap Awards: Storytelling (Page 3)|website=[[Gamasutra]]|date=November 3, 2006|access-date=January 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218043551/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1788/the_gamasutra_quantum_leap_awards_.php?page=3|archive-date=December 18, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The use of metered [[magic (gaming)|magic]] and spells has also carried over into other ''Zelda'' games. The [[Triforce|Triforce of Courage]] is introduced in ''The Adventure of Link'' with an important role in later ''Zelda'' games, as it is strongly associated with Link. [[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Dark Link|Dark Link]] is a version of Link's Shadow that appears in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'', a similar Link clone called Shadow Link appears in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures|Four Swords Adventures]]'', and yet another appears in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks|Spirit Tracks]]'', as well as in ''A Link Between Worlds''.<ref>{{cite news|access-date=April 1, 2008|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60392684|title=Mega Mirror: Help your elf|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=February 6, 1999}}</ref>

''The Adventure of Link'' is one of the first games to significantly combine [[role-playing video game]] and [[platform game|platforming]] elements.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 6, 2008|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/793/793966p1.html|title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Review|website=IGN|date=June 4, 2007|author=Thomas, Lucas M.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516211348/http://wii.ign.com/articles/793/793966p1.html|archive-date=May 16, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Over the next few years, a number of Japanese-made games appeared with a similar format; major games such as ''[[Cadash]]'' (1989) closely resemble ''The Adventure of Link'', with side-scrolling platform stages supplemented by RPG-like statistical systems, weapons, armor, and magic spells.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Five of the sages in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' bear the same names as towns from ''The Adventure of Link'' (Rauru, Ruto, Saria, Nabooru, and Darunia; excluding Impa). The town of Mido shares the name of a character in Kokiri Forest. In the in-game chronology, the towns were named after the characters. ''The Adventure of Link'' is the only ''Zelda'' game of the main English releases not to use "''The Legend of Zelda''" in its title, the only ''Zelda'' game to feature cumulative lives and therefore the only game in the series to include [[Life (video games)#Extra lives|1-up]] dolls.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 1, 2008|url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=7148|title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|publisher=Gaming Target|date=June 28, 2007|author=Scalzo, John|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430124437/http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=7148|archive-date=April 30, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The subsequent ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in 1991 follows new Link and Zelda characters and returns to the top-down style of the original.

There are a small number of side-scrolling areas in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|Link's Awakening]]'', mainly tunnels and caves. The series left the top-down style again in 1998 with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' for [[Nintendo 64]], with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 1, 2008|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/757/757573p1.html|title=The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past VC Review|website=IGN|date=January 22, 2007|author=Thomas, Lucas M.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217111537/http://wii.ign.com/articles/757/757573p1.html|archive-date=February 17, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> A new version of the composition "Temple", arranged by Shogo Sakai, is featured in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', where it is played during the "Hyrule Temple" stage and the "Underground Maze" level. A variation of the track, as well as a new version of the "Great Palace" level song, also appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. The track was later once again updated and appeared twice, as the "[[StreetPass]] Battle Theme" as well as a slower version for the "Battle Victory" music, in the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds|A Link Between Worlds]]''. The StreetPass battle mode is itself inspired by the final boss fight of ''Zelda II''; StreetPass fights occur between one player as Link and the other player as Shadow/Dark Link. The Famicom Disk System version of the composition "Battle Theme" was reused as the "Miniboss Theme" in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap|The Minish Cap]]''.

''Zelda II'' was very influential to other NES games like ''[[Faxanadu]]'', ''[[Moon Crystal]]'', and ''[[The Battle of Olympus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/hidden-gems-rest-nes?pager.offset=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305041207/http://www.1up.com/features/hidden-gems-rest-nes?pager.offset=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 5, 2016|title=Hidden Gems: The Rest of the NES|date=March 5, 2016|access-date=August 21, 2018}}</ref> Some recent games that take more direct inspiration from ''Zelda II'' include ''[[Adventure Time: Hey Ice King!
