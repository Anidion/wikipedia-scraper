'''''Crystal Quest''''' is an [[action game]] written by [[Patrick Buckland]] for the [[Macintosh]] and published by [[Casady & Greene]] in 1987. It was ported to the [[Apple IIGS]] in 1989 by [[Rebecca Heineman]]. Ports were also made to the [[Amiga]], [[Game Boy]], [[iOS]], and [[Palm OS|Palm]].  It was the first game to support the color displays of the [[Macintosh II]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The game was based on the original [[shareware]] game ''Crystal Raider'', one of the supporters of which had been Michael Greene, founder of Greene, Inc. (later to merge with CasadyWare to become [[Casady & Greene]]).  A sequel, similar to the original game, ''[[Crystal Crazy]]'', was released in 1993.

On February 7, 2006 ''Crystal Quest'' was released on [[Xbox 360]] via [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and in 2008 for iPhone and iPod touch.<ref>[https://www.mactech.com/2008/11/13/crystal-quest-game-available-for-iphone-ipod-touch/ Crystal Quest game available for iPhone, iPod touch] from MacTech Magazine</ref>

Game Mechanics LLC licensed ''Crystal Quest'' and launched a Kickstarter to raise money to create a new version in February 2015. Although the Kickstarter was unsuccessful, ''Crystal Quest'' was released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] on November 23, 2016.

==Development==
''Crystal Quest'' is easier to play in color mode on the Macintosh version as opposed to [[monochrome]], as more RAM is used, causing enemies to move slower.<ref name=macworld /> Improvements and features in ''Crystal Quest'' over its predecessor ''Crystal Raider'' include a two-player mode, support for color, improved sound, and a demo mode.<ref name=macworld /> A glitch in the demo mode for early copies of ''Crystal Quest'' caused [[Fatal system error|system errors]] on one out of ten Mac IIs, and those affected could call Greene Inc. for a replacement copy of the game.<ref name=macworld />

==Reception==
''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''Crystal Quest'', praising its action gameplay and colorful graphics, stating that ''Crystal Quest'' is "Fast, challenging action ... You learn to play in minutes because the game is so intuitive ... ''Crystal Quest'' is especially fun to play on a color Mac II because the vivid color-cycle graphics rival those of the finest arcade games. ... ''Crystal Quest'' is the first Macintosh game I've found that truly compares in features and quality with a real arcade game." ''Macworld'' also praises the "clever" sound effects, stating that "some of the sounds are droll, and some are gross. Kids will love them." but criticizes one particular sound effect, saying that "The sound that accompanies the player's entrance into the gateway at the end of each wave, however, is a digitized pseudo-female-orgasmic gasp that several women I played it for found offensive."<ref name=macworld>{{cite magazine|last = O'Meara|first = Felicity|title = A Colorful Quest: Crystal Quest 1.0 Review|date = April 1988|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_8804_April_1988/page/n193|magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|pages = 193â€“194}}</ref>
