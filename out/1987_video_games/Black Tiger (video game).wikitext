'''''Black Tiger''''', known in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''''Black Dragon'''''|ブラックドラゴン|Burakku Doragon|lead=yes}}, is a [[hack-and-slash]] [[platform game]] released for [[arcade video game|arcades]] by [[Capcom]] in 1987.

==Plot==
The land is under the cruel control of three evil demonic dragons, who descended on a kingdom to bring darkness and destruction. From the ruins emerged a barbarian hero, who seeks to slay the dragons and restore the kingdom to its former glory.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Black Tiger.png|thumb|Gameplay screenshot]]
The game is presented in a [[side-scrolling]] format, with eight-way [[scrolling]] (like ''[[Bionic Commando (1987 video game)|Bionic Commando]]'').<ref name="TGM19">{{cite magazine |title=Capcom: A Captive Audience |magazine=[[The Games Machine]] |date=18 May 1989 |issue=19 (June 1989) |pages=24–5 |url=https://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-19/page/n23/mode/2up}}</ref> The player controls the barbarian hero to navigate through eight levels infested with enemies and destroying the levels bosses. The player can find a number of "wise men" who give rewards when rescued. Though the wise man rewards often consist of self-evident "advice", most come in the form of "Zenny coins", [[currency]] that allows the player to buy various items, such as an upgrade to their weapons and [[armour]], [[lock and key|keys]] for [[treasure]] chests, and anti-poisoning potions. Hidden special items that reveal [[coin]]s, grant upgraded armour, full vitality, extra lives, extra time, or simply bonus points may be found by attacking certain walls. The player's vitality bar will also increase up to four times as a reward for reaching score benchmarks. The player can also find hidden dungeons in the level for extra points and items.

The Japanese version has a few changes that makes it more challenging than its American counterpart:
* Several of the "falling rock" obstacles are added.
* The prices of many items are higher.
* More points are needed to increase maximum vitality.
* It is not possible to avoid taking damage from bosses by crouching under them.
