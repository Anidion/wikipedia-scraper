'''''Accolade's Comics''''' (or '''''Accolade Comics''''' in the game) is an [[adventure game]] released in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]]. Published by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] and developed by [[Distinctive Software]], the game intersperses arcade-style games into its plot.

==Production history==
This game was created by the co-founders of the Canadian firm Distinctive Software, [[Don Mattrick]] and [[Jeff Sember]], who sold it to Accolade.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.filfre.net/2015/06/accolade-gets-distinctive/ | title =Accolade Gets Distinctive | last =Maher | first =Jimmy | date =2015-06-25 | website =The Digital Antiquarian | access-date =2020-01-24}}</ref>  

==Game play==
The protagonist of the game is wisecracking secret agent Steve Keene. In the first scene, Keene is summoned to headquarters by his chief, who sends him on one of two missions.<ref name=compute /> 

Game play involves multiple adventures in two arenas: panels of a comic book page where dialogue and actions are selected for Steve that may or may not determine what will happen on the next panel (similar to the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] book format); and traditional scrolling action boards where Steve is a moving character doing the physical task necessary (e.g. swimming, jumping, shooting) to advance through the stage.<ref name=cgw /> 

Steve can lose a life inside the comic page portions as well as the motion portions. If this happens, the game "rewinds" a few panels, forcing the player to re-do these panels until the crisis point is reached again.<ref name=compute />

==Reception==
In the June 1987 edition of ''Questbusters'', Shay Addams admired the "dynamic artwork" with "sophisticated spot animation" that was  "presented in an inventive manner". But he found the internal arcade mini-games were "way too slow to have any fun." He concluded by calling ''Comics'' "lightweight entertainment that you may want to check out just to see the innovative illustration scheme. But don't plan on completing it unless you love playing rather flimsy videogames.<ref name="QB">{{cite journal | journal=Questbusters | title=Accolade's Interactive Comics | last=Addams | first=Shay | date=June 1987 | volume=4 | issue=6 | pages=3 | url=https://mocagh.org/questbusters/qbustersIV6.pdf}}</ref> 

In the June-July 1987 edition of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', Jasper Sylvester admired the game's satirical tone and writing, but criticized the repetitive arcade sequences.<ref name = "cgw">{{citation | date = June–July 1987 | last = Sylvester | first = Jasper | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Accolade's Comics  | pages = 32–33}}</ref>

In the November 1987 edition of ''[[Compute!]]'', Robert Bixby thought that ''Comics'' represented "the new wave in adventure software [...] brightly lit and humorous, and sophisticated enough to poke fun at itself and its genre." Sylvester noted that the graphics-intensive program required a "a lot of disk swapping", and that load times were slow. He criticized the program for forcing the player to re-do some of the storyline each time the character died. However, these issues were minor, and Bixby concluded "With features that will appeal to children and adults, videogame addicts, and adventure aficionados, ''Comics'' is a winner from beginning to end. Or as close to the end as I was able to get after several days of trying. I'm still trying."<ref name=compute>{{cite journal | last =Bixby | first =Robert | title =Accolade's Comics | journal =Compute! | issue =90 | pages =38 | publisher =[[Small System Services]] | date =November 1987 | url =https://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue90/Reviews_Accolades_Comics.php | access-date = 2020-01-24}}</ref>
