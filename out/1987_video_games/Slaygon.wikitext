Slaygon received generally average critical reception. ''[[The Games Machine]]'' said: "The locations to visit and tasks to perform are very similar throughout Slaygon, so tedium sets in quickly."<ref name="TGM"/> ''Your Amiga'' summarized: "[...] Slaygon looks good and plays well initially but there is no real lasting challenge offered."<ref name="YA"/> ''[[CU Amiga]]'' said the game is "Difficult to get into, unimpressive to play, and exceptionally easy to get bored with."<ref name="CUA"/> ''[[Atari ST User]]'' thought the game "should appeal to a wide range of players who are more impressed with depth of gameplay than with flashy graphics or sophisticated animation."<ref name="ASTU"/> ''[[.info]]'' said: "Slaygon has enough suspense, strategy, and challenge to keep you coming back. If you like hi-tech combat, you'll like Slaygon."<ref name="info"/> ''[[Zzap!64]]'' reviewing ''[[Day of the Viper]]'' (1989), which is made by the same developers, noted it as "an incredibly similar game" to ''Slaygon''.  Further commenting that "Charging £19.95 for a game that's two years old (and doesn't seem to have been updated) is a bit suspect."<ref name="zzap">{{cite magazine |title=Test - Day of the Viper |journal=[[Zzap!64]] |date=April 1990 |issue=60 |pages=22–23 |url=https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-060/page/n21/mode/2up |publisher=[[Newsfield Publications]]}}</ref>
