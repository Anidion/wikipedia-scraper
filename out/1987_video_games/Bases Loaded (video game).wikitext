The game is the first installment of the Bases Loaded series, followed by seven sequels across three generations of consoles. There are three more [[video game]]s in the ''Bases Loaded'' NES series, ''[[Bases Loaded II|Bases Loaded II: Second Season]]'', ''[[Bases Loaded 3]]'' and ''[[Bases Loaded 4]]''. There was also a Game Boy version of ''Bases Loaded''. The series continued onto the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] platform with ''[[Super Bases Loaded]]'', ''[[Super Bases Loaded 2]]'', and ''[[Super Bases Loaded 3]]''. The final entry to the series was ''[[Bases Loaded '96: Double Header]]'', released for the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].

''Bases Loaded'' is also the first in a series of sports games by Jaleco known in Japan as ''Moero!!''. Baseball games were localized in the Western markets as the ''Bases Loaded'' series while the basketball game was localized as ''[[Hoops (1988 video game)|Hoops]]'', the tennis game as ''[[Racket Attack]]'' and the soccer game as ''[[Goal! (video game)|Goal!]]''. Two titles went unlocalized: a baseball game ''[[Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyū]]'' and a judo game ''[[Moero!! Juudou Warriors]]''.

==Gameplay==
The game allows the player to control one of 12 teams in either a single game or a full season. For single games, there is also a two-player option.

''Bases Loaded'' featured a [[television]]-style depiction of the pitcher-batter matchup (previously seen in ''[[Intellivision World Series Baseball]]'' and [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]'s ''[[HardBall!]]''), as well as strong play control and a relatively high degree of realism, which made it one of the most popular baseball games of the early NES.

One unique feature of the game is that the [[pitcher]] can provoke a batter to [[charging the mound|charge the mound]]. Each team has only one batter (usually the team's best hitter) who can be provoked in this manner, however; it is up to the player to discover who it is.

At the time ''Bases Loaded'' was released, few video games were licensed by [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American major league sports]]. Therefore, the league depicted in ''Bases Loaded'' is a fictitious league of twelve teams.<ref name="GameFAQs">{{cite web |url = http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587113-bases-loaded/faqs/30570 |date = October 2007 |last = Sulpher |first = Brian |title = Bases Loaded FAQs &#124; GameFAQs.com |access-date = 2010-09-15 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100624103009/http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587113-bases-loaded/faqs/30570 |archive-date = 2010-06-24 |url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/images/8/84/Moero%21%21_Pro_Yakyuu_-_FC_-_Scoreboard.png |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304123314/http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/images/8/84/Moero!!_Pro_Yakyuu_-_FC_-_Scoreboard.png |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Disembodied catcher's mitt==
One of the trademark images of the Bases Loaded franchise was the disembodied catcher's mitt, also referred to as the "phantom paw", that would catch pitches that were thrown extremely outside. Developer Heep Sop Choi claims it was programmed to show the catcher making some terrific snatches without any bodily movement. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Release ==
A defective chip was found during manufacturing, delaying the Nintendo Entertainment System version's North American release.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Computer Entertainer |title=BASES LOADED Clarification |date=August 1988 |volume=7 |issue=5 |page=11 |issn=0890-2143 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/6d/ComputerEntertainer_US_Vol.7_05.pdf |accessdate=27 February 2021}}</ref>

A port for the [[Atari Jaguar]] was planned to be developed by Jaleco, after being signed by [[Atari Corporation]] to be a [[third-party developer]] for the system, but it was never released.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Halverson|first=Dave|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_06#page/n89/mode/1up|title=Jaguar's Domain|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=2|issue=6|publisher=Shinno Media|date=May 1994|pages=90–92}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_07#page/n146/mode/1up|title=The Game Fan 32Bit System Shoot Out - Who Will Lead Us Into The Next Generation?|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=2|issue=7|publisher=Shinno Media|date=June 1994|pages=146–147}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_059.pdf&page=186|title=ProNews: Jaguar Lecensee Count Grows|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=59|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1994|page=184|access-date=2018-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731213533/https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_059.pdf&page=186|archive-date=2018-07-31|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/1994-06-games-amusement-pleasure-01/page/14/mode/1up | title=1994-06 Games Amusement Pleasure #01 | date=June 1994 }}</ref>

==Sequels==
The game saw three sequels on the NES: ''[[Bases Loaded II: Second Season]]'' (released in 1988 in Japan and 1990 in North America), ''[[Bases Loaded 3]]'', released in 1991, and ''[[Bases Loaded 4]]'', released in 1993. The game also had two arcade sequels: ''Moero!! Pro Yakyū Homerun'', released in 1988, and ''Jitsuryoku!! Pro Yakyū'', released in 1989. Japanese game magazine ''Game Machine'' listed ''Jitsuryoku!! Pro Yakyū'' on their September 1, 1989 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the month; the magazine has listed it in English as ''Bases Loaded''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=363|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 September 1989|page=23|lang=ja}}</ref> ''[[Super Bases Loaded]]'' was released for the SNES in 1991, and saw two sequels: ''[[Super Bases Loaded 2]]'', released in 1994, and ''[[Super Bases Loaded 3]]'', released in 1995. A 32-bit installment was also released: ''[[Bases Loaded '96: Double Header]]'', released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1995.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' compared the game unfavorably to Accolade's ''[[HardBall!]]'', both focusing primarily on the confrontation of pitcher and batter. The review described ''Bases Loaded'''s viewpoint behind the pitcher as making it far too difficult to discern the position of, and subsequently hit, the ball. Other annoyances during gameplay, such as the inability to see where outfielders were before the ball got to them, were contrasted against the game's good graphics and animation.<ref name = "CGW">{{Cite magazine | date = December 1988  | last = Kunkel | first = Bill | magazine = Computer Gaming World | title = Video Gaming World: Batter Up! | pages = 64–65 }}</ref>
