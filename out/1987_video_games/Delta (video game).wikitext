'''''Delta''''' is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] released for the [[Commodore 64]] by [[Thalamus Ltd]] in 1987. It was programmed by Stavros Fasoulas and the music was written by [[Rob Hubbard]].  The game was published  as '''''Delta Patrol''''' in the United States by [[Electronic Arts]], for its Amazing Software line, in 1987 on the [[Commodore 64]].<ref name="Dragon128"/> It was also released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1990 as '''''Delta Charge'''''.

The menu-music is based on the theme of [[Koyaanisqatsi]] by [[Philip Glass]] and the in-game-music is based on [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[On the Run (instrumental)|On the Run]]".

==Plot==
''Delta'' is a game in which the [[player character]] is a member of the Delta Patrol, an elite squadron of police in the Delta Sector, and has command of a battle cruiser. The dangers of the Delta Sector include lost ships and alien bandits among other unknown destructive forces, and the character must terminate the alien enemy forces that use these hazards to hide. Destroying an entire wave of enemies earns credits that the player may use to purchase weapons and ship modifications.<ref name="Dragon128"/>

==Gameplay==
The player controls a spaceship and gains [[power-up]] points by destroying formations of enemies. Some enemy formations instead subtract power-up points for the player, so the player must take note of which formations to destroy. Periodically blocks containing the power-ups (higher speed, faster rate of fire) appear and the player can pick one of them up: The more points the player has collected, the more powerful are the power-ups that can be chosen. Unavailable power-ups are gray and kill the player if he flies into them, making them part of the obstacles in the game. The effects of the power-ups are lost over time and must therefore be regained. The player gets a choice between in-game [[music]] or in-game [[sound effect]]s. There is also a [[high score]] table but no way to save it when the game is turned off.

==Reception==
Delta Patrol was reviewed in 1987 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #128 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon128">{{cite journal
