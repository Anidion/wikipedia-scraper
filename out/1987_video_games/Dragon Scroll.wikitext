The game is non-linear and operates almost like a [[sandbox game]]. Many video games helped to influence this video game, including ''[[The Legend of Zelda (1986 video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''.<ref name="videogameden">[http://www.videogameden.com/fc.htm?dra Overview of ''Dragon Scroll''] at Video Game Den</ref> A large video game world helps to define the complexity of the gameplay.<ref name="videogameden"/> However, most puzzles are impossible for non-Japanese speakers to solve,<ref name="videogameden"/> but a [[Fan translation (video gaming)|fan-made translation]] [[fan patch|patch]] has been made available by King Mike Translations in 2008.

==Story==
[[File:DragonScrollNESScreenshot.PNG|200px|left|thumb|The player is fighting one of the minor enemies in this video game.]]

It was an age of [[Magic (gaming)|magic]], in which there existed two factions: Black Mages, who worshipped the three-headed Chrome Dragon, and White Mages, who worshipped the glimmering Gold Dragon. Their conflicts over [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] and [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s brought about countless [[war]]s. The [[God]] Narume knew he must stop the fighting, so he put the Chrome Dragon to sleep in the mountains, and the Gold Dragon to sleep in the desert. He then took magic away from the mages, sealing up the eight Magic Books and hiding them in the sacred desert tower.<ref name="videogameden"/>

Hundreds of years passed after Narume erased magic from the world. The people lived in peace, and villages and towns prospered. However, there were also those who would do wrong to gain wealth. Enter the three greedy [[theft|thieves]]: Safra, Kakai, and Unasu. One day, as they were being chased down for some evil deed, they became lost in the desert. After walking and walking, they stumbled upon the sacred tower and discovered the hidden Magic Books.<ref name="videogameden"/> Thinking they could sell them for a pretty penny, the three split the books amongst themselves and each went his own way. With the Magic Books gone, the Chrome Dragon awoke from its eternal slumber, determined to plunge the world into a second age of dark [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].<ref name="videogameden"/> So Narume infused the Gold Dragon with the spirit of justice, summoning him forth in the form of a [[hero]] named 'Feram'.<ref name="videogameden"/> And so, it is up to Feram to collect the Magic Books and return the Chrome Dragon to its [[sleep|slumber]].

==The Two Dragons==

===Gold Dragon===
The dragon worshipped by White Mages. It likes high places, and lives in a house made of stone. Personality-wise, it is fair, virtuous, and peace-loving. It can take many forms, including those of [[human]]s and [[animal]]s. It also an unnaturally high [[intelligence]] and a vast knowledge of spells. The Gold Dragon has a body length of {{convert|18|m|ft}}, and shoots Flame Breath and Energy Flame from its mouth. It has taken the form of the hero Feram on orders from the God Narume.

===Chrome Dragon===
Worshipped by Black Mages, the Chrome Dragon despises all good beings and loves [[cruelty]]. The ruler of [[Hell]], it has three heads, each with a different attack. One spits flame, the other two spit explosives. Body length of {{convert|40|m|ft}}. The only way to return the Chrome Dragon to its slumber is to pierce its very [[heart]].
