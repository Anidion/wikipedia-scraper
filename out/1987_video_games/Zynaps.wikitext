Zynaps is a [[Euclidean plane|2D]] [[Scrolling]] [[Shooter game]] in which the player's task is to get through 14 levels with a spaceship, shoot waves of hostile attack formations, collect weapons, and not get caught. At the end of each level, after waiting, as is tradition, an end boss awaits that needs to be defeated to progress to the next section. After every section, the difficulty of the next section is increased.

You start with three spaceships and get the first extra ship with 10000 points; after that, you get a new spaceship every 20000 points.

If you lose a life, you automatically get sent back to the beginning of the level, no matter how far you proceed.
