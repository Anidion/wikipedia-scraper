'''''Airborne Ranger''''' is an [[action game]] developed and published by [[MicroProse]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and  [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1987 and the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[IBM PC compatible]]s in 1988. Ports to the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] by Imagitec Design were released in 1989. A sole [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Ranger]] is sent to infiltrate the enemy territory to complete various objectives. The game was followed by ''[[Special Forces (video game)|Special Forces]]'' in 1991.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Airborne_Ranger_Atari_ST_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Ranger found some supplies during an arctic mission (Atari ST).]]
The game consists of several missions, in which the player controls a sole Ranger whose objectives include capturing an enemy officer, destroying an enemy [[bunker]], taking out a [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] site, and rescuing a captured POW, which would possibly free a roster member that was labeled P.O.W. The game creates the maps and objective locations randomly, so the player is required to plan each mission carefully, because no mission is the same.

At the start of each mission, the player is presented with a short overview of the mission, and can select a Ranger from a roster of available soldiers. The player is then in control of an aircraft, described as a [[Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey|V-22 Osprey]] and is allowed to drop three [[ammunition|ammo]] crates over the enemy territory. Once the three containers are dropped, the Ranger is [[parachute]]d into the area. Upon touch-down, the player has to overcome several obstacles, including enemy soldiers and officers, [[land mine|mine fields]], [[Defensive fighting position|foxholes]] and bunkers. Due to limited ammunition, the player needs to plan his path through the territory. The dropped ammo crates provide the soldier with fresh [[hand grenade]]s and ammo. After completing the mission, the Ranger has to navigate to a pick-up point within a time limit. If the Ranger is captured (but not killed), the player can start an optional rescue mission using another soldier from the roster. Each successful mission increases the rank of the individual Ranger, up to [[colonel]].

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' described ''Airborne Ranger'' as "a ''[[Commando (arcade game)|Commando]]'' or ''[[Rambo (1985 video game)|Rambo]]'' with strategy included".<ref name="cgw198711">{{cite magazine | title=Christmas Buyers Guide | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=November 1987 | pages=20 | url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_41/page/n19/mode/2up | issue=41}}</ref> The magazine's reviewer wrote that ''Airborne Ranger'' was reminiscent of ''Commando'' but much deeper and more versatile. He praised the graphics and sound, noting that gunfire sounds different when shot from inside fortifications than it does outside fortifications.<ref name="CGW">{{Cite magazine|date=January 1988|last=Rohrer|first=Kevin|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|title=Airborne Ranger|pages=18}}</ref> The magazine's 1992 survey of computer wargames with modern settings gave the game four and a half stars out of five.<ref name="brooks199206">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date = June 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' noted that ''Airborne Ranger'' was an unusual game for MicroProse's developers given their history of publishing simulations, writing "they have created an arcade game, and a darned good one".<ref name="bobo198805">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_59_1988_May#page/n31/mode/2up | title=Airborne Ranger | work=Compute's Gazette | date = May 1988 | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Bobo, Ervin | pages=31–32}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' stated that "''Airborne Ranger'' is an excellent game from beginning to end", but cautioned that "the violence and action are graphic and highly realistic".<ref name="bixby198805">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_096_1988_May#page/n65/mode/2up | title=Airborne Ranger | work=Compute! | date = May 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Bixby, Robert | pages=65}}</ref>
