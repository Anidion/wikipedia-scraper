== Gameplay ==
Players explore an [[Egypt]]ian town and ruins from a [[first person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game combines role-playing game elements with an [[adventure game]]-like interface. Players may purchase items from shops, though some shopkeepers must be defeated in battle before trading. Battles are [[turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games|turn-based]], with options to fight, use items, or flee. Players accumulate [[experience point]]s by succeeding in battle and "level up" after gaining enough experience, which increases their [[health (gaming)|stamina]]. [[Random encounter|Randomly encountered battles]] with enemies may happen at any time, including when paused to examine the inventory.<ref name="itmedia">{{cite web |url=http://gamez.itmedia.co.jp/games/articles/0606/13/news048.html |title=アドベンチャー＋RPG≒ゲームブック「クレオパトラの魔宝」 |trans-title=Cursed Treasure of Cleopatra: RPG + Adventure = Story-driven game |author=ゲイムマン |date=13 June 2006 |language=Japanese |website=ITmedia Gamez |publisher=ITmedia |accessdate=20 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601150754/http://gamez.itmedia.co.jp/games/articles/0606/13/news048.html |archive-date=1 June 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

''[[Famitsu]]'' appreciated the game's graphics and animations, and called the characters "cute".<ref name="famitsu">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=18356 |title=クレオパトラの魔宝 [ファミコン] |magazine=[[Famitsu]] |access-date=25 July 2015 |language=Japanese |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725120112/http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=18356 |archive-date=25 July 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> ''ITmedia Gamez'' also complimented the game's animations, though felt that too much of the disk's capacity was devoted to these animations at the cost of game length. However, the reviewer thought it was not a bad game, even though it was short, and compared it favorably to ''[[The Warlock of Firetop Mountain]]'', an [[adventure gamebook]].<ref name="itmedia"/>
