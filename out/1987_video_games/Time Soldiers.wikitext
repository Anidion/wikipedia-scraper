'''''Time Soldiers''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Battle Field'''''|バトル フィールド}}, is a 1987 [[run and gun video game]] developed by [[ADK (company)|Alpha Denshi]] for arcades and published by [[SNK]]. It was distributed in North America by [[Romstar]].<ref>[http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10123 ''Time Soldiers''] at the Killer List of Videogames</ref><ref name="Akagi"/> A [[Master System]] version was also produced, as well as versions titled '''''Time Soldier''''' for the [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Atari ST]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Time Soldiers screenshot.png|thumb|left|A player fights enemy soldiers in the World War era. The "D-Scanner" at the top of the screen shows the location of the comrade who must be rescued.]]
''Time Soldiers'' can be played by either a [[single-player]], or by [[multiplayer|two players]] simultaneously. Players move their characters with an eight-way [[rotary switch|rotary]] joystick, shooting enemies along a scrolling backdrop. The rotary joystick allows players to walk in one of eight directions while shooting in any of twelve directions. These controls are similar to the SNK-developed ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' (1986)<ref name="TGM"/> which allowed the player to walk and rotate in eight directions.

The plot involves the protagonists traveling through time to rescue their comrades from the villainous Gylend. Each of the five levels is set in a different time period: The Primitive Age, The Age of Rome, The World Wars, The Age of War and Future World.<ref name=TGM /> Players travel between the periods with the aid of a device called the "D-Scanner". Before each level, the player is shown the name of one of their comrades and the period in which that comrade is held captive. The player is then placed into one of the time periods. If that period is not the one in which the captive soldier is located, the player must defeat a midboss of the level and re-enter the time portal, repeating the process until the correct time period is reached. When the player reaches the correct time period, the player must then fight through the end of the level and defeat the level [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] to rescue the captured soldier.<ref name=Semrad>Semrad, Ed. "Time Soldiers will Test the Best". The Milwaukee Journal. March 12, 1989. p. 4G.</ref> Unlimited [[continue (video gaming)|continues]] are available on all levels except the last one.<ref name=TGM /> In the Sega Master System port however, continues are limited to three continues per player.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Time Soldiers'' on their November 15, 1987 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=320|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 November 1987|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref> Robin Hogg of ''[[The Games Machine]]'' reviewed the arcade game, praising it for its rich graphics and difficulty curve, while comparing it favorably to ''Ikari Warriors''.<ref name="TGM">{{cite magazine |last1=Hogg |first1=Robin |title=Coin-Op Confrontation |magazine=[[The Games Machine]] |date=21 January 1988 |issue=3 (February 1988) |pages=116–8 |url=https://www.solvalou.com/arcade/reviews/20/364}}</ref> Duncan Evans of ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' reviewed the Master System port, rating it 89% and considering it one of the better Master System titles, while comparing it favorably to ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'' (1985) and preferring it over the Master System versions of ''[[Golvellius]]'' and ''[[Altered Beast]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Evans |first1=Duncan |title=Games |magazine=[[Popular Computing Weekly]] |date=3 August 1989 |page=15 |url=https://archive.org/details/popular-computing-weekly-1989-08-03/page/n14/mode/1up}}</ref>
