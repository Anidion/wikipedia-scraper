The video game series based on the game show '''''[[Family Feud]]''''' began with ShareData's 1987 release on the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]] consoles.  In 1990 [[GameTek]] released a version on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]. GameTek later released four more ''Feud'' games for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], and PC between 1993 and 1995. [[Hasbro Interactive]], Global Star, and [[Ubisoft]] have also released versions starting in 2000.

==ShareData versions==
ShareData released the first video game versions of the game show in 1987 on the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Family_Feud_1987|title=Family Feud by Softie, Inc.|year=1987|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}</ref> with two versions of the packaging: one shows a drawing of a just completed round (using the Milton Bradley home game art design), and another shows a full shot of the set from the first Richard Dawson era. The game plays like the Dawson era (with the look similar to the 1976 - 1985 era) with (2 Single rounds, 1 Double Round, and 1 Triple Round - with 300 point rules and Fast Money Win of $10,000)

Later in 1989, ShareData released "The All New Family Feud" on PC, Apple, C64 with rules, gameplay and look based on the Ray Combs era.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/all-new-family-feud|title = The All New Family Feud for DOS (1989)}}</ref>

===NES===
In the NES version of ''Family Feud'', the game tried to recreate the look and feel from the original [[Richard Dawson]]-hosted series, even going as far as to include a Dawson-like host who kissed the female characters in the game. (This differed from the game's packaging, which used the set from the Ray Combs era.) One or two players could play.

Just like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round.

A player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similes to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.

Once a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.

If a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of "Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today". Excuses used include "tax considerations" and "a birth in the family". This is a carry-over from the ShareData versions of the game.

===SNES/Genesis and 3DO/PC===
The versions that followed used the Combs set, with the SNES and Genesis version using a host resembling Combs and the 3DO and PC versions featuring a host resembling Dawson (as he had returned to the series by this point).

The later versions also added options to where a player could play a game without facing an opponent and whether or not they wanted to play the Bullseye Round, which had been added to the show in 1992 and was included in each of the later releases. The Bullseye Round was played as it was during the last two seasons of the Combs ''Feud'', where a $5,000 starting bank was used and up to $15,000 could be added depending on how many questions a team answered correctly.

The later version games played for points instead of dollars, with 300 winning the game. After a win, a player received a code to use if they wanted to stop playing but pick up where they left off. Five wins meant automatic retirement regardless of how much money a player won.

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the 3DO version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that "It's a blast if you have a bunch of folks with whom to play, however, in the final analysis, whether or not you like it probably depends on whether or not you like the television show."<ref name="NG">{{cite magazine|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=88}}</ref>

In 2000, ''Family Feud'' was released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] by [[Hasbro Interactive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/family-feud-951952/pc-14268|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031063653/http://www.ign.com/games/family-feud-951952/pc-14268|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 31, 2012|title=Family Feud [2000] Review|website=IGN|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref> [[Louie Anderson]], who was the host at the time, is the host of the game, appearing as a [[Full-motion video]] character. The game focuses on reliving the same aspect of the game show, in order to provide a better experience. The IBM PC version also features the ability to upload portraits of one's face, and placed in a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] [[animated]] body. This brought the whole experience closer, and it is often considered to be a good feature of the game.

The PC version would later be released in the United Kingdom in 2001 under the show's UK name '''Family Fortunes'''. The only differences between both is that Family Feud host Louie Anderson is replaced with then-Family Fortunes host [[Les Dennis]], and the graphics have been changed to resemble the Family Fortunes set used at the time of the game's release.

Other sets that can be unlocked are the original 1976–85, 1988–94, 1994–95, and 1999–2002.  Well-known game show host [[Todd Newton]] does the voiceover in addition to hosting the game.

In 2009, [[Ubisoft]] released ''Family Feud 2010 Edition'' for the [[Wii]], [[Nintendo DS]], and [[Personal computer|PC]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Feud: 2010 Edition|url=http://www.ign.com/games/family-feud-2010-edition/iphone-14353417|website=IGN|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}</ref> The game uses the 2009 set and features customizable family avatars plus a predictive text input tool for faster answers. In a unique twist, the Wii version requires players to swing the Wii Remote down to hit the buzzer during Face-Offs. The game uses four-member families (much like the 1994–1995 season) as opposed to the usual five; like Ubisoft's ''Price Is Right'' video game, there is no host featured &ndash; all voiceover work is done by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terence McGovern]].

In 2010, Ubisoft released ''Family Feud Decades'' for the Wii. The game uses sets and survey questions from the past four decades, using the 1976, 1988, 1999, and 2009 sets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Feud Decades (2010)|url=http://www.ign.com/games/family-feud-decades/wii-83040|website=IGN|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}</ref> Family Feud 2012 was released in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/family-feud-2012-edition/xbox-360-117315|title=Family Feud: 2012 Edition|website=IGN|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref> In 2020, [[Ubisoft]] published a game simply called ''Family Feud'', made by independent game studio, [[Snap Finger Click]], for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X/S]], [[Nintendo Switch]], and [[Google Stadia|Stadia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Feud Out November 12|url=https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/NegRQw8aZdS3zaWn9jmse/family-feud-out-november-12|website=news.ubisoft.com|accessdate=November 20, 2020}}</ref>
