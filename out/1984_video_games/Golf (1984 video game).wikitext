{{nihongo foot|'''''Golf'''''|ゴルフ|Gorufu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[List of golf video games|golf-based]] [[sports simulation]] [[video game]] developed and released by [[Nintendo]] in 1984 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in Japan. Later the same year, it was ported to the [[Nintendo VS. System]] as '''VS. Golf''' or '''Stroke and Match Golf''', released in [[Arcade game|arcades]] internationally,<ref name="CG8"/> followed by another arcade version called '''VS. Ladies Golf'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=With the VS.

''Golf'' was the [[List of best-selling Nintendo Entertainment System video games|best-selling sports game]] on the NES/Famicom, and was re-released across many years for different Nintendo consoles. It was hidden in the [[Nintendo Switch]] firmware as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] as a tribute to the game's programmer, the late [[Satoru Iwata]].

== Gameplay ==
The main player wears a white shirt and shoes with blue pants and uses a white ball, while the second player wears a red shirt and shoes with black pants and uses a red ball. The player selects either single [[stroke play]] or the two-player selections of doubles stroke play or [[match play]]. The player is then placed at the tee of the first of 18 holes.

In 1991, Nintendo identified the golfer as [[Mario]] in a gameplay guide book.<ref name="Mario Mania">{{cite book | title=Mario Mania: Nintendo Player's Guide | publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] | date=1991 | location=Redmond, WA | oclc=299240250 | page=9}}</ref> Nintendo's [[Wii]] game ''[[Captain Rainbow]]'' identifies the golfer as ''Ossan'',<ref name="Ossan">{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-old-school-nintendo-stars-of-captain-rainbow-5916776|title=The Old-School Nintendo Stars of Captain Rainbow|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|first=Richard|last=Eisenbeis|date=2012-06-08|accessdate=2023-03-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20230305120712/https://kotaku.com/the-old-school-nintendo-stars-of-captain-rainbow-5916776|archivedate=2023-03-05}}</ref> which happens to be one of the generic hero names during the development of ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref name="culmination">{{cite interview | first=Masayuki | last=Uemura | interviewer=Satoru Iwata | title=The Grand Culmination of Famicom Cartridges | publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] | work=Iwata Asks | url=https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/mario25th/1/3 | access-date=March 15, 2021}}</ref> The Game Boy conversion would feature Mario on the Western cover art, but not the Japanese version.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Development and release==
In 1983, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] had only three [[launch games]], and its library would soon total seven, including ''Golf''. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] said he was "directly in charge of the character design and the game design",<ref name="Miyamoto Spills"/> and [[Satoru Iwata]] said he was the only programmer.<ref name="only prog"/>

''Golf'' has been re-released on many other consoles after its release. [[Hudson Soft]] released a conversion of the game for the Japan-only [[PC-8801|PC-88]] and Sharp X1 in 1985.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} ''Golf'' was converted to the Japan-only [[Famicom Disk System|Family Computer Disk System]] on February 21, 1986.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} It was re-released for the [[Nintendo e-Reader]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2002.

''Golf'' can be unlocked in the 2001 video games ''Dōbutsu no Mori'' for [[Nintendo 64]] and ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'' for [[GameCube]]. The latter supports Advance Play using a [[GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable]], allowing ''Golf'' to be played on a Game Boy Advance.

The game is a hidden [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] in the pre-4.0 firmware of the [[Nintendo Switch]], in tribute to Satoru Iwata. Iwata was the sole programmer of ''Golf'' (as one of his first projects for Nintendo) and later became Nintendo's CEO. It can be accessed on the Switch home menu if the system clock is set to the July 11 memorial of Iwata's death, and then the user moves [[Joy-Con]] controllers to imitate the "Direct" hand gesture that Iwata popularized during his tenure as main host of [[Nintendo Direct]] presentations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Orland |first=Kyle |date=September 20, 2017 |title=Hidden Switch game is actually a tribute to former Nintendo president [Updated] |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/searching-for-the-hidden-motion-to-unlock-the-switchs-nes-emulator/ |website=Ars Technica}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=McFerran |first=Damien |date=September 20, 2017 |title=Rumour: Switch's Hidden NES Golf Game Is a Tribute to the Late Satoru Iwata |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/09/rumour_switchs_hidden_nes_golf_game_is_a_tribute_to_the_late_satoru_iwata |website=Nintendo Life}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Good |first=Owen S. |date=July 12, 2015 |title=Nintendo President Satoru Iwata Dies at 55 |url=https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/12/8940053/nintendo-president-satoru-iwata-dies-at-55 |access-date=September 28, 2017 |website=Polygon}}</ref> This version exclusively has the option for [[Motion controller|motion controls]].
