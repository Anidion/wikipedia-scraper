== Release ==
Games & Strategy suggested that in the Loriciels catalog, the game was "only (and wrongly)" cited as a role-playing game.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Excelsior Publications |url=http://archive.org/details/jeux-et-strategie-32 |title=Jeux & stratégie 32 |date=April 1985}}</ref> Microphone anticipated the game's release on MO5 to be successful due to the recent success of its Oric release.<ref>{{Cite book |last=SEDEP s.a. |url=http://archive.org/details/Micro7-24 |title=Micro 7 n° 24 |date=February 1985}}</ref> The game peaked at 30,000 copies sold.<ref name=":0" />

== Critical reception ==
Tilt wrote the game is: "the precursor of a new range of adventure software, which will be more and more realistic, more and more “real”. An undeniable success."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Editions Mondiales S.A. |url=http://archive.org/details/Tilt018 |title=Tilt 018 |date=January 1985}}</ref> Micro 7 gave it a rating of 5 out of 5 stars.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Micro 7, April 1984 |url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=41&num=1265&album=oui |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=www.abandonware-magazines.org |page=117}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
The game has been described as reminiscent of the [[Thomson MO5]] video game [[Thesaurus (video game)|''Thesaurus'']]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Editions Mondiales S.A. |url=http://archive.org/details/Tilt021 |title=Tilt 021 |date=May 1985}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Excelsior Publications |url=http://archive.org/details/jeux-et-strategie-33 |title=Jeux & stratégie 33 |date=June 1985}}</ref> and the [[Oric computers|Oric]] (acquired by Atmos) title [[Le secret du tombeau]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Editions Mondiales S.A. |url=http://archive.org/details/Tilt027 |title=Tilt 027 |date=December 1985}}</ref> Tilt noted that publishers were using "drastic measures to extract the quintessence of the [[Thomson TO7/70]]", citing ''L'Aigle d'Or, Thesarus, and [[Mandragore (video game)|Mandragore]]'' in the adventure and role-playing genres.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Editions Mondiales S.A. |url=http://archive.org/details/Tilt025 |title=Tilt 025 |date=October 1985}}</ref>
