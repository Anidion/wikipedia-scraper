'''''Rescue Raiders''''' is an [[Apple II]] [[scrolling shooter]] published by [[Sir-Tech]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=45wrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=F_wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7024,2083251&dq=rescue+raiders+sir-tech&hl=en|title=New York Computer Software Company Takes Off In Japan|last=Reagan|first=Jim|date=10 October 1985|work=The Telegraph|page=32|accessdate=2 May 2013}}</ref> It was designed by Arthur Britto and Greg Hale.<ref name="giantlist"/>

==Gameplay==
The game is played on a two-dimensional side-scrolling playfield, where two players start at main bases on opposing sides of the field. The player operates a ''[[Choplifter]]''-esque helicopter defending a string of advancing units, which the player purchases throughout the game. The objective is to create and defend a force that can escort a van filled with explosives to the enemy base at the other end of the playing field.

Along the way a series of smaller bunkers act as obstacles by flying balloons which, when operating for the opposing team, will destroy the player helicopter (the cable will severely damage the helicopter). The bunkers may be taken over by delivering enough infantry units, which may reach the bunker either by walking all the way from a main base without being killed, or by being carried there more quickly in the player helicopter.

The helicopter begins with three weapons: heat-seeking missiles, machine guns, and bombs. As the game progresses, additional weaponry is introduced.

==Reception==
In 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' listed it as number 36 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time", citing the strategy required to succeed in the game.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 100 Games of All Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=September 1996|pages=56, 59}}</ref>
