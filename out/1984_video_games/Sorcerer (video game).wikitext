'''''Sorcerer''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] game written by [[Steve Meretzky]] and released by [[Infocom]] in 1984. It is the second game in the [[Magic (game terminology)|magic]]-themed "Enchanter trilogy", preceded by ''[[Enchanter (video game)|Enchanter]]'' and followed by ''[[Spellbreaker]]''. It is Infocom's eleventh game.

==Plot==
Following the unlikely defeat of Krill in ''Enchanter'', the player's character has progressed from an Apprentice Enchanter to earning a coveted seat in the Circle of Enchanters. Belboz the Necromancer, the leader of the Circle, has become not only a [[mentor]] but a close friend as well. Lately, Belboz has seemed different, distracted, even talking to himself at length. Whatever he's dealing with, Belboz doesn't see fit to confide in anyone, then suddenly he disappears.

==Gameplay==
Potions are used by drinking them and each can only be used once. ''Sorcerer'' has 70 ways for the player to die.<ref name="nzt1984spring">{{Cite journal |date=Spring 1984 |title=Infocom Scoreboard |url=http://infodoc.plover.net/nzt/NZT3.2.pdf |journal=The New Zork Times |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=3}}</ref> 

==Release==
The ''Sorcerer'' package includes the following physical items:
*A copy of the fictitious magazine ''Popular Enchanting'' featuring a profile of Belboz
*An "Infotater", a paper [[code wheel]] disguised as information about creatures in the game. The Infotater was found in the original package only. When the game was later re-released in the "gray stripe" box format, the Infotater was replaced by a "Field Guide to the Creatures of Frobozz" brochure containing the same information. Consequently, original Infotaters are highly sought-after by collectors. The Field Guide or Infotater is necessary to open the chest and acquire its contents in the game.

==Reception==
''[[St.Game]]'' stated that "The world of the Sorcerer is rich in detail and wonderment. The magical experiences resemble the exotic adventures of [[Carlos Castaneda]]", with "several diabolical traps and puzzles", and concluded that "The final solution is like a delicate orchid achieving full bloom. Long after the game is over, the heady fragrance stays with you".<ref name="adams19840304">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&pub=6&id=16 | title=Do You Believe in Magic? | work=St.Game | date=Mar–Apr 1984 | accessdate=29 July 2014 | author=Adams, Roe | pages=35}}</ref> ''[[PC Magazine]]'' gave ''Sorcerer'' 10.5 points out of 12.
