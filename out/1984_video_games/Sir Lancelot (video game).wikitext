[[Sir Lancelot]], controlled by the player, must explore the 24<ref name = "inst">{{cite web | url = ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/s/SirLancelot.txt | title = ''Sir Lancelot'' instructions at World of Spectrum| accessdate = 2007-02-26}}</ref> rooms of the castle and collect all the objects (which come in many forms but glow to make them identifiable) in each room before making his way to the exit to the next.<ref name = "inst" /> His task is made more difficult by the presence of various guardians (including animals and soldiers)<ref name = "inst" /> who he must avoid in each room. He also has a time limit in which to complete each room. Control is very simple, with only three keys needed: left, right and jump. A [[joystick]] can also be used.<ref name = "inst" />

The [[ZX Spectrum]] version has the rooms visited progressively whilst the [[Amstrad CPC]] version allows the rooms to be completed in any order. The Amstrad version also has a high-score table which the Spectrum version lacks.
