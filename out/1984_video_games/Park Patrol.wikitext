'''''Park Patrol''''' is a video game designed by Tony Ngo and game published in 1984 by [[Activision]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. It was later released for the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. Players control a park ranger with a choice of a male or female character. The goal is to tidy up rubbish from the waters of the lake and the shoreline.

==Gameplay==
The ranger can walk on the shore or use an inflatable dinghy with an outboard motor to go into the water.

'''Turtles''' kill on contact. If one falls into the water it can be rescued for points but turn into a fast-moving green turtle if left for too long.

'''Snakes''' lurk in the water and can puncture the dinghy. They can be scared away temporarily by dropping snake repellent (at the cost of energy).

'''Swimmers''' can be rescued when calling for help.

'''Ants''' steel food from the hut, which can be recovered by bumping into them from the side (and killed by knocking them into the water).

On the shore is the ranger's hut, which contains food to top up energy. A plant near the hut grows every time the ranger walks into it. When it flowers, the ranger gets a short period of immunity.

By approaching at the right angle, the ranger can jump out of the dinghy and land on floating lots, starting a [[logrolling]] mini-game.

Once all the litter is collected, a bonus is awarded based on energy remaining.
