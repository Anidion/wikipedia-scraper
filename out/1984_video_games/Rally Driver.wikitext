'''''Rally Driver''''' is a [[Sim racing|racing and driving simulation game]] developed by Five Ways Software and published by Hill MacGibbon and [[Alternative Software]]. The game was initially released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984, followed by releases for the [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1986 and the [[Commodore 64]] in 1988.

The game offers a first-person perspective and supports single-player mode.

== Gameplay ==
Rally Driver is a realistic motor [[Rallying|rally]] simulation that challenges players to complete three stages of courses within qualifying times. The game comes with an instruction book and includes a map of the roads for each stage.<ref name="cvg">{{Cite journal |date=February 1985 |title=Rally Driver |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-040/page/n39/mode/1up?view=theater |journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |issue=40 |pages=40}}</ref>

Players must plan their route carefully, considering the different hazards on the roads such as mud, water, and weather conditions that can affect their performance. Longer routes may be necessary to avoid flooded sections, while shortcuts can save time. Learning the course is helpful, but mistakes such as going off-road or crashing result in penalty times.<ref name="aa">{{Cite journal |date=March 1986 |title=Rally Driver |url=https://archive.org/details/amstrad-action-006/page/n61/mode/2up?view=theater |journal=[[Amstrad Action]] |issue=6 |pages=63}}</ref>

The game relies less on reflexes and more on good planning and driving skill. Players must drive through time controls in correct order, stopping to check in and enter a two-letter code displayed on a sign before the control gate to avoid penalties.<ref name="aa" /> Road reports are shown at the bottom of the screen while passing time controls.<ref name="cvg" />

The screen displays the player's view out of the front window, showing the passing scenery of forests, fields, and towns, as well as the road ahead and horizon. The dashboard features a moving steering wheel, a speedometer, a clock for time taken, a hand brake indicator, penalty time, turn indicators, and distance traveled.<ref name="cvg" /><ref name="aa" />

Between stages, a leaderboard shows the player's progress. Completing a stage by getting a top seven time (out of ten computer opponents) qualifies the player for the next,<ref name="aa" /> with each stage being larger and harder than the first.<ref name="cvg" />

[[Computer and Video Games]] reviewers found the game to be an effective and realistic rally driving simulation. Despite the simplistic graphics and sound, they considered graphics and sound adequate and appreciated the strategic aspect of navigation.<ref name="cvg" />

[[Amstrad Action]] reviewers described Rally Driver as an intelligently designed game that successfully simulated the driving skills required in a rally, setting it apart from average driving games. They noted the game's difficulty, particularly in qualifying, and the initially tough controls that become manageable with practice. The graphics were described as "reasonable", with reviewers noting slowdowns at screen updates. Overall, the magazine considered Rally Driver a challenging long-term experience with enjoyable random elements like cows on the road.<ref name="aa" />

In contrast, [[Your Sinclair]] reviewers compared the updated budget release by Alternative to newer games, finding that it did not measure up to them. They suggested that the sparse graphics and jerky animation might not appeal to arcade game fans, but the game could still be appreciated at a lower price by those who enjoy serious simulations.<ref name="ys">{{Cite journal |date=August 1988 |title=Rally Driver |url=https://archive.org/details/your-sinclair-32/page/n35/mode/2up |journal=[[Your Sinclair]] |issue=32 |pages=36}}</ref>
