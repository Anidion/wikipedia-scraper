'''''Xonix''''' is a video game written for [[MS-DOS]] compatible operating systems by [[Israel|Israeli]] programmers Ilan Raab and Dani Katz. It is similar in concept to [[Taito]]'s 1982 arcade video game ''[[Qix]]''. The objective is to fence off sections of a playfield while avoiding bouncing balls.

==Legacy==
''Xonix'' was popular at the [[Dorodnicyn Computing Centre]], where Dmitry Pavlovsky, one of the original developers of ''[[Tetris]]'', was a computer engineer. Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov wrote their own version of ''Xonix'' called ''Antix''.<ref name="vadim">Gerasimov, Vadim. [http://vadim.oversigma.com/Tetris.htm Tetris Story].</ref> It was first developed for the [[Electronika 60]] and then ported to MS-DOS by Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]].

In 2001, [[Russia|Russian]] studio Delico Games released AirXonix, a PC game based on Xonix.
