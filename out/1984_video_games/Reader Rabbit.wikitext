== Design ==
=== Plot and gameplay ===
The series centers on the adventures of Reader Rabbit and his friends, including Sam the Lion and Matilda the Mouse.

Generally, the series consists of point-and-click adventure games where the player must use their inventory and interact with characters to solve a series of puzzles. These puzzles were originally reading-based challenges but different titles focus on other subject areas, such as math and spelling. Visually, the games consists of a series of static screens which the player can navigate through by clicking on certain "travel" hot spots. Other hot spots can trigger an interaction with a character, item, song, or mini-game.

=== Art ===
In the early 1990s, artist Shaowei Liu hand painted backgrounds and animations which were then digitized for the games.<ref>{{Citation |last=Liu |first=Shaowei |title=Shaowei's Artwork |url=http://www.lushgrass.com/learning_games.htm |access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref> In the mid-1990s, artist [[Frank Cirocco]] drew the characters and foregrounds in pencil,<ref>{{Citation |title=Frank Cirocco: Reader Rabbit in the driver's seat |url=http://www.comicartfans.com/gallerypiece.asp?piece=1011249 |access-date=March 9, 2017}}</ref> hiring Mick Gray to ink the line art.<ref>{{Citation |title=About Mick Gray |url=http://mickgray.net/wp/mick-gray-bio/ |access-date=March 9, 2017 |publisher=WordPress.}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=News |url=http://www.geocities.ws/s_ng_99/news.html |website=www.geocities.ws}}</ref> By 1997, the characters were redesigned for ''[[Reader Rabbit Toddler]]'' by Tracy Reynolds of Class 6 Entertainment.<ref>{{Citation |last=Reynolds |first=Tracy |title=Tracy Reynolds' Resume |url=http://tracyreynolds.net/wp-content/uploads/TracyReynoldsResume.pdf |access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> For some of the games at this time, the art was provided by Chester Aldridge's company US Equity Holdings.<ref>{{Citation |title=Management – US Equity Holdings |url=http://www.usequityholdings.com/team/management/chester-aldridge/ |access-date=March 13, 2017}}</ref> For the later games, Fred Dianda was made Lead Artist.<ref>{{Citation |title=Fred Dianda Resume |url=http://freddianda.com/resume/Resume.pdf |access-date=February 5, 2017 |archive-date=June 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624125812/http://freddianda.com/resume/Resume.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref> Some line art was worked on by Gerald Broas, who used a 2B pencil to hand draw the backgrounds and characters on 12 field animation paper.<ref>{{Citation |title=The Art of Gerald Broas |url=https://pixlanim8r.wordpress.com/tag/traditional-animation/ |access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref> For the story books included in the interactive journey and library games, artist Marc Diamond used a [[LeapPad]] tablet to sketch the pictures before coloring and shading.<ref>{{Citation |title=Reader Rabbit Roller Coaster – Sketch and Final |url=http://www.imgrum.net/media/1316486116941463310_3215337592 |access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref> The most recent art for the iOS games was done by concept artist Federico Miniaci.<ref>{{Citation |date=2015 |title=Federico Miniaci Portfolio |url=http://miniaciart.wixsite.com/miniaciart/portfolio |access-date=February 13, 2019}}</ref>

=== Music ===
Each game contains songs that guide the narrative and provide the internal monologs of characters. Composer Scott Lloyd Shelly was particularly proud of composing the music for ''Reader Rabbit: 1st Grade'' in 1998.<ref>{{Citation |title=Interview with Scott Lloyd Shelly |date=November 13, 2013 |url=http://cheerfulghost.com/jdodson/posts/1733/interview-with-terraria-composer-scott-lloyd-shelly |access-date=February 13, 2017}}</ref> Foreign language versions were created for many of the games to give the franchise global appeal. This extended to the games' songs; one song from ''Reader Rabbit Preschool'' was translated into French, German, Portuguese, Russian, and Swedish.<ref>{{Citation |last=ObscureNForeign |title=A Reader Rabbit Song in 6 Languages |date=July 6, 2013 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIqsECJ-ugI |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214100103/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIqsECJ-ugI |access-date=February 13, 2017 |archive-date=February 14, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A [[VHS]] video called ''Reader Rabbit Sing-A-Song Adventures'' was released in 2000, featuring a compilation of the series' best songs.<ref>{{Citation |last=The Learning Company |title=Reader Rabbit Sing-A-Song Adventures |date=January 1, 2000 |url=https://archive.org/details/ReaderRabbitSingASongAdvenures_201302 |publisher=Mattel Interactive |access-date=February 13, 2017}}</ref>

=== Educational goals ===
Education has always been a key part of the games' design, seeking to find a balance between learning and fun. The titles in the series are researched by educators, parents, children and reading specialists to ensure the software is educational, engaging and easy-to-use.<ref>{{Citation |title=New Version of The Learning Company's 'Reader Rabbit 1' Hopping Onto Store Shelves Now – Free Online Library |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/New+Version+of+The+Learning+Company%27s+%27Reader+Rabbit+1%27+Hopping+Onto...-a019018221 |work=thefreelibrary.com |access-date=February 6, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=February 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> The software aimed to promote the use of computers as teaching tools in the classroom.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lopez |first=Ed |title=SOFTWARE SPARKS AN EXPLOSION IN COMPUTER USE |date=December 9, 1991 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/12/09/software-sparks-an-explosion-in-computer-use/7c33da44-293c-43fc-9688-e8015f6a7ba6/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |issn=0190-8286 |access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> The games covered a range of subjects such as reading, phonics, math, and memory.<ref>{{Citation |title=Graffiti Entertainment Offers 'Reader Rabbit Kindergarten'. |date=December 18, 2009 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-214635754.html |work=Entertainment Close-up |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814063531/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-214635754.html |archive-date=August 14, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The A.D.A.P.T.
