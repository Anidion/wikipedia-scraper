'''''Spy vs. Spy''''' is a video game written by Michael Riedel for the [[Commodore 64]] and published by [[First Star Software]] in 1984. A port for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was released simultaneously. It is a two-player, split-screen game, based on ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine's long-running cartoon strip ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]'', about the [[slapstick]] antics of two spies trying to kill each other with improbably elaborate traps and weapons.

It was ported to the [[Apple II]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Acorn Electron]], [[Atari ST]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 16]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Amiga]], [[Master System]], [[Game Boy family|Game Boy]], [[Game Boy Color]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Spy vs Spy A800 ingame.png|left|thumb|White Spy has just found the briefcase (Atari 8-bit)]]
The object of the game is to collect various secret items in a briefcase and exit the building through a door to the airport, either before the opposing player exits or before the timer runs out.  While searching for the items, traps can be laid to take out the opponent (or the player himself, if careless). Each spy has a personal countdown timer which depletes by 30 seconds upon each death.

The arena is an [[embassy]], constructed from a series of interconnected rooms laid out on a grid pattern. Higher levels have more rooms and therefore a larger play area. The spies can engage in hand-to-hand combat (achieved by wiggling the [[joystick]] or [[directional pad]] left and right or up and down when the spies are in proximity to each other) as well as place traps on the furniture and doors which occupy the playing area. These traps are triggered when a spy searches a piece of furniture or opens a booby trapped door, resulting in a cartoon-style animation showing the subject being shot, blown up, etc., and floating up to heaven as an angel.

Strategy is introduced by limiting the numbers of each trap a spy can use and by allowing the traps to be triggered by either spy. Some pieces of furniture also contain 'remedies' which match up to specific traps; these allow a trap to be defused, but can only be fetched one at a time.

== Legacy==
A remake including the original version was released for iOS in 2012, but is no longer available.

Two sequels to the original 1984 game were produced: ''[[Spy vs. Spy II: The Island Caper]]'' and ''[[Spy vs. Spy III: Arctic Antics]]''. The third game was also released for the [[IBM PC]]. These kept the basic gameplay while tweaking some core features.<ref name="farrell">{{cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Andrew|title=''Spy vs Spy II'' Review|journal=The Australian Commodore Review|volume=2|issue=7|page=6|publisher=Saturday Magazine Pty|issn=0816-5874|oclc=217544012}}</ref>
