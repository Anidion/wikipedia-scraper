'''''Questprobe featuring The Hulk''''' is a 1984 [[graphic adventure]] video game developed and published by [[Adventure International]] in collaboration with [[Marvel Comics]]. It is the first entry in ''[[Questprobe]]'', an intended series of graphic adventure games that only released three installments before the developer's bankruptcy. The game's narrative follows the Marvel superhero [[Hulk]] and his human alter-ego Bruce Banner (in their first video game appearance), who must explore the mysterious lair of the [[Chief Examiner]]. The graphics and story outline were created by Marvel artists and writers. Critical reception was generally positive, with much of the praise going to the visuals. Reactions to the gameplay were mixed, especially upon the game's budget re-release, by which time it was considered dated.

==Plot==
Bruce Banner awakens to find himself bound to a chair in a mysterious chamber. He bites his lip to transform into the Hulk and free himself, but gas fills the room and permeates his skin, reverting him back to Banner. He explores his surroundings, which consist of three dome-shaped buildings and a grassy field surrounding them; Banner is able to transform into the Hulk outside of the domes. He happens upon an astral projection of [[Doctor Strange]], who advises remembering [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] and encourages him to "look for Scott's next Marvel Adventure at [his] favorite store" before vanishing. In a cavern, the Hulk encounters [[Ultron]], who has trapped [[Hank Pym|Ant-Man]] in a cage. The Hulk gathers a swarm of [[army ant]]s from the field, allowing Ant-Man to control them, incapacitate Ultron, and free himself. Throughout his exploration, the Hulk amasses a collection of gems. Upon retrieving all of them, the Hulk is approached by the [[Chief Examiner]], who leaves him with the password "Aria".

==Development and release==
In 1983, [[Marvel Comics]] vice president Joseph Calamari, wishing to introduce the brand to home computers, searched for a licensee for use of the company's characters in a home computer game. He personally approached [[Adventure International]] founder and CEO [[Scott Adams (game designer)|Scott Adams]], recognizing him as a leader in the market.<ref name=PowerPlay>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-power-play-13/page/n75/mode/2up |title=Probing ''Questprobe'' |last=Jermaine |first=John |date=March 1985 |magazine=[[Commodore Power/Play]] |publisher=Contemporary Marketing |pages=74–77 |issn=0739-8018}}</ref><ref name=Adventurer>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/the-classic-adventurer/TheClassicAdventurer05/page/n15/mode/2up |title=Great Scott |first=Mark James |last=Hardisty |magazine=The Classic Adventurer |year=2019 |issue=5 |page=30}}</ref> Adams had been an avid reader of Marvel since his childhood, and saw potential in the venture. The negotiations for their contract lasted six months, with the final version being signed on December 1, 1983.<ref name=PowerPlay/> Marvel granted Adventure International a ten-year license for exclusive use of their characters in adventure games. This was Marvel's first long-term license, as most licenses last only one or two years.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/Page_6_Magazine_10/page/18/mode/2up |title=Scott Adams Interview |last=Gould |first=Steve |magazine=[[Page 6]] |issue=10 |date=August 1984 |page=19}}</ref> It was also Adventure's first time using licensed characters, and Adams would reflect fondly in his collaboration with Marvel, considering them one of the friendliest firms he had worked with.<ref name=PowerPlay/>

Adams was given unlimited freedom in creating the ''[[Questprobe]]'' games, though Marvel would maintain the right of final approval, and some ideas would be rejected due to their similarity to upcoming Marvel storylines. Examples of these were the basic plot of ''[[Secret Wars]]'' and the concept of an insane [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]].<ref name=PowerPlay/> To aid in Adams's endeavor, Marvel supplied him with a pre-release copy of the ''Marvel Universe Encyclopedia'', a complete compendium of Marvel characters.<ref name=Adventurer/> The series' title was conceived over a couple of nights in which Adams attempted to formulate a title that would indicate the player's involvement in a search. Adams and Marvel writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] spent an afternoon coordinating a rough overview of the series, and [[Bob Budiansky]] would oversee the entire project. Adams also cited Marvel [[editor-in-chief]] [[Jim Shooter]] as a source of input.<ref name=PowerPlay/> The Hulk was selected as the first ''Questprobe'' game's star because he was recognizable by both comic fans and general audiences, and Adams felt that the character's two forms – one weak and one superhuman – made him an interesting subject for an adventure game.<ref name=PowerPlay/> The title would be the Hulk's first appearance in a video game.<ref name="GameSpotSuperFun">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/17-super-fun-times-the-hulk-showed-up-in-video-gam/2900-135/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424095535/https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/17-super-fun-times-the-hulk-showed-up-in-video-gam/2900-135/ |title=17 Super Fun Times the Hulk Showed Up in Video games |last=Walden |first=Matthew |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=May 4, 2015 |archive-date=April 24, 2017 |access-date=February 2, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>

To attract new players, Adams deliberately designed the game on a beginner's level by simplifying the puzzles, leading Adams to admit that "anybody who has played a lot will finish the game in a day".<ref name="MicroAdventurerReview">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/MicroAdventurer11-Sep84/page/n7/mode/2up |title=Adventure International: ''The Incredible Hulk'' |last=Williams |first=Noel |magazine=Micro Adventurer |publisher=Sunshine Books |issue=11 |date=September 1984 |pages=8–9}}</ref> The Hulk's ability to leap great distances was omitted due to technical limitations, with Adams proposing that the absence of this ability could be attributed to the setting's artificial gravity.<ref name=PowerPlay/> The graphics were adapted by Kem McNair from artwork created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[John Romita Sr.]]<ref name="OpeningCredits">{{cite video game |title=Questprobe featuring The Hulk |developer=[[Adventure International]] |platform=Multiplatform |level=Opening credits |date=May 1, 1984}}</ref> Between 50 and 70 drawings were created for the game, each ranging from 100 to 4,000 bytes in size.<ref name=PowerPlay/> The [[Chief Examiner]]'s appearance was modeled after Adams,<ref name="MicroAdventurerReview"/> and the passwords he gives in each of the ''Questprobe'' games are names of Adams' own children.<ref name="HG101"/> The game is dedicated to Hulk creator [[Stan Lee]], Adams' wife Alexis, and [[CompuServe]] [[CB Simulator]] users.<ref name=PowerPlay/>

The collaboration between Marvel and Adventure was revealed in February 1984 by Adams at the LET International Trade Show in [[London]].<ref name=Adventurer/> ''Questprobe featuring The Hulk'' was released on May 1, 1984, for the [[Acorn Electron]], [[Apple II series]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Dragon 32/64|Dragon 32]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[ZX Spectrum]].<ref name="HG101"/><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/Page_6_Magazine_10/page/18/mode/2up |title=''Questprobe featuring The Hulk'' advertisement |magazine=[[Page 6]] |issue=10 |date=August 1984 |page=18}}</ref> The game was made available in text-only cassette formats and disk formats that include graphics. The game's release was accompanied by a comic similarly titled ''Questprobe'', with the first issue centering on Durgan the Philosopher, who tricks the Hulk into saving his doomed planet.<ref name="RunReview">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/run-magazine-13/page/n15/mode/2up |title=Software Gallery: ''Questprobe: The Hulk'' |last=Jermaine |first=John |magazine=[[Run (magazine)|Run]] |publisher=[[IDG Communications]] |issue=13 |date=January 1985 |page=14}}</ref> According to Adventure International U.K. managing director Mike Woodruffe, many [[wholesaler]]s had no provisions for distributing comics, and so were not able to supply [[retail]]ers with it.

Reception of the original release of ''Questprobe featuring The Hulk'' was generally positive, with the visuals receiving particular acclaim. The White Wizard of ''[[Personal Computer Games]]'' regarded the graphics as excellent, but was also thankful for the option to toggle them off to decrease loading times.<ref name="PCGamesReview"/> Steve Gould of ''[[Page 6]]'', deeming the game "the best Graphic Adventure of any kind that I have seen", commended the size and detail of the visuals as well as the elimination of [[Flicker (screen)|flickering]] in comparison to past graphic adventure titles.<ref name="Page6Review"/> Derek Brewster of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' praised the graphics for their rich detail (singling out the transformations between Banner and the Hulk) and fast loading times.<ref name="CRASHReview"/> Noel Williams of ''Micro Adventurer'' acknowledged the graphics as attractive, but considered them to fall short of those of other software companies. He appreciated the illustrations' stylistic accuracy to the comics as well as the close-up images of the game's collectible items. However, he was annoyed that the transformation from the Hulk to Banner slowed the gameplay's pacing.<ref name="MicroAdventurerReview"/> John Jermaine, writing for ''[[Run (magazine)|Run]]'', was pleased by the accuracy of the visuals to the comics and admired the artistry of the backgrounds.<ref name="RunReview"/> Brewster and Tony Hetherington of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' singled out the transformations between Banner and the Hulk as their favorite images.<ref name="CRASHReview"/><ref name="ComputerGamerReview"/>

The White Wizard, while observing that the game design was primitive, considered it to be "furiously addictive" nonetheless.<ref name="PCGamesReview"/> Gould appreciated the gameplay's "devious moves and hidden dangers" along with the lack of negative consequences for dying.<ref name="Page6Review"/> Brewster criticized the repetitive gameplay, which he said was exacerbated by the identical interiors of the domes.<ref name="CRASHReview"/> Williams regarded the ZX Spectrum version as unfriendly due to its faulty parser, judged the presentation of the screen messages as crude, and was irritated by the game's commercialism, citing the game's tendency to advertise a hint book when "help" is entered.<ref name="MicroAdventurerReview"/> Jermaine liked the concept of gaining and controlling the Hulk's powers, and considered the game to be the best graphic adventure he has played, but was disappointed by the absence of audio.<ref name="RunReview"/> Tom Benford of ''[[Commodore Power/Play]]'' said "if you're an experienced adventure game aficionado, ''The Hulk'' is a must-have. If you're new to this sort of gaming, it will make an excellent entry program into the world of adventure games".<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-power-play-14/page/n19/mode/2up |title=Game Reviews: ''The Hulk'' |last=Benford |first=Tom |magazine=[[Commodore Power/Play]] |publisher=[[Commodore Business Machines]] |issue=14 |date=May 1985 |pages=18–19}}</ref> Brain J. Murphy of ''[[inCider]]'' said: "Based on the fun I've had and the fun yet to come, I recommend you take a look at the Hulk episode of ''Questprobe''".<ref name="inCiderReview"/>

The budget re-release's reception was more mixed. Hetherington acknowledged the high difficulty, but proclaimed ''The Hulk'' to be the best ''Questprobe'' entry due to the character's simple set of powers.<ref name="ComputerGamerReview"/> The White Wizard, writing for ''[[Zzap!64]]'', remarked that the game's design had become antiquated since its original release, citing its two-word input, limited vocabulary, and illogical puzzles.<ref name="Z64Review"/> A reviewer for ''ZX Computing Monthly'' lambasted the game's design and programming as poor, and remarked that the visuals have not aged entirely well. The reviewer added that while a few of the puzzles were fun, they were made harder by the aforementioned faults.<ref name="ZXComputingReview"/>
