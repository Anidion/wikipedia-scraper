==Gameplay==
The player controls the eponymous Pedro, a Mexican gardener, and the object of the game is to protect Pedro's plants from the various animals—such as ants and rats—that try to eat them. To do this Pedro must try to block the entrances to his garden with bricks, stamp on any animals that get in, and plant seeds to replace any plants that are eaten. In addition to this a tramp will break into the garden every now and then and try to steal Pedro's seeds. The game ends when no plants remain. Points are scored by stamping on animals, and a bonus is earned at the end of each [[level (video games)|level]] based on the number of plants remaining.<ref name='PedroInstructionsTxt'>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/p/Pedro.txt |title=Pedro English Instructions |access-date=2017-04-28 |last=Stuart |first=R |work=World of Spectrum }}</ref>
