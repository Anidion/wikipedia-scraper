'''''Flak: The Ultimate Flight Experience''''' is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] designed by Alain Marsily, programmed by Yves Lempereur, and published by Funsoft in 1984.<ref name="atarimania">{{cite web |title=Flak |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-flak_1999.html |website=Atari Mania}}</ref> It was ported to the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] home computers. ''Flak'' was heavily inspired by the 1982 Namco arcade video game ''[[Xevious]]''.  Most critical reviews were middling or harshly negative.

==Gameplay==
The player flies a ship over a vertically scrolling landscape, firing on land bases, on the way to destroy a fortress containing an enemy CPU.

==Reception==
The game received mixed to poor reviews. In ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'', Steve Panak called ''Flak'' "the worst mistake your wallet ever made" and advised readers to "avoid it like radioactive waste",<ref name="analog">{{cite magazine|date=November 1984 |title=A Software Cornucopia |last1=Panak |first1=Steve |url=https://archive.org/details/analog-computing-magazine-24/page/n31/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[ANALOG Computing]] |issue=24 |pages=30–31}}</ref> while ''[[Electronic Games]]'' called it "a challenging game that requires some almost impossibly fine maneuvering".<ref name="eg">{{cite magazine|last=Kohl|first=Louise|date=February 1985|title=Flak|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_03_Number_02_1985-02_Reese_Communications_US/page/n31/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Electronic Games]]|pages=33–34}}</ref> ''[[Your Spectrum]]'' called the game a rip-off of ''[[Xevious]]'', giving it a 0.8/5 and stating that it "should've been drowned at birth."<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=July 1985 |title=Flak |url=https://archive.org/details/your-spectrum-magazine-16/page/n43/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Your Spectrum]] |issue=16 |page=42 |access-date=2021-03-14}}</ref>

''[[Commodore User]]'' was more lenient, giving the game a 3/5 in "value for money" and praising the presentation, though complaining about excessive difficulty, disappointing sound, and long load times.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=November 1984|title=Flak|url=https://archive.org/details/Commodore_User_Magazine_Issue_014/page/50/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Commodore User]]|volume=2|issue=2|page=50|access-date=2021-03-14}}</ref> Writing for ''TV Gamer'', J.P. Thompson praised the Commodore 64 version's "ultra-smooth scrolling" and called it "a truly addictive game". The review, which gave it a 3.5/5, cited the game's difficulty as something that would have players "staying up most of the night attempting to reach [its] penultimate phase".<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Thompson|first=J.P.|date=November 1984|title=Flak|url=https://archive.org/details/TV_Gamer_1984-11_Boytonbrook_GB/page/n41/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=TV Gamer|page=43|access-date=2021-03-14}}</ref> Contrary to other contemporary reviews, ''[[Personal Computer Games]]'' remarked that the Atari 8-bit version is "too easy" and therefore "lacks any truly addictive qualities", giving it a 6/10.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=T.T.|date=September 1984|title=Flak|url=https://archive.org/details/Personal_Computer_Games_Issue10/page/n37/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Personal Computer Games]]|page=37|access-date=2021-03-14}}</ref>
