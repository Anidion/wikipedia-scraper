'''''Toy Bizarre''''' is a [[platform game]] written by Mark Turmell for the [[Commodore 64]] and published by [[Activision]] in 1984.<ref name=retro>{{cite magazine|title=Developer Lookback: Activisionaries|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=25|pages=36, 40}}</ref> A port to the [[ZX Spectrum]] was released in 1985.

== Gameplay ==
Players control Merton, a maintenance man who works at a toy factory, represented by a series of platforms and valves.  During one of his shifts, the toys come to life and rebel.  Merton has to capture all the toys while avoiding a life-sized doll named Hefty Hilda.  Hilda and Merton can freely travel through the factory, jumping on to the various platforms and toggling the valves on or off.  While turned on, the valves create balloons.  If Merton does not pop the balloon in time, it hatches a toy.  Merton can not ordinarily touch the toys or Hilda; doing so causes him to lose one of his five lives.<ref name=pcn/>

Certain special platforms are linked to each other.  If Merton jumps on one of these platforms, any toys on the linked platform are stunned, and he can capture them.  Both Hilda and Merton can be killed through this same process if another character activates a linked platform, though Hilda eventually returns.  The toys can also be stunned and thereafter captured by jumping over them.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lemon64.com/review/toy-bizarre/739 |title= "C64 Review: Toy Bizarre â€” Hilda Noooooo!"|last=Raad |first=Rik |date=November 4, 2007 |website=Lemon 64 |publisher= |access-date= |quote="Jumping over Clockwork toys stuns them so you can then walk into them."}}</ref>  Once all the toys are captured, a new level is loaded.  Higher levels feature more toys and valves.  Bonus levels, called intermissions, allow the player to collect extra lives.<ref name=pcn/>
