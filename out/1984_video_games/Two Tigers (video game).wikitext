'''''Two Tigers''''' is a [[multidirectional shooter]] created by [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]] and released as an [[arcade video game]] in 1984. One or two players each control a [[World War II]]-era [[fighter aircraft|fighter plane]] to shoot enemy planes which fall and damage a [[naval ship]] at the bottom of the screen. After enough damage, the ship explodes. Players can also drop one bomb at a time to the same effect. An alternate [[dogfight]] mode allows two players to attempt to down each other's plane.

The game was released as both a standalone cabinet and as a conversion kit for ''[[Tron (video game)|Tron]]''. The two have different controllers and differ in gameplay and presentation details.

==Gameplay==
Each player steers an always moving plane by rotating it clockwise and counter-clockwise. Enemy planes fly horizontally across the screen; shooting them causes them to crash into the ocean or the large ship floating in it. Each hit from a downed plane destroys a piece of the ship where it crashes. [[Naval mines]] drifting in the water can be shot, damaging the ship from below.<ref name="flyer"/> Players can damage the ship directly by dropping bombs. Only one bomb per player can be in the air at once.<ref name="butler"/>

Destroying an entire vertical column of a ship causes a leak. When enough leaks have been created (based on the level), the ship explodes. As an intermission, submarines, sharks, and swimmers occupy the open water and can be shot. After a brief respite, a new ship arrives.

Lives are unlimited in ''Two Tigers''. Flying into another plane spawns a replacement once the wreckage falls offscreen. Player-controlled planes do not collide with the ship at the bottom. After a certain amount of time an undestroyed ship leaves; three such departures ends the game.

==Release==
There are two variations of ''Two Tigers'' machines. The original, standalone version has a [[Yoke (aeronautics)|flight yoke]] to steer the plane.<ref name="butler"/> Ambient audio is provided by an 8-track tape player in the cabinet.<ref name=klov/> The game was later released as a conversion kit for Midway's ''[[Tron (video game)|Tron]]'' which uses the weighted [[paddle controller|spinner]] to rotate the plane and does not include the 8-track player. It has significant differences in terms of gameplay, visuals, and audio compared to the original.<ref name="ah_conv"/>
