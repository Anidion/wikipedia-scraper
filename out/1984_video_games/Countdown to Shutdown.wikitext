==Reception==
Gregg Williams reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Overall, I like the Apple version of Countdown, and I'm sure the C-64 version is even more enjoyable. If you ever get the game completely solved, you can play a randomized version that will keep you busy for a while longer."<ref name="CGW29">{{cite magazine |last=Williams |first=Gregg |title=Micro-Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Juneâ€“July 1986 |volume=1 |issue=29 |pages=37}}</ref>
