'''''Fahrenheit 451''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] game released in 1984 and based on the 1953 [[Fahrenheit 451|novel of the same name]] by [[Ray Bradbury]]. Originally released by software company Trillium, it was re-released in 1985 under the company's new name [[Telarium]].

The player's goal is to help [[Guy Montag]], the main character from the novel, to evade the authorities and make contact with an underground movement. Bradbury contributed to the game<ref>Ray Bradbury, from the game package blurb: "I'm thrilled to be participating in the evolution of my ''Fahrenheit 451'' into a computer adventure. For anybody curious about what happens to Montag after the book ends, or about what science fiction software might be, here is an exciting place to start."</ref> by writing the prologue and responses of the game's intelligent computer "Ray".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Murphy |first=Jamie |others=Reported by Cristina Garcia |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,968242,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029193209/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968242,00.html |url-status=live |archive-date=2010-10-29 |title=Stepping into the Story: Players participate in 'interactive fiction' |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1985-05-13 |accessdate=October 7, 2021 |volume=125 |number=19 |page=64 |quote=For ''Fahrenheit 451'', Bradbury supplied programmers with more than 100 possible responses to questions that players are able to pose to 'Ray,' an intelligent computer that figures heavily in the story line.}} (the quote is possibly on page 2)</ref>

== Publication history ==
The plot and text of the game were co-written<ref name=":0" /> by Len Neufeld (known for his previous authorship of books in the ''[[Be an Interplanetary Spy]]'' [[interactivity|interactive]] novel series), working under the aegis of [[Byron Preiss Visual Publications]].

The game was released for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Macintosh]], [[MSX]] and [[List of TRS-80 and Tandy-branded computers#PC-compatible computers|Tandy]] computers.

== Plot ==
At the ending of ''Fahrenheit 451'', former Fireman Guy Montag is a fugitive, wanted for murder for killing his supervisor and stealing contraband books. The game takes place five years later. A pointless war has swept across the country, leading to martial law by the Firemen. Now an agent for the literary underground, Montag makes his way to New York. His mission is to break into the heavily guarded [[New York Public Library]] on 42nd Street. The books themselves were burned, but the contents had first been transferred to [[microcassette]]. The microcassettes need to be retrieved and uploaded into the Underground's information network. Along the way, he discovers that Clarisse McClellan, the young woman who inspired him to rebellion, is still alive.

Challenges for the player involve finding ways to alter one's appearance, fingerprints, and "chemindex" (body chemistry) in order to evade detection. Other issues arise in finding food to eat and safe places to rest. The player must also make contact with members of the Underground hiding in the city, through the use of a lighter and literary quotations.

In the end, Montag is able to break into the Central Library and meet up with Clarisse. The microcassettes are found and transmitted on the information network to resistance cells all over the world. While Montag and Clarisse achieve victory in saving the extensive collection of literature, it costs them their lives as firemen storm the office after the last cassette is transmitted, [[Death by burning|immolating]] them both.

== Reception ==
In the 1980s, a reviewer praised the "gripping prose" and the "unique approach of obtaining and using literary quotations".<ref>Gil Merciez: "Fahrenheit 451", ''Antic Amiga Magazine'', Vol. 5 Nr.1, 5/1985, p.81).</ref> German reviewers maintained the complexity of the plot, the graphics and the large number of scenes and non-fictional characters.<ref>Boris Schneider-Johne, Heinrich Lenhardt: ''Science Fiction-Adventures'', ''Happy Computer'' 5/1985, p.145ff {{in lang|de}}</ref>

In 1993, a German study about the history of interactive fiction described ''Fahrenheit 451'' as a highly complex, interactive computer fairy tale.<ref>Werner Faulstich: ''Von Trollen, Zauberern, der Macht und anderen wundersamen Abenteuern. Kleine Einführung in interaktive Computer-Märchen [From trolls, wizards, power and other wondrous adventures. Brief Introduction to interactive computer-tales.]'', ''Zeitschrift für Literaturwissenschaft und Linguistik [Journal for Literature and Linguistics]'', Vol. 92, 1993, p. 96-125 (p. 114) {{in lang|de}}</ref> It referred to the adventure as a play with classic literature quotations.<ref>Werner Faulstich: ''Von Trollen, Zauberern, der Macht und anderen wundersamen Abenteuern. Kleine Einführung in interaktive Computer-Märchen [From trolls, wizards, power and other wondrous adventures. Brief Introduction to interactive computer-tales.]'', ''Zeitschrift für Literaturwissenschaft und Linguistik [Journal for Literature and Linguistics]'', Vol. 92, 1993, p. 96-125 (p. 117) {{in lang|de}}</ref>
