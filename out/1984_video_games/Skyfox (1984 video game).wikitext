'''''Skyfox''''' is a [[combat flight simulation game]] developed by [[Ray Tobey]] for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1984. [[Ariolasoft]] published the game in Europe. It was released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh]] in 1985, to the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] in 1986, and to the [[PC-8800 series|PC-88]] in 1988.

The 1987 sequel, ''[[Skyfox II: The Cygnus Conflict]]'', was developed for the Commodore 64 by [[Dynamix]] without Tobey's involvement.

==Description==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
The player pilots the ''Skyfox'', the most advanced attack [[fighter aircraft|fighter plane]] available to the fictional government, the Federation. The plane has armaments consisting of [[guided missile|radar guided missiles]], [[infrared homing|heat-seeking missiles]], [[laser|laser cannon]]s and deflection shields, and has a top speed of [[Mach number|Mach 4]]. Gameplay consists of finding and destroying enemy [[tank]]s, planes and motherships. The game has 15 scenarios that can be played at five skill levels.

Featuring a view from the [[cockpit]] of the jet, this game is recognized as popularizing this view. The cockpit features radar which shows incoming missiles and other threats. Flying above the clouds, the player fights hordes of enemy planes. Flying below them, the player is attacked by enemy tanks. Hailed upon its release, most criticisms of the game cited repetitive gameplay as the only drawback.

Tobey thought a player could get bored flying an advanced fighter plane and might want to play a game. Consequently, he incorporated a ''[[Space Invaders]]'' game into ''Skyfox'' as a hidden [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] activated by pressing Ctrl-G while flying.

The Apple II version can use a [[Mockingboard]], if one is present, for greatly improved audio.

''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'' rated ''Skyfox'' for the Commodore 64 three-plus stars out of five, praising the graphics but stating that "the gamester finds a much less involving product lying below the surface glitz ...
