'''''F-15 Strike Eagle''''' is an [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15 Strike Eagle]] [[combat flight simulation game]] released for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] in 1984 by [[MicroProse]] then ported to other systems. It is the first in the ''F-15 Strike Eagle'' series followed by ''[[F-15 Strike Eagle II]]'' and ''[[F-15 Strike Eagle III]]''. An arcade version of the game was released simply as ''F-15 Strike Eagle'' in 1991,<ref>{{cite web|title=F-15 Strike Eagle|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7746|website=Killer List of Video Games}}</ref> which uses higher-end hardware than was available in home systems, including the [[TMS34010]] graphics-oriented CPU.

==Gameplay==
[[File:F-15_Strike_Eagle_(video_game)_Atari_8-bit_PAL_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot (Atari 8-bit)]]

The game begins with the player selecting Libya (much like [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]]), the Persian Gulf, or Vietnam as a mission theater. Play then begins from the cockpit of an F-15 already in flight and equipped with a variety of missiles, bombs, drop tanks, flares and chaff. The player flies the plane in combat to bomb various targets including a primary and secondary target while also engaging in air-to-air combat with enemy fighters.

The game ends when either the player's plane crashes, is destroyed, or when the player returns to base.

==Ports==
The game was first released for the Atari 8-bit family, with ports appearing from 1985-87 for the Apple II, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, MSX, and Amstrad CPC. It was also ported to the IBM PC as a [[self-booting disk]], being one of the first games that MicroProse company released for IBM compatibles. The initial IBM release came on a [[PC booter|self-booting]] 5.25" floppy disk and supported only [[Color/Graphics Adapter|CGA]] graphics, but a revised version in 1986 was offered on 3.5" disks and added limited [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] support (which added the ability to change color palettes if an EGA card was present).

Versions for the Game Boy, Game Gear, and NES were published in the early 1990s.
