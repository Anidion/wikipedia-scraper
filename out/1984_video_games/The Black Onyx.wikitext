{{nihongo|'''''The Black Onyx'''''|ザ・ブラックオニキス|Za Burakku Onikisu}} is a 1984 [[role-playing video game]] released in Japan, developed by [[Blue Planet Software|Bullet-Proof Software]], with development led by [[Henk Rogers]].<ref name=USGamer>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/daily-classics-black-onyx-the-missionary-of-role-playing-games |title=Daily Classic: The Black Onyx, Japan's Role-Playing Game Missionary |author= Jeremy Parish |date=2014-08-18|accessdate=2017-10-24 |publisher=www.usgamer.net}}</ref> It was originally released for the [[NEC PC-8801]], and ported to several other platforms. The [[Famicom]] version featured completely redesigned gameplay, a new map, and was retitled '''''Super Black Onyx''''' (スーパーブラックオニキス). The Game Boy Color port was developed by Atelier Double and published by [[Taito]]. The Game Boy Color port added enhanced visuals and included an option to play through the game with the original game's visual style.<ref name=GiantBomb>{{cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/the-black-onyx/3030-1032/ |title=The Black Onyx |accessdate=2017-10-24 |publisher=www.GiantBomb.com }}</ref>

Because of memory limitations, another  part of the game was released separately on some platforms as {{nihongo|'''''The Fire Crystal'''''|ザ・ファイアクリスタル}} (which added a magic system). Two other parts were announced, {{nihongo|'''''The Moonstone'''''|ザ・ムーンストーン}} (which allowed the party to explore the wilderness), and {{nihongo|'''''Arena'''''|アリーナ}} (which allowed the party to take part in Arena battles).

The [[SG-1000]] version was one of the last releases for that console, succeeded by ''Portrait of Loretta''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Marley|first=Scott |date=December 2016 |title=SG-1000 |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=163|page=60|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The player can create a five-member party (4 members on GBC), or can ask friendly encounters to join the party to fill empty slots. The party will explore the dungeons under the town of Utsuro (ウツロ) to obtain the legendary Black Onyx. Doing so will break the curse which binds the town in eternal night.

The combat system has no concept of distance, so there are no bows or similar missile weapons. There are melee weapons, shields, and armor, however. The hospital in town can offer "examinations" which display the PCs' [[Statistics|stats]].

The game displays a [[health meter]] to represent [[hit points]].<ref name="Szczepaniak">{{cite book |last1=Szczepaniak |first1=John |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |date=November 2015 |publisher=S.M.G Szczepaniak |isbn=978-1518818745 |volume=2 |edition=First |pages=32}}</ref>

There is a bank in town where the heroes can deposit money. This protects money from thieves.

The labyrinth under the town has several entrances, each hidden in one of the locations of the town. The labyrinth has six floors corresponding to the six colors the computer can display. These must be solved in the proper order (which depends on the [[Computing platform|platform]]) in order to create the stairway to the Black Tower, where the Onyx resides.

== Reception ==
It was one of the first successful [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese-language RPGs]], having [[List of best-selling PC games|sold]] 150,000 copies, and helped familiarize the Japanese public with RPGs.<ref name=Edge>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-japans-first-rpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820032405/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-japans-first-rpg |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-20 |author=Edge Staff |date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2011-04-08 |publisher=next-gen.biz |language=|title=THE MAKING OF... Japan's First RPG}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
[[T&E Soft]]'s Tokohiro Naito, the creator of [[action role-playing game]] ''[[Hydlide]]'' (1984), was influenced by ''The Black Onyx'', and combined its RPG elements with the [[action game]]play of ''[[The Tower of Druaga]]'' (1984). ''Hydlide'' also borrowed the [[health meter]] mechanic from ''The Black Onyx'', and took it a step further with a regenerating health meter.<ref name="Szczepaniak"/>

An English-language fan-translation was made available for the SG-1000 version in 2010 by back-porting from the abandoned source files for an incomplete 2007 hobby conversion project for the [[ColecoVision]] system.<ref name=SegaDoes>{{cite web|url=https://segadoes.wordpress.com/2014/12/12/the-black-onyx/ |title=The Black Onyx |author= Dylan Cornelius |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2022-04-11 |publisher=Sega Does}}</ref> Another group later used those same source files to complete the project and released an unofficial English-language ColecoVision game in 2013.<ref name=TeamPixelboy>{{cite web|url=http://www.teampixelboy.com/black_onyx.php |title=The Black Onyx (ColecoVision game) |date=2013|accessdate=2017-10-24 |publisher=www.teampixelboy.com}}</ref>

''The Black Onyx'' was adapted as a manga titled {{nihongo|''Susume!! Seigaku Dennou Kenkyuubu''|進め！！静学電脳研究部|Shiawase no katachi}}, published in the Gamest Comics collection from April 1999, drawn by Kouta Hirano.
