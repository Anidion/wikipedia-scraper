'''''Earthly Delights''''' is an [[Apple II series|Apple II]] [[text adventure]] game created by Roger Webster and Daniel Leviton and published by [[Datamost]] in 1984. It was ported to the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] (as a [[self-booting disk]]) and [[Macintosh]].

==Plot==
In ''Earthly Delights'', the story begins with the death of the player's uncle, whom they've not seen for many years, and the unusual inheritance received from him â€” a portrait of a beautiful woman entitled ''Earthly Delight''.  The uncle writes that pleasures and rewards will come to the player if they keep the picture, and exhorts them not to sell it.  When a stranger approaches the player offering an enormous sum for the work, their suspicions are aroused and the adventure of ''Earthly Delights'' begins.

The introduction to the game describes the painting as "Parrish's ''Earthly Delight''", alluding to American painter [[Maxfield Parrish]].  This allusion is supported by the painting's depiction on the cover, which mimics the mountainous landscape of Parrish's ''Canyon'' and female subject in flowing dress common in his works.  Though Parrish never created a piece named ''Earthly Delight'', Dutch artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]] painted a [[triptych]] named ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' in the early 16th century.
