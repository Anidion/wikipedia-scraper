'''''Boulder Dash''''' is a 2D [[Maze game|maze]]-[[puzzle video game]] released in 1984 by [[First Star Software]] for [[Atari 8-bit computers]].<ref name="weber2005">{{Cite web |last=Weber |first=Arno |title=Interview: Peter Liepa |website=Boulder-dash.nl |date=November 2005 |url=http://www.boulder-dash.nl/interview.php?lang=en |access-date=March 8, 2024}}</ref> It was created by Canadian developers Peter Liepa and Chris Gray. The player controls Rockford, who collects treasures while evading hazards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Boulder Dash |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7198 |access-date=October 6, 2013 |publisher=The International Arcade Museum}}</ref>

''Boulder Dash'' was ported to many 8-bit and 16-bit systems and turned into a coin-operated [[arcade video game]]. It was followed by multiple sequels and re-releases and influenced games such as ''[[Repton (video game)|Repton]]'' and direct clones such as ''[[Emerald Mine]]''.

As of January 2018, BBG Entertainment GmbH owns the intellectual property rights to ''Boulder Dash''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The game's name is a pun on ''[[balderdash]]''.<ref name="weber2005"/>

==Gameplay==
[[image:Boulderdash-screenshot.png|thumb|left|Rockford drops a series of boulders on butterflies which explode into diamonds and fall down the shafts.]]
''Boulder Dash'' takes place in a series of caves, each of which is laid out as rectangular grid of blocks. The player guides the player character, Rockford, with a [[joystick]] or [[arrow keys]]. In each cave, Rockford has to collect a set number of diamonds within a time limit. Player has to avoid falling rocks and other obstacles, including amoeba, butterflies, and fireflies. When enough diamonds have been collected, the exit door opens, and going through this exit door completes the cave.<ref name="cvg">{{Cite magazine |date=February 1985 |title=Boulder Dash |url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-040/page/n41/mode/1up?view=theater |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |pages=42 |issue=40}}</ref> 

==Development==
As an aspiring game developer, Peter Liepa reached out to a local publisher called Inhome Software. They put him in touch with a young man—Chris Gray—who had submitted a game programmed in [[BASIC]] that was not commercial quality, but had potential.{{sfn|Liepa|loc=7:05}} The project began with the intention of converting this game to machine language and releasing it through Inhome, but according to Liepa, the game was very primitive.{{sfn|Liepa|loc=7:48}} He decided to expand the concept and add more interesting dynamics, and he wrote the new version in [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]]{{sfn|Liepa|loc=5:09}} in about six months.{{sfn|Liepa|loc=10:28}} When it became clear that the game was worth releasing, Liepa rewrote ''Boulder Dash'' in 6502 [[assembly language]].{{sfn|Liepa|loc=5:15}}

Dissatisfied with the lack of a contact from Inhome Software, Liepa searched for a new publisher.{{sfn|Liepa|loc=12:37}} He settled on [[First Star Software]], which, according to him, was very happy to publish the game.{{sfn|Liepa|loc=14:00}}

==Ports==
The game was licensed by [[Exidy]] for use with their Max-A-Flex [[arcade cabinet]]. Released in 1984, it allows buying 30 seconds of game time.<ref name="retro3">{{Cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Campbell (blogger) |year=2008 |title=The Definitive Boulder Dash |journal=Retro Gamer |issue=53 |pages=32–41}}</ref> This was the first home computer game to be converted to an arcade console.<ref name="retro3" />

The ZX Spectrum version of Boulder Dash received a positive review from [[Computer and Video Games]] magazine. The reviewer found the game's sounds and graphics to be adequate, though noted that slow screen scrolling was an issue. Despite this, the reviewer praised the game's "incredible playability" and addictive nature.<ref name="cvg" />

The ZX Spectrum version was placed ninth in the ''[[Your Sinclair]] Top 100 Speccy Games Of All Time (Ever)'' by journalist [[Stuart Campbell (game journalist)|Stuart Campbell]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Campbell |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Campbell (game journalist) |date=January 1992 |title=The YS Top 100 Speccy Games Of All Time (Ever) - Number 24 to 2 |work=Your Sinclair |publisher=Future Publishing |issue=73 |url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-73#page/n35/mode/2up |access-date=10 May 2018}}</ref> In 1993, ''[[Commodore Force]]'' ranked the game at number 17 on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Ton!|url=https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-101/ZZap_64_Issue_101_Commodore_Force_Issue_11_1993_Autumn#page/n32/mode/1up/|website=Commodore Force|date=Autumn 1993|accessdate=2017-09-03|page=33}}</ref>

IGN reviewed the Virtual Console release of the Commodore 64 version. Although the graphics and sound were both found to be dated they enjoyed the game stating that it "still feels as fresh as it did in 1984". They concluded by stating "though it doesn't look like much, ''Boulder Dash'' rocks".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/23/boulder-dash-review|title = Boulder Dash Review|date = 23 June 2009}}</ref>
