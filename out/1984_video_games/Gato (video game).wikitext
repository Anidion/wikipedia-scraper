'''''GATO''''' is a real-time [[submarine simulator]] published in 1984 by [[Spectrum HoloByte]] for [[MS-DOS]]. It simulates combat operations aboard the Gato-class submarine {{USS|Growler|SS-215}} in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]]. ''GATO'' was later ported to the [[Apple IIe]], [[Atari ST]], and [[Mac (computer)|Mac]]. In 1987, [[Atari Corporation]] published a version on cartridge for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], to coincide with the launch of the [[Atari XEGS]].<ref>{{cite web|title=GATO XE Label|url=https://atariage.com/software_page.php?SoftwareID=3796|website=Atari Age}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
The player is tasked with chasing Japanese shipping across a 20-sector map while returning for resupply as necessary from a [[submarine tender]]. The islands on the map are randomly generated and not based on real-world geography. Combat is conducted using a screen with a view through the periscope and at various gauges and indicators. The game has multiple difficulty levels, the highest of which requires the player to translate mission briefings which are transmitted only as audible [[Morse Code]].

The MS-DOS and Apple IIe versions contain a [[boss key]] which replaces the game screen with a spreadsheet.

== Development ==
''Gato'' was developed by student programmers in [[Boulder, Colorado]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Flight-simulation game is so real that even A.F. wants a piece of action|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-fQoAAAAIBAJ&pg=6907,3498328&dq=market-gato&hl=en|newspaper=The Deseret News|date=24 January 1988}}</ref>

In 1985, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised the game for being simultaneously easy to play and having deep, detailed strategy.<ref name = "CGW">{{citation | date = Apr–May 1985 | last = Sipe | first = Russell | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = IBM Goes to War | pages = 24–25}}</ref> 1991 and 1993 surveys in the magazine of strategy and war games, however, gave it one and a half stars out of five, stating that "it was adequate in its time, but not exemplary in any regard".<ref name="brooks199111">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=88 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: The 1900-1950 Epoch / Part I (A-L) of an Annotated Paiktography | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
