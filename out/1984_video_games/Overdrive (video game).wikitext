'''''Overdrive''''' is a [[racing game]] written by Peter Johnson for the [[Acorn Electron]] and [[BBC Micro]] and published in 1984 by [[Superior Software]].

==Gameplay==
The game was probably inspired by the hugely successful [[Namco]]/[[Atari]] [[arcade game]] ''[[Pole Position (arcade game)|Pole Position]]'', one of the most popular arcade games of the era. It is also influenced by [[Sega]]'s 1981 game ''[[Turbo (video game)|Turbo]]''. Like those arcade games, ''Overdrive'' uses the "rear-view racer format" but there are no bends in the track. The aim of the game is to finish in the top 12 in order to qualify for the next track. There are five different tracks but as there are no bends, the only difference is the change in scenery (fields, night, snow, desert and riverside scenes) as well as a change in the grip.

Points are awarded for the distance travelled as well as a bonus given at the end of each level depending on the number of computer-controlled cars that have been passed. If the player collides with another car, they explode and regenerate. This can happen an infinite number of times but it wastes time and many opponents will pass while the player slowly accelerates. It is also common for opponents to crash into the back of the player while they are still accelerating causing another explosion.

The game was hugely successful selling almost 40,000 copies across both BBC Micro and Electron versions<ref>{{cite journal|title=HEADING FOR THE CENTURY|first=Tony|last=Leah|date=February 1989 |journal=Electron User|publisher=Database Publications}} <!--[http://www.stairwaytohell.com/articles/EUFEB89-Superior.html]--></ref> which was exceptional for that platform. It was Superior Software's biggest seller, out-selling even the individual ''[[Repton (computer game)|Repton]]'' titles. It was especially popular on the [[Acorn Electron]] (outselling the BBC version by a ratio of more than 2:1). This is probably down to the fact that it was the only 3D scrolling racing game available for the Electron for many years (with hardware limitations discouraging many conversions) while the BBC version had competition from more sophisticated simulations such as ''[[Revs (video game)|Revs]]'' as well as the official [[Atarisoft]] port of ''[[Pole Position (arcade game)|Pole Position]]''.

==Legacy==
''Overdrive'' remained the only 3D racing game available for the Electron until 1987 when Superior released the motorbike racer ''[[Crazee Rider]]'', a game originally conceived as a follow-up to ''Overdrive''. This game did include bends showing that it would have been possible but the fact that it took so long for another such game to be released shows what a technical achievement converting ''Overdrive'' for the Electron had been. Also in 1987, ''Overdrive'' was included on the ''Superior Collection'' compilations (vol. 2 on the BBC, vol. 3 on the Electron), meaning it was still available until the demand for [[8-bit]] games dried up in the early 1990s.
