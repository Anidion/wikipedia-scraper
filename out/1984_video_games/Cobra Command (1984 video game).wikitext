'''''Cobra Command''''', known as {{nihongo|'''''Thunder Storm'''''|サンダーストーム}} in [[Japan]], is an [[interactive movie]] [[shooter game]] originally released by [[Data East]] in 1984 as a [[LaserDisc]]-based [[arcade game]]. Released as an [[arcade conversion]] kit for ''[[Bega's Battle]]'' (1983), ''Cobra Command'' became one of the more successful laserdisc games [[1984 in video games|in 1984]]. A [[Mega-CD]] port of ''Cobra Command'' developed by [[Namco Tales Studio|Wolf Team]] was released in [[1992 in video gaming|1992]].

== Plot ==
Terrorists are threatening the [[free world]] and have amassed a diabolical force. Only the brave pilot of ''Cobra Command'' can vanquish the terrorist threat and save the free world from total destruction. The player assumes the role as pilot of the LX-3 Super Cobra helicopter (fictional, but similar to the [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra]]).

The missions go across the [[New York City]] streets, the [[Statue of Liberty]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Italy]], the [[Grand Canyon]] and the enemy's headquarters on [[Easter Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/cobra-command_|title=Cobra Command|publisher=Mobygames|date=1984|access-date=10 June 2014}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
The original arcade version is an [[interactive movie]] and [[Shooter game|shooter]] game, where the player watches scenes as the helicopter flies by the conflict zone. The game screen is represented by the helicopter's cockpit, and the player controls a crosshair that can be moved to aim at the enemy forces. The game features a joystick and two buttons: one '''Machine Gun''' and one '''Missile'''. The game can be played with 1 or 2 players.

In certain moments, the voice of the pilot's [[commanding officer]] helps the player out with completing each mission by firing at enemy forces and dodging both enemy fire and natural surroundings, by pressing the joystick or directional pad in the correct direction and at the right time.

If the pilot makes a mistake, the anime sequence shows the Cobra helicopter blown up and the player loses a life. If all lives are lost, the "Game Over" screen shows the Cobra in smoldering ruins and its pilot is presumably dead from the crash.

== Development ==
''[[Kunio-kun]]'' and ''[[Double Dragon (series)|Double Dragon series]]'' creator Yoshihisa Kishimoto designed an entirely new game, ''Cobra Command'', using Data East's ''[[Bega's Battle]]'' hardware.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Kishimoto would work later on ''[[Road_Blaster|Road Blaster/Road Avenger]]'', made with the same arcade technology.
As the Double Dragon saga was made after those LaserDisc arcades, we can see the LX3 chopper from Cobra Command/Thunder Storm at the beginning of [[Double_Dragon_II%3A_The_Revenge|Double Dragon 2]], and at some point in the gameplay of [[Road_Blaster|Road Blaster/Road Avenger]] arcade as a nice homage, made by his creator.

''Cobra Command'' was developed by Data East in co-operation with [[Toei Animation]]. It was first published in [[Japan]] in 1984 as ''Thunder Storm'', then released later the same year in [[North America]] as ''Cobra Command''.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Thunder Storm'' on their May 15, 1984 issue as being the most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=236|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 May 1984|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref> It remained at the top of Japan's upright/cockpit [[arcade cabinet]] charts for four months [[1984 in video games|in 1984]], through June<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=237|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 June 1984|page=29|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840601p.pdf#page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=238|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 June 1984|page=25|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840615p.pdf#page=13}}</ref> and July<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=239|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 July 1984|page=25|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840701p.pdf#page=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=240|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 July 1984|page=37|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840715p.pdf#page=19}}</ref> to August.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=Game Machine|issue=241|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=1 August 1984|page=27|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840801p.pdf#page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=242|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 August 1984|page=25|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840815p.pdf#page=13}}</ref>

In North America, ''Cobra Command'' was released as an [[arcade conversion]] kit for the previously unsuccessful ''Bega's Battle''. ''Cobra Command'' was more successful, becoming one of the more successful laserdisc games in 1984.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=1984—Even Orwell Couldn't Predict How Bad It Was |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=December 15, 1984 |volume=10 |issue=23 |pages=23–8 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-10-number-23-december-15th-1984/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%2010%2C%20Number%2023%20-%20December%2015th%201984/page/23}}</ref> In the United States, ''Cobra Command'' topped the ''[[Play Meter]]'' laserdisc arcade charts from October to November 1984.<ref name="November">{{cite magazine |title=National Play Meter |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=15 November 1984 |volume=10 |issue=21 |pages=28–9 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-10-number-21-november-15th-1984-600DPI/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%2010%2C%20Number%2021%20-%20November%2015th%201984%20%28Compressed%29/page/28}}</ref> However, while it was one of the more successful laserdisc games that year, it was not able to achieve mass appeal due to the laserdisc market being in decline at the time.<ref name="Sharpe">{{cite magazine |last=Sharpe |first=Roger C. |title=1984—Every Which Way But Up |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=December 15, 1984 |volume=10 |issue=23 |pages=39, 49–51 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-10-number-23-december-15th-1984/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%2010%2C%20Number%2023%20-%20December%2015th%201984/page/49}}</ref>

Roger C. Sharpe of ''Play Meter'' called the arcade game one of the few "shining lights" in the laserdisc arcade market of 1984. They said it "brought the technology another small step closer to where it will ultimately go in the future."<ref name="Sharpe"/>

Reviewing the Sega CD version in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine, [[Glenn Rubenstein]] praised the high number of levels and unique interface. He gave the game a B−.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Glenn|date=January 1993|title=At the Controls|url=https://archive.org/details/WizardMagazine017/page/n23/mode/2up|journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]|publisher=[[Wizard Entertainment]]|issue=17|pages=21–24}}</ref>

On release, ''[[Famicom Tsūshin]]'' scored the Sega Saturn version of the game 25 out of 40 and the PlayStation version 23 out of 40.<ref>NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: サンダーストーム&ロードブラスター. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.358. Pg.31. 27 October 1995.</ref>

== Legacy ==
Data East released a second game titled ''[[Cobra Command (1988 video game)|Cobra Command]]'' in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]]. Unlike the 1984 version, the 1988 arcade game is a side-scrolling [[shoot-'em-up]].

The Cobra helicopter has a brief cameo in the garage of the Dragon Brothers as they depart in ''[[Double Dragon II: The Revenge]]''.

The original ''Cobra Command'' was re-released in Japan for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]] in 1995 in a two-in-one compilation with ''[[Road Blaster]]'', another FMV game produced by the same team.

In November 2009, Revolutionary Concepts developed and published an enhanced iPhone OS version of the original arcade game.
 
In April 2010, [[G-Mode]] released an official port for Windows and Sharp X68030 computers. This product was only available for the Japanese market.
