'''''Treasure Island''''' is a 1984 computer game based on the 1883 novel ''[[Treasure Island]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. In the game, the player takes on the role of the book's protagonist [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]] and has to battle through hordes of [[Piracy|pirates]] before a final showdown with [[Long John Silver]].

The programming was done by Greg Duddle, and the music was rendered by [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]].<ref>[http://www.c64gg.com/T19.html C64 Game Guide]</ref> The version for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] was released in 1984, and the [[Commodore Plus/4]] version was from 1985.  The latter version is bug free and has minor differences.  On the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum it is impossible to get the maximum score because of bugs.  The Commodore Plus/4 version was also converted for the [[Corvette (computer)|Corvette]] in 1989.
