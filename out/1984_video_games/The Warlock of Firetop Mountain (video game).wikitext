'''''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain''''' is an [[action game]] published by [[Crystal Computing]] in 1984 for the [[ZX Spectrum]] [[home computer]]. It is loosely based on the [[Gamebook#Adventure gamebooks|adventure gamebook]] of [[The Warlock of Firetop Mountain|the same name]] (the first in the ''[[Fighting Fantasy]]'' series) written by [[Steve Jackson (UK)|Steve Jackson]] and [[Ian Livingstone]], and published by [[Puffin Books]] in 1982.

The game was sold both as a regular [[Cassette tape|cassette]]-only release and as a "software pack" edition that included a copy of the original ''Fighting Fantasy'' title at a higher price point.

==Gameplay==
As a [[Third-person (gaming)|third-person]] [[arcade adventure]] game, the player takes the role of an adventurer on a [[quest]] to find the treasure of a powerful [[warlock]], hidden deep within Firetop Mountain. The treasure is stored in a chest with fifteen locks, with the keys guarded by various monsters (e.g. [[orc]]s, [[slime mould]]s and spiders) in the [[dungeon]]s of Firetop Mountain. The adventurer (equipped with a bow and a sword) must attempt to retrieve the keys, with an added feature (over the game's predecessor, ''[[Halls of the Things]]'') being the ability to open and close doors to block the path of pursuing monsters. Gameplay varies with each new game as the maze is [[randomly generated]].<ref name="crashreview"/>

==Development==
''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'' was announced in issue two of ''Micro Adventurer'' magazine, which  published a feature on the expansion of [[Penguin Books]] children's imprint [[Puffin Books|Puffin]] into the [[science fiction]] software market with the video game ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'', hoping to emulate the success of the book title.<ref>Penguin Launches into SF Software, ''Micro Adventurer'', issue 2, p.7, Sunshine Books, December 1983</ref> The game was announced as the first in the "Puffin Personal Computer Collection"<ref>Puffin advertisement for the four launch titles of the new range. Printed in ''Sinclair User'' issue 22 (p.16) and ''CRASH'' issue 1 (p.7)</ref> line together with three other unrelated titles (based on science fiction titles by author Peter K. McBride).<ref name="microadventurer"/>

Puffin contracted [[Crystal Computing]], who had developed the fantasy game ''[[Halls of the Things]]'', to create the game.<ref>''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'', in-game instructions</ref><ref name="cvgreview"/> Game designer simon Brattel stated "We ended up doing it quite by accident — we simply bumped into [[Steve Jackson (UK game designer)|Steve Jackson]], one of the authors of the book, in [[Currys]] one day — we got talking, he came back and looked at ''Halls'' and liked it."<ref>As Clear as Crystal, ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'', 26 January-1 February 1984 (p.26), Sunshine Publications Ltd.</ref>

According to hidden text within the game's code the developers only had three weeks to complete the project.<ref>[http://equ.in/ox/spectrum/eggs/design_design.php Spectrum Easter Eggs], equ.in. Text referred to reads "We apologise for the game being boring but we were literally only given 3 weeks to write it". {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915195720/http://equ.in/ox/spectrum/eggs/design_design.php |date=September 15, 2009 }}</ref> The [[Peter Andrew Jones]] artwork for the original title was used for the video game cover.<ref>''[[The Warlock of Firetop Mountain]]'' by Steve Jackon and Ian Livingstone, Puffin Books, 1982</ref>

Puffin Books briefly continued the trend of adapting the ''Fighting Fantasy'' titles into video games, with early titles ''[[The Citadel of Chaos]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uvlist.net/game-156749-The+Citadel+of+Chaos|title=The Citadel of Chaos (1984) by Puffin Books ZX Spectrum game}}</ref> and ''[[The Forest of Doom]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehouseofgames.net/index.php?t=10&id=271|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517045806/http://www.thehouseofgames.net/index.php?t=10&id=271|url-status=usurped|archive-date=May 17, 2006|title = The House of Games.net - Forest of Doom - abandonware / Free games / Manuals}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001842|title = World of Spectrum - the Forest of Doom}}</ref> being released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]] respectively.

==Reception==
''ZX Computing'' described the game as simply a "variation" of ''Halls of the Things'', but praised the inclusion of the book as it encouraged children to read.<ref name="zxcomputing">Booked!, ''ZX Computing'', issue 4, p.119, Argus Specialist Publications Ltd, April/May 1984</ref> ''Micro Adventurer'' also commented on the similarities, stating that "it is so similar that it would be pointless buying both games".<ref name="microadventurer">''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'' review, ''Micro Adventurer'', issue 4, p.24, Sunshine Books, February 1984</ref>

''[[Crash (magazine)|CRASH]]'' magazine criticized the control scheme  (the number of control keys and the developer's decision to use the horizontally adjacent N and M keys to move the player's character up and down) but also claimed the game less difficult and confusing, and with better graphics.<ref name="crashreview">''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'' review, ''[[Crash (magazine)|CRASH]]'', issue 1, p.13, [[Newsfield Publications Ltd]], February 1984</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' expressed disappointment that the game had little resemblance to the original ''Fighting Fantasy'' title.<ref name="cvgreview">A Thing is a Thing is a Thing, ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', issue 29, p.151, [[EMAP]], March 1983</ref>
