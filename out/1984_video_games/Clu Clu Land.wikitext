== Title ==
Although "Clu Clu Land" is the official English title for the game, "Clu Clu" is actually an anglicization of "Kuru Kuru"; a Japanese [[onomatopoeia]] that refers to something going "around and around". In order for Bubbles to move around the mazes, she must grab onto poles with her hands. When she holds on to a pole without letting go, she spins "around and around". The same phrase is also the basis for the title of the [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Kuru Kuru Kururin]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Clu_Clu_Land_screenshot.gif|thumb|left|NES version, showing Bubbles (red), Unira (blue), and treasures]]

In ''Clu Clu Land'', the player is a female [[balloonfish]] named Bubbles, known as {{nihongo foot|Gloopy|グルッピー|Guruppī|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan, who swims around in a maze trying to uncover all the golden Ingots.<ref name="Weiss2012">{{cite book|author=Brett Weiss|title=Classic Home Video Games, 1985-1988: A Complete Reference Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F01wiUr9LKQC&pg=PT180|date=12 November 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0141-0|page=180}}</ref>

The story starts with a type of [[sea urchin]], the Unira, stealing all of the treasures in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land. Bubbles, the heroine, sets out to retrieve the treasure. The object of the game is to uncover all the gold ingots in each stage while avoiding the Unira and Black Holes. Ingots usually form a shape such as a heart or a mushroom. The only way Bubbles can turn around to change directions is by means of Turning Posts located throughout the stages. She can stun the Unira by using a Sound Wave. When they are stunned, she can push them into a wall to get rid of them and receive points. If Bubbles is hurt by the Unira, she will lose a life. A life is also lost if she falls into a Black Hole, or if time runs out. The game ends when Bubbles has lost all her lives.

In later levels, the player must pass over the ingots an odd number of times to uncover them, as they will alternate between their uncovered side and a dull side.

== Ports==
An expanded edition known as {{nihongo foot|'''''VS. Clu Clu Land'''''|VSクルクルランド|VS Kurukuru Rando|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released for the [[Video arcade|coin-op]] [[Nintendo VS. System]]. It contains twice as many puzzles, a new enemy named Boss Unira, different level themes, and other adjustments. A port of this version was released as the final game for the [[Family Computer Disk System]] (FDS), titled ''Clu Clu Land: Welcome to New Clu Clu Land''. It contains a few minor enhancements such as difficulty selection.

In September 2001, a port was released for the [[Sharp Zaurus]] series of PDAs.<ref name=sharpzaurus/>

== Reception ==
{{expand-section|date=May 2024}}
In a June 1986 survey of the NES catalogue, the ''Chicago Tribune''{{'s}} Steven Kosek and Dennis Lynch singled out ''Clu Clu Land'' and ''[[Ice Climber]]'' for "[keeping their] interest after repeated plays."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kosek |first1=Steven |last2=Lynch |first2=Dennis |title=Audio/video: Video machines increase power to hold market |url=https://newspapers.com/article/chicago-tribune-video-machines-increase/110187348/ |access-date=2024-05-29 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1986-06-27 |page=82 (Section 7) |url-access=registration |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

Various elements from ''Clu Clu Land'' appear throughout the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series. Bubbles appears as a trophy in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

A medley of various tracks from the original game is selectable as background music for a number of stages in several games in the series, and Bubbles and Unira are featured as Spirits in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]''.
