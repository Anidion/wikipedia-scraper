Fuka created the title without any expectation of financial gain. The Czechoslovak  video gaming development industry was predominantly young high school or college aged males who attended computer clubs, and who made games individually. This made it difficult for the amateur one-team developers to complete with Western professional companies. Fuka would proclaim in 1998: "The few individuals that make games in our country can naturally hardly compete with teams of specialists, for whom making games is not only fun, but also a job (a paid one, of course). One person can hardly be a good author of a game idea, a programmer, a graphic artist, a musician and also have enough time to pull it all off".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Švelch|first=Jaroslav|date=December 2013|title=Say it with a Computer Game: Hobby Computer Culture and the Non-entertainment Uses of Homebrew Games in the 1980s Czechoslovakia|url=http://gamestudies.org/1302/articles/svelch|journal=Game Studies|volume=13|issue=2|issn=1604-7982}}</ref>

==Reception==
Tiscali.cz thought it was a very simple and short attempt at a game, but that it offered a great foreshadowing of where Fuka's career would end up.<ref name="auto"/>
