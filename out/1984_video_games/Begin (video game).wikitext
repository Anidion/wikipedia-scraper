detailed simulator [[audio game#TTS software and the PC – the second wave|accessible to the blind]]."<ref>{{cite journal | title = Replay Value: The Scarce Quantity of Quality | journal = Audyssey Magazine | date = July–August 1996 | first = Michael | last = Feir | issue = 1| url = http://www.audiogames.net/page.php?pagefile=_Audyssey_Magazine_issue_1_-_July_-_August_1996_ | access-date = 2010-07-19}}</ref> According to PC-SIG, the "computer strategy is quite effective."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://193.166.3.2/pub/msdos/pc-sig/1600-1699/ | title = Disk1692: BEGIN a tactical starship simulation | access-date = 2010-07-19 | year = 1998 | work = PC-SIG Library | publisher = PC-SIG | quote = The computer strategy is quite effective, the novice captain probably will not win in a one on one confrontation.

== Legacy ==
''Begin 2'', released in 1991,  is a tactical starship simulator game set in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe released in 1991. It is the sequel to ''Begin''. The screen is similar to the one in ''Begin''. The main difference is that the sequel featured VGA graphics whereas the original used pure ASCII screen characters (text mode). Extra ships and weapons were added as well. However, each ship is individually represented in the game, and can be individually operated and commanded by the player. Each ship has a unique set of weapons and resources. As with the first game, one of the most notable features of this game is its highly mathematical nature, and its lack of random factors.
