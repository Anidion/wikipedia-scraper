'''''Mr. Wimpy''''', subtitled '''''The Hamburger Game''''', is a [[platform game]] released by [[Ocean Software]] in 1984 for the [[Oric 1]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[Commodore 64]]. It was a promotional tie with the [[Wimpy (restaurant)|Wimpy]] restaurant chain, and the game includes the Wimpy logo, mascot, and theme tune.<ref>Conrad Lashley, Alison Morrison In Search of Hospitality 2013 "The Wimpy fast food chain coined its name from J Wellington Wimpy, the dumpy hamburger guzzling character in the Popeye cartoon strip. Wimpy use Mr Wimpy, an exaggerated beefeater figure, to advertise and promote their product"</ref> The gameplay is based on the 1982 [[Data East]] arcade video game ''[[BurgerTime]]''.<ref name=oceanthehistory108 />

==Gameplay==
Mr. Wimpy has to cross his kitchen while avoiding moving manholes to get to the larder so that he can collect ingredients and make his burgers. As an added hazard, a character called Waldo tries to steal these ingredients from him. After the opening level, the game becomes a ''[[BurgerTime]]'' clone where the player must guide Mr. Wimpy across the platforms while walking over four various burger ingredients, which in turn causes them to crash to the platform below and finally to the four plates at the bottom. Mr. Wimpy must also avoid various enemies.  The player can spray pepper at the enemies, which temporarily freezes them for a few seconds. Enemies can also be trapped and squashed by walking over burger ingredients while they are on the level below.<ref name="crash-review">{{cite magazine|date=March 1984|title=Mr. Wimpy|magazine=Crash|issue=2|page=76|publisher=Newsfield|accessdate=4 February 2021|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=969&page=76

The platform portion of the game features the following enemies: Sid Sos (a walking sausage), Ogy Egg (a walking fried egg), Sam Spoon (a walking spoon), and Pam Pickle (a walking pickle).<ref name="crash-review" />  As the player progresses in the game, the number of enemies increases. Mr. Wimpy's only defences against the enemies are to trap them between the falling burger ingredients and to temporarily freeze them with pepper. Only a small supply of pepper (up to 4 bottles) can be carried at a time; when the player is low on pepper, more can be acquired by collecting a coffee cup or ice cream. Players are given four lives at the start of the game, any of which can be lost in the opening Larder level by falling down a moving pothole or by getting caught by an enemy in the platform portion of the game.

==Release==
A ''Mr. Wimpy'' Championship was held simultaneously in London and Manchester. It was won by fourteen-year-old Andrew Blackley.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=March 1984|title=News|magazine=Sinclair User|issue=24|page=18|publisher=EMAP|accessdate=4 February 2021|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=24&page=18
