Several home ports were released by [[Domark]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[BBC Micro]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Atari ST]],<ref name="atarimania">{{cite web|title=Star Wars: Return of the Jedi|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-st-star-wars-return-of-the-jedi_10389.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref> [[Commodore 64]],<ref name=lemon64>{{lemon64 game|id=2128}}</ref> and [[Amiga]]<ref name="hol">{{cite web|url=http://hol.abime.net/1227|website=Amiga Hall of Light|title=Star Wars: Return of the Jedi}}</ref> in 1988.

The player takes control of three different vehicles in stages based upon the ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' film. Gameplay is from an [[Isometric projection|isometrically projected]] perspective and is broken into three stages. In the first, the player pilots a [[speeder bike]] to the [[Ewok]] village. The next stage involves piloting the [[Millennium Falcon]] to destroy a reactor. Another speeder bike stage follows. The final stage involves piloting both an [[Walker (Star Wars)|AT-ST]] and the Millennium Falcon in rapid succession in a fight against a [[Star Destroyer]].
