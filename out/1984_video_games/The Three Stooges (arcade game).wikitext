'''''The Three Stooges''''', shown as '''''The Three Stooges in Brides is Brides''''' on the title screen, is a 1984 [[arcade game]] by [[Gottlieb|Mylstar Electronics]]. It is based on [[The Three Stooges|the comedy act of the same name]].

==Gameplay==
The game features digital voice samples. At the start of the game, up to three players control [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]] and [[Curly Howard]]. Players must help the Three Stooges find their fiancees, Cora, Nora and Dora, who were kidnapped by the Mad Scientist.  In all rooms, players must find three hidden keys that unlock the exit. Interfering socialites and cops are dealt with in typical Stooges-style: face slaps, hammer hits, and the ever-dependable cream pie throws. In the bonus rounds, players must avoid the opera singer's sour notes, as well as cops, while collecting the three keys to the exit. In the Mad Scientist's laboratory, the players will be able to save only one fianc√©e, before players must find the other two fiancees.  After all fiancees are saved, the game starts over.
