{{nihongo foot|'''''Super Xevious'''''|スーパーゼビウス|Sūpā Zebiusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a  vertically [[scrolling shooter]] released as an [[arcade video game]] in Japan in 1984. It was developed and published by [[Namco]] as an updated version of ''[[Xevious]]'' (1982) created as a response to the overwhelming success of the original in Japan. It was sold as  conversion kit for existing ''Xevious'' cabinets.

Like the original game, the player controls a starship known as the ''Solvalou'', equipped with two weapons: an "air zapper" to defeat flying enemies, and a "blaster bomb" to destroy ground-based enemies. It runs on the [[Namco Galaga]] arcade board. New enemy types include metallic ''[[Galaxian]]'' flagships. Some of these revert the player's score to zero if destroyed. The game was ported to the [[X68000]] and [[PlayStation]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Massey |first1=Tom |title=Death from Above: The making of Slap Fight MD |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-12-death-from-above-the-making-of-slap-fight-md |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=May 10, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320144329/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-12-death-from-above-the-making-of-slap-fight-md |archivedate=March 20, 2017 |date=December 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Substance D |title=Xevious 3D/G - The Battle Enters A New Dimension |url=https://archive.org/details/GamefanVolume5Issue05May1997/page/n43/mode/2up/search/Xevious?q=Xevious |accessdate=March 17, 2020 |agency=[[GameFan]] |issue=5 |publisher=Metropolis Media |date=May 1997 |volume=5 |pages=42–43}}</ref> and is included in several [[List of Bandai Namco video game compilations|Namco video game compilations]].

Its inclusion in ''[[Xevious 3D/G+]]'' drew mixed responses from critics. Graeme Nicholson, a writer for ''[[Play UK]]'', believed that while ''Super'' was still fun to play and posed enough challenge, its differences from the original ''[[Xevious]]'' were few and far between and "[spoiled] the idea of the collection slightly".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nicholson |first1=Graeme |title=Review - Xevious 3D/G+ |url=https://archive.org/details/play-023/page/n61/mode/2up |accessdate=September 6, 2020 |agency=[[Play UK]] |issue=23 |publisher=[[Paragon Publishing]] |date=August 1997 |page=62}}</ref> A writer for the Spanish magazine ''PSX Magazine'' agreed, describing it as a "decaffinated" variation of its predecessor with little in the way of new content. However, they liked the slightly-refined visuals and overall increase in speed.<ref>{{cite news |title=PrePlay - Xevious 3D/G+ |url=https://archive.org/details/PSX_Magazine_09 |accessdate=September 6, 2020 |agency=PSX Magazine |issue=9 |date=September 1997 |page=51 |language=es}}</ref>

Retrospectively in 1998, ''[[AllGame]]''{{'}}s Earl Green noted of ''Super''{{'}}s high level of difficulty and new enemy types, writing that its enhanced challenge and differences in gameplay made it a superior update to ''Xevious''.<ref name="Allgame"/> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' writer Stuart Campbell showed appreciation towards its new additions to the game, namely the silver ''Galaxian'' bosses.<ref name="RGamer"/>

Former [[Happy End (band)|Happy End]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] member [[Haruomi Hosono]] recorded an arranged [[electronic dance music|dance]]/[[synthpop]] version of the game's theme tune, which was released in Japan by [[Alfa Records]]' Yen label as a 12" single on August 29, 1984. The single was also released in Europe by Pick Up Records that same year.
