'''''Pitstop II''''' is a 1984 sequel to the 1983 [[racing game]] ''[[Pitstop (video game)|Pitstop]]'', both of which were published by [[Epyx]]. Ported to more platforms than the original, ''Pitstop II'' was released for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], and as a [[self-booting disk]] for [[IBM PC compatible]]s. [[Apple II]] and [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] versions were released in 1985.

''Pitstop II'' adds a [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]], simultaneous two-player game mode. Players can be in completely different places on the racing track, and each half of the screen shows the view of the track according to the player's position.

The game requires that players keep an eye on their tires and fuel gauge. Players are able to pull in for a [[pit stop]] to change tires as well as re-fuel.

Six international race tracks are available: [[Brands Hatch]], [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]], [[Rouen-Les-Essarts]], [[Sebring International Raceway|Sebring]], [[ACI Vallelunga Circuit|Vallelunga]], and [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] — with a choice of either racing for three, six or nine laps and from one of three difficulty levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=055&amp;page=049&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap&amp;check=1|title = Impossible to Display Scan}}</ref>

==Reception==
''[[Zzap!64]]'' called ''Pitstop II'' "Fantastic! ... a SUPERB implementation of the 3D racing format ... This has to be the best ever driving game".{{r|zzap198506}}

IGN reviewed the Virtual Console release. They thought that the game was worth playing for nostalgic reasons but might not appeal to those unfamiliar with the title due to dated graphics, sound and controls. It was rated 6/10.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/02/25/pitstop-ii-review|title = Pitstop II Review - IGN| date=25 February 2009 }}</ref>
