'''''Mr. Mephisto''''' is a [[video game]] written for the [[Commodore 64]] by Dave Lucas and published by Euro-Byte in 1984.<ref name=lemon/> The graphics are by Graham Hunt. A port to the [[BBC Micro]] followed in 1986.

==Gameplay==
The game consists of a number of levels through which the player navigates to collect rings and make it safely to an exit. A team of demons attempt to block the player's path. Contact with a demon results in instant death, and one or more scrolling staircases further hamper the player's progress.

==Ports==
Following success in the C64 market, Euro-Byte commissioned a port of the game to the [[BBC Micro]]. However, no source code was available as the game had been coded in [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] assembler directly into the C64's monitor program. The game was re-written from scratch. Euro-Byte subsequently commissioned a version for the [[Acorn Electron]], but this was never released.
