{{nihongo|'''''Champion Boxing'''''|チャンピオンボクシング||"Boxing Champion"}} is a 1984 [[boxing]] [[sports video game]] developed and published by [[Sega]] for the [[SG-1000]],<ref name=GameSpy>[http://cheats.gamespy.com/sg1000/champion-boxing/index.html Champion Boxing]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[GameSpy]]</ref> and later ported to  the arcades,<ref name=KLOV>{{KLOV game|id=7308}}</ref> only in [[Japan]] and [[Europe]]. It was [[Sega-AM2]] founder and leader [[Yu Suzuki]]'s debut creation, as well as that of [[Rieko Kodama]].<ref name="gccx"/> In 1985, a successor of ''Champion Boxing'' titled ''Champion Pro Wrestling'' was released in the arcades, and ported to the SG-1000 and the [[MSX]] home computer the same year. However, this is a [[professional wrestling]] game instead of a boxing game.

==Development==
[[Yu Suzuki]] described ''Champion Boxing'' as a minor project with very little staff, and said that because of this it allowed him to learn the process of games development with very little pressure.<ref name="Retro163">{{cite magazine|last=Marley|first=Scott |date=December 2016 |title=Q&A with Yu Suzuki |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=163|page=61|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]}}</ref> Because the game was understaffed for designers, Suzuki actually contributed some of the drawings for the various punching animations.<ref name="Retro163"/>

According to Suzuki, the game was developed for the SG-1000 first, and then the arcade version was created by simply installing an SG-1000 in an arcade cabinet.<ref name="Retro163"/>

''[[Pengo (video game)|Pengo]]'' makes a cameo after a KO.
