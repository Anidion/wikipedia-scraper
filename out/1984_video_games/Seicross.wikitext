'''''Seicross''''', known as {{nihongo foot|'''''Sector Zone'''''|セクターゾーン|Sekutā Zōn|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in [[Japan]], is a [[Shooter game|shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed and released by [[Nichibutsu]] in Japan and [[North America]].  Despite the original arcade game being titled ''Sector Zone'', Nichibutsu later ported it to the [[Famicom]] as {{nihongo|''Seicross''|セクロス}}. This port was also published in North America for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Fujisankei Communications International|FCI]].

== Overview ==

During the game play of ''Seicross'', the player rides a gliding motorcycle-like vehicle, bumping other riders, collecting power modules and collecting blue people who are stranded.  A second area removes the riders and adds rough terrain, while the final leg features a battle with one or more Dinosaur Tanks, which launch their heads when destroyed.  The sequence repeats infinitely, getting progressively difficult and changing backgrounds.

==Reception==
Gene Lewin of ''[[Play Meter]]'' rated the arcade game 8 out of 10, stating it "is challenging as well as fun to play."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Lewin |first1=Gene |title=Gene's Gudgements: 'Seicross' should earn well |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=December 1, 1984 |volume=10 |issue=22 |pages=81–2 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-10-number-22-december-1st-1984/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%2010%2C%20Number%2022%20-%20December%201st%201984/page/81}}</ref>
