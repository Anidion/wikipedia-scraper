'''''Mr. Do's Wild Ride''''' is a [[platform game]] released in 1984 as the third in [[Universal (game company)|Universal]]'s ''[[Mr. Do!]]'' [[arcade video game]] series. An [[MSX]] version was published in 1985.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Mr_Do's_Wild_Ride_Arcade_Gameplay_Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Mr. Do must reach the top of the level, and climb ladders to avoid roller coaster cars and other hazards.]]

Mr. Do!'s scenario is a roller coaster, and the object is to reach the top. As the cars (and eventually other objects) speed around the track, the player must escape by using a super speed button, or by climbing up small ladders scattered about the track to dodge the hazards. Two icons at the end of the level range from cakes to EXTRA letters or diamonds change upon collecting cherries at the top of each letter. The game is timed, and the timer ticks faster when the super speed button is held down. Collision with a roller coaster car or another object is fatal, knocking Mr. Do! off the coaster and costing a life.

After the sixth level is completed, the game cycles back to the first with various obstacles and/or more roller coaster cars to avoid.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Mr. Do's Wild Ride'' on their April 15, 1984 issue as being the sixth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=234|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 April 1984|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>
