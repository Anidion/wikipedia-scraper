'''''Colossus Chess''''' is a series of [[chess engine|chess-playing computer programs]] developed by [[Martin Bryant (programmer)|Martin Bryant]], commercially released for various [[home computer]]s in the 1980s.

==History==
[[Image:Colossus Chess 4 C64 2D.png|thumb|left|''Colossus Chess 4.0'' on [[Commodore 64]]]]

Bryant started ''Colossus Chess'' in 1983, using his ''[[White Knight Mk 11]]'' program,<ref name="Colossus">{{cite web | url=http://www.colossusgames.co.uk/chess/colossuschess.htm | title=Colossus Chess | first=Martin | last=Bryant | authorlink=Martin Bryant (programmer) | accessdate=2008-05-22 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124083132/http://www.colossusgames.co.uk/chess/colossuschess.htm | archivedate=2013-11-24 }}</ref> winner of the 1983 European Microcomputer Chess Championship,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.colossusgames.co.uk/chess/whiteknight.htm | title=White Knight | first=Martin | last=Bryant | authorlink=Martin Bryant (programmer) | accessdate=2008-05-22 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317160439/http://www.colossusgames.co.uk/chess/whiteknight.htm | archivedate=2015-03-17 }}</ref> as a basis. It was developed on an [[Apple II]], but was first commercially released for [[Commodore 64]] as ''Colossus Chess 2.0'' ([[CDS Micro Systems]], 1984). A number of releases for 8-bit microcomputers followed. Version 3.0 was released in 1984 for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] (published by [[English Software]]), followed by 4.0 in 1985 which was released on most formats of the day (published by CDS). As other games of the time, the [[Acorn Electron]] implementation required that part of the screen memory be used as working space.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=New Chess grandmaster for the Beeb? (Colossus 4 review)|volume=5|issue=9|journal=Beebug|date=March 1987|page=12|author=Bernard Hill|quote=The manual indicates that the program version which loads in to a Model B or Electron is different to that for the Master or B+, and the board display shows this very clearly. The 32k program displays less than a full mode 4 screen as the program loads right up to %6040 [Mode 4's screen memory starts at %5800]}}</ref>

''Colossus Chess'' featured [[time control|time-control]]led play with [[game clock]]s, an opening book with 3,000 positions, and [[chess problem|problem]]-solving mode that could solve normal mates, [[selfmate]]s and [[helpmate]]s.<ref name="manual">{{cite book | url=http://www.secarica.ro/zx/colossus.html | title=Colossus Chess 4 for Sinclair ZX Spectrum | publisher=[[CDS Software]] | accessdate=2008-06-02}} (product manual)</ref> Pondering on opponent's time and a three-dimensional [[chessboard]] were introduced in ''Colossus Chess 4.0''. All releases were written in the [[assembly language]] of the appropriate [[CPU]];<ref name="Colossus"/> the [[ZX Spectrum]] version could examine an average of 170 positions per second.<ref name="manual"/>

Uncommon for microcomputer chess programs of the era, ''Colossus'' had a full implementation of the [[rules of chess]], including [[underpromotion]], the [[fifty-move rule]], [[draw by repetition]], and [[draw (chess)|draw]] by insufficient material.<ref name="manual"/> ''Colossus'' was also able to execute all the basic [[checkmate]]s, including the difficult [[bishop and knight checkmate]].<ref name="manual"/>

===''Colossus Chess X''===

The program was subsequently ported to [[Atari ST]] (1988), [[Amiga]] (1989) and [[IBM PC]] (1990) under the title ''Colossus Chess X''. The new releases featured four chess sets<ref name="ST-Log">{{cite journal | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/st-log/issue35/11_3_ST_NEWS_MORE_FROM_ARTWORX.php | title=More from Artworx | journal=ST-Log | issue=35 |date=August 1989 |page=11 | accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> and enhanced graphics developed with the assistance of Gary Thomlinson and Carl Cropley.<ref name="Colossus"/> The opening book was extended to 11,000 positions, and the program had the ability to learn from past playing experiences.<ref name="ST-Log"/>

===UCI version===
No work was done on ''Colossus Chess'' from 1991 to 2005, when Martin Bryant created a completely new and freely available Windows version conforming to the [[Universal Chess Interface]].<ref name="Colossus UCI">{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319133423/http://www.colossusgames.co.uk/chess/colossuschessuci.htm |url=http://www.colossusgames.co.uk/chess/colossuschessuci.htm |archive-date=19 March 2016 | title=Colossus Chess UCI | first=Martin | last=Bryant | authorlink=Martin Bryant (programmer)| accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref> It was written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], then converted to [[C (programming language)|C]] for speed, and was finally publicly released in 2006.<ref name="Colossus UCI"/> {{As of|2009|1}}, the latest version is 2008b.<ref name="Colossus UCI"/>

==Reception==
''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'' gave ''Colossus Chess IV'' for the Commodore 64 three stars out of five, stating that it was less attractive but "a darn sight more playable" than ''[[Chessmaster 2000]]'' with both keyboard and joystick controls. The magazine warned of the difficulty of remembering the "shifted keyboard control sequences" and said it was "badly in need of a quick-reference card".<ref name="info198701">{{Cite magazine |last=Dunnington |first=Benn |last2=Brown |first2=Mark R. |last3=Malcolm |first3=Tom |date=January–February 1987 |title=64/128 Gallery |url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n13/mode/2up |magazine=Info |pages=14–21}}</ref>
