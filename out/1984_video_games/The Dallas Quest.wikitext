'''''The Dallas Quest''''' is a [[graphic adventure game]] based on the television soap opera ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''. The game was programmed by James Garon for the [[TRS-80  Color Computer]] and published by [[Tandy Corporation]] in 1984.<ref name=boyle/> It was the second game in the "Animated Adventure" series, following ''[[The Sands of Egypt]]'', and uses the same split-screen display.<ref name=boyle/>  [[Datasoft]] published versions for the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], and [[Commodore 64]] in the same year.

The player takes the role of a detective. After an initial sequence at [[Southfork Ranch]], the setting moves to South America, and the game has little to do with the TV show.

==Development==
[[Lorimar Television|Lorimar Productions]], the studio that produced ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', licensed the rights to its characters to [[Datasoft]] and provided a script by two "screenwriter's assistants" for the show. James Garon adapted the script into a [[interactive fiction|text adventure game]], with graphics provided by professional artists.<ref name="springer198404">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_04_1984-04_Ion_International_US#page/n47/mode/2up | title=Who Programmed J.R.? | work=Ahoy! | date=April 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Springer, Steve | pages=49}}</ref>

==Reception== 
A five star ''[[Your Commodore]]'' review praised the graphics as some of the best in the genre, though they "take a long time to be reproduced." The reviewer disliked the sparse use of music and was not impressed with the music that does exist. Overall, it was called "one of the best games out on the CBM 64."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/02-your-commodore-magazine/Your_Commodore_Issue_02_1984_Nov#page/n31/mode/2up|title = Your Commodore Magazine Issue 02|date = November 1984}}</ref>

[[Arnie Katz]] concluded a 1984 ''[[Electronic Games]]'' review with, "Once you get past the fact that ''Dallas Quest'' isn't very closely tied to the show, it turns out to be somewhat entertaining and reasonably challenging."<ref name="katz">{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Arnie |title=Computer Gaming: Dallas Quest |journal=Electronic Games |date=October 1984 |volume=2 |issue=15 |pages=56,58 |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_02_Number_15_1984-10_Reese_Communications_US/page/n55}}</ref>
