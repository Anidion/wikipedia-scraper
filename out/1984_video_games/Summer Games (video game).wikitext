'''''Summer Games''''' is a [[sports video game]] developed and published by [[Epyx]] based on sports from the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. Released in 1984 for the [[Commodore 64]], it was [[ported]] to the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], and [[Master System]].

In the UK, the game was first released by [[Quicksilva]]<ref name='yourcommodore' /> and subsequently by [[U.S. Gold]] who later created versions for the [[Amiga]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Atari ST]] for inclusion in compilations. In 2004 it was re-released on the [[C64 Direct-to-TV]].

''Summer Games'' was the first in Epyx's ''Games'' series which continued with: ''[[Summer Games II]]'', ''[[Winter Games]]'', ''[[World Games (video game)|World Games]]'', ''[[California Games]]'', ''[[California Games II]]'', ''The Games: Summer Edition'', and ''The Games: Winter Edition.

==Gameplay==

The game is presented as a virtual multi-sport competition called the "Epyx Games" (there was no official [[IOC]] licensing in place) with up to eight players each choosing a country to represent, and then taking turns competing in various events to try for a medal. A score of 5:3:1 is used â€” gold medals 5 points, silver medals 3 points, and bronze medals 1 point.<ref name="summergamesepyx">{{cite AV media notes|url=http://www.c64sets.com/details.html?id=210|title=Summer Games|author=Epyx|author-link=Epyx|type=instruction manual|year=1984|location=Sunnyvale, California|access-date=2016-08-20}}</ref> On most versions, world records can be saved to the [[floppy disk]].

The Commodore 64 version allows players to link ''Summer Games'' and ''[[Summer Games II]]'' to engage in one large Olympics, accumulating medals in a tournament from both games.

===Events===
The events available vary slightly depending on the platform, and include [[pole vault]], [[diving (sport)|platform diving]], [[sprint (running)|sprinting]], [[gymnastics]], [[freestyle swimming]], and [[skeet shooting]].<ref name='yourcommodore' />

The game allows the player to compete in all of the events sequentially, choose a few events, choose just one event, or practice an event.<ref name='yourcommodore' />

==Development==
The inspiration for ''Summer Games'' came from the [[Starpath Supercharger]] game ''Sweat! The Decathlon Game''.<ref name="Retro Gamer">{{cite magazine |last=Milne |first=Rory |date=July 2021 |title=The Evolution of Summer |issue=222 |page=34 |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref> It was inspired by earlier titles like [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Olympic Decathlon]]''. While ''Sweat!'' was still in development Epyx purchased the ailing Starpath company. Work on the game was halted, because of the [[video game crash of 1983]]. All in-development Supercharger games were canceled and existing Supercharger inventory was liquidated but several developers at Starpath moved to Epyx including ''Sweat!'' programmer Scott Nelson. Work was started on a new decathlon game for the Commodore 64 named ''Summer Games''. Scott Nelson  worked on it and ''[[Summer Games II]]''.

==Reception==
Epyx sold more than 250,000 copies of ''Summer Games'' by November 1989;<ref name=gpsales>{{cite journal| author=Staff |title=Chart-Busters; SPA Platinum |date=November 1989 |issue=5| journal=[[Game Players]] | page=112}}</ref> ''[[Ahoy!]]'' described it as "tremendously successful".<ref name="kunkel198511">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_23_1985-11_Ion_International_US#page/n53/mode/2up | title=Summer Games II | work=Ahoy! | date=November 1985 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Kunkel, Bill | pages=49}}</ref> As the first of Epyx's "Games" series, it founded what a historian later described as "the most sustainedly popular in the long life of the Commodore 64", the most popular home computer of the mid-1980s.<ref name="maher20150619">{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2015/06/the-evolution-of-the-epyx-games/ | title=The Evolution of the (Epyx) Games | publisher=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2015-06-19 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref>

In 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' listed the "Games" series collectively as number 89 on its "Top 100 Games of All Time". The magazine wrote that though the games had great graphics for their time, their most defining qualities were their competitive multiplayer modes and "level of control that has yet to be equaled".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 100 Games of All Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=September 1996|page=39}}</ref> In a retrospective review, Atari 7800 Forever gave only a 2.0 out of 5, criticizing the boring events.<ref name="Funkmaster V">{{cite web |last1= Funkmaster V |title=REVIEW: Summer Games |website=Atari 7800 Forever |url=http://www.atari7800forever.com/summergamesr.html}}</ref>
