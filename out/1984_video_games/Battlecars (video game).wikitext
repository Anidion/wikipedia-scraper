'''''Battlecars''''' is a [[vehicular combat game]] released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> It is based on [[Games Workshop]]'s [[Miniature wargaming|miniature wargame]], ''[[Battlecars]].'' The game is set in 2084 in a future where road accidents have been eliminated by technology, and the world is relatively bloodless; however, people now entertain themselves by drivers using 20th century automobiles in violent, gladiatorial contests.<ref name=":1" />

== Gameplay ==
Up to two players battle each other or the computer with vehicles that use an assortment of armor, weapons, and other components including missiles, mines, machine guns, lasers, oil, and smoke.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Wade|first=Bob|date=February 1985|title=Screen Test - Spectrum - Battlecars|url=https://archive.org/stream/Personal_Computer_Games_Issue15#page/n31/mode/2up/search/battlecars|journal=[[Personal Computer Games]]|pages=32|via=Archive.org}}</ref> Players can fight their cars on a racetrack, in an arena (the Autodrome), or on the streets of Slug City.<ref name=":0" /> On the racetrack, players navigate through a narrow circuit, competing primarily against rough terrain and a clock.<ref name=":0" /> The Autodrome is a bare arena where two cars can focus on battling each other.<ref name=":0" /> Slug City is a townscape where cars could battle each other on narrow streets.<ref name=":0" />  A player can play against the computer or a second player in either the racetrack or Autodrome; however, players can only play each other in Slug City.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="crash92" />

Except for when racing on the racetrack, the primary goal of the game is to find your opponent and destroy their car.<ref name="crash92" /> Players can take advantage of gas stations and service garages to obtain fuel or repairs, but using either makes a player vulnerable to attack from their opponent.<ref name="crash92" /> A notable gameplay element at the time of the game's release in 1984 was that cars would realistically "drift" when they tried to turn at a high speed.<ref name="crash92" />

When playing a game, players are presented a screen that shows the area in which they are driving their car, a map of the entire venue, the current speed and fuel of their car, any damage it receives, and information about available weapons.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="crash92" /> When there are two players, each player has their own playing screen on the computer monitor.<ref name="crash92" /> The game is played using twelve keys on a keyboard to control each car and its weapons.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />  The game has eight car configurations from which players could choose.<ref name=":0" /> ''Battlecars'' also comes with a program, ''Designer'', which allows players to customize the vehicles they want to use in battle.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

==Development==
[[File:Battlecars.gif|thumb|right|alt=|Loading screen]]

''Battlecars'' was developed for the [[ZX Spectrum]] by SLUG (a [[Harlow]] co-operative of programmers who formerly worked for [[Red Shift (publisher)|Red Shift]]) using [[BASIC]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|date=January 1985|title=Reviews - Battlecars|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-and-videogames-039/ComputerAndVideoGames_039_Jan_1985#page/n19/mode/2up/search/battlecars|journal=[[Computer and Video Games]]|volume=39|pages=20 & 25|via=Archive.org}}</ref><ref name="crash92">[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/09/gw.htm "From Tin Soldiers to Computer Games"]; ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' issue 9, October 1984; retrieved from CRASH The Online Edition</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url=https://www.retrogamer.net/profiles/developer/julian-gollop/|title=Julian Gollop {{!}} Retro Gamer|access-date=2017-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|date=October 1988|title=Reviews - Battlecars|url=https://archive.org/details/your-sinclair-34|journal=[[Your Sinclair]]|volume=34|pages=95|via=Archive.org}}</ref> [[Julian Gollop]] notably developed the ''Designer'' program which allows players to edit the cars in the game.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":12" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-11-28-the-story-of-x-com-interview|title=The Story of X-Com|last=Bickham|first=Al|date=2010-11-28|website=Eurogamer|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-06-17}}</ref> [[Games Workshop]] released ''Battlecars'' as a computer game for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="crash92" /> The game came with a sixteen-page instruction manual.<ref name=":1" /> Summit Software re-released the game in 1988.<ref name=":2" />

==Reception==
Roger Kean previewed ''Battlecars'' in ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' #9 (October 1984), calling it "rather more straightforward than one would expect from a company so immersed in the occult", and described the handling of the game's high speed vehicles "quite alarmingly realistic".<ref name="crash92"/>

Kevin Westbury reviewed ''Battlecars'' for ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' #60, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that "All in all, ''Battlecars'' is fast, furious and great fun, and manages to combine simple operations with quite complex play, where only the best drivers and the surest shots will survive."<ref name="WD60">{{cite journal  | last =Westbury | first =Kevin | title =Microview  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | issue =60  | pages =30â€“31  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  | date = December 1984  }}</ref>

Representative of the game's positive reception, Bob Wade reviewed ''Battlecars'' for ''[[Personal Computer Games]]'', calling the game "a bleak view of an automative future but terrific to play".<ref name=":0" /> 

Representative of the game's negative reception, ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' was critical of ''Battlecars'', saying "It's one thing to have a good idea for a game, but another one to actually write the program."<ref name=":1" /> ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' elaborated on this criticism a few years later by noting "the horrid thing kept crashing on me."<ref name=":2" />
