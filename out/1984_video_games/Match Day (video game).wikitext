'''''Match Day''''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[computer game]], published by [[Ocean Software]] in 1984 for the [[ZX Spectrum]]. It is the first game in the [[Match Day (series)|''Match Day'' series]], and was the creation of programmer [[Jon Ritman]] and Chris Clarke.<ref name='ritmancrash33'>{{cite magazine |title=From Namtir Raiders, To A Bit Of Bovver With Bears Then On To Batman...

==Background==
Jon Ritman met Chris Clarke, formerly of [[Crystal Computing]], at [[Artic Computing]] in 1983 where Clarke was marketing ''[[Bear Bovver]]'', Ritman's latest game for the company.<ref name='ritmancrash33' /> They decided on going freelance to produce a football game after discovering that distributors wanted to see a ZX Spectrum game comparable to ''[[International Soccer]]'' on the Commodore 64.<ref name=oceanthehistory>{{Cite book|last1=Wilkins|first1=Chris|title=Ocean - The History|last2=Kean|first2=Roger M|publisher=Revival Retro Events|year=2013}}</ref>{{rp|209}} By chance Ritman met David Ward, co-founder of [[Ocean Software]], at a computer show and told him what he was working on. Several months later Ward called Ritman and offered him a Â£20,000 advance for the game which he accepted immediately.<ref name='retrogamer59'>{{cite magazine |title=In The Chair with Jon Ritman|magazine=Retro Gamer|issue=59|publisher=Imagine|date=2 January 2009|page=25-31|url=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=oceanthehistory />{{rp|209}} Ocean licensed the theme tune from ''[[Match of the Day]]'' from the [[BBC]] but not the title,<ref name='rghistoryofmatchday' /><ref name=oceanthehistory />{{rp|41}} naming it ''Match Day'' instead.
==Gameplay==
[[image:Match Day Goal.png|thumb|left|ZX Spectrum version]]
This was the first soccer game for the ZX Spectrum where large moving footballers characters could dribble, throw-in, take corners, etc. The game uses modified sprites from a Ritman's previous title ''[[Bear Bovver]]'' to create an almost isometric, but still ultimately side-on football title.<ref>[http://zxgoldenyears.net/sport.html Sport Games review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217011803/http://zxgoldenyears.net/sport.html |date=2008-02-17}} at zxgoldenyears.net</ref>

The game has 8 teams that the player can choose, such as ''Ritman Rovers'', ''Clarke PR'' and ''Ocean United''. Players can rename the teams and redefine the team colours.

==Reception==
''Match Day'' was released in late 1984 and became a best-seller over the Christmas period reaching number 2 in the charts<ref name='matchdaycharts'>{{cite magazine |title=Top 20 Software Compiled By Gallup|magazine=Home Computing Weekly|issue=95|publisher=Argus Specialist Publications|date=15 January 1985|page=43|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2661&page=43|access-date=27 October 2022}}</ref> behind ''[[Ghostbusters (1984 video game)|Ghostbusters]]''.

== Legacy ==
The sequel, ''[[Match Day II]]'' was much the same but incorporated two features still used today in most football titles - a deflection system, the ball could bounce off players, which meant headers were possible, and a shot power system, although it was as easy to accidentally backheel the ball with this system, as it was to hit a powerful shot. The game is also similar to a previously, not published game by Jon Ritman, ''Soccerama''.<ref name=amstradmuseuminterview>{{Cite web |url=http://perso.wanadoo.es/amstradcpc/interviews/ritman.html |title=Interview with Ritman at amstradmuseum.com |access-date=2010-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607085726/http://perso.wanadoo.es/amstradcpc/interviews/ritman.html |archive-date=2009-06-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Later, in 1995, Jon Ritman tried to release ''Match Day III'', but the name of the game was changed to ''[[Super Match Soccer]]'' to avoid any potential legal issues.<ref name=amstradmuseuminterview />
