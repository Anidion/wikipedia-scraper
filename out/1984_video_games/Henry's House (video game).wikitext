In ''Henry's House'', the player guides Henry through the numerous rooms of the house. Each room in is filled with deadly household items like: toothbrushes, toasters, kettles and coffee makers. Touching one of these objects kills Henry. Falling from too great a height has a similar effect.

The goal is to reach the exit of each room. To do so, Henry must find the key, which appears only after some particular action is taken, and gather all the items that are scattered around the room.
