''Fortune Builder'' is a simulation of a real estate business. Players acquire land to develop into valuable properties by constructing buildings, including accommodation, restaurants, and resorts, represented by icons on a two-dimensional map. The value of constructed properties is modified by the terrain buildings are constructed on, with effects differing across beachfront, lakefront, grass and snow-capped land. The player also builds utilities to service their properties, such as power stations to fuel industries, and roads and gas stations to maintain traffic. Players must consider several factors that modify business success, including proximity to undesirable buildings, the preferences of consumers, and seasonal patterns. The game features a yearly calendar, with information about financial performance displayed at the end of the year. The game's single-player mode lasts five calendar years. The game also features a split-screen two-player mode, which lasts until one player wins.<ref name=EG/><ref>{{cite book|title=Fortune Builder: Strategy Guide|publisher=Coleco Family Learning Software|date=1984|url=https://archive.org/details/fortune-builder-game-manual-coleco-vision-adam-1984}}</ref>

==Reception==

''Electronic Games'' praised the game as a "quality" title, noting its graphics were "colourful, well-drawn and easy to understand", with "pretty" music, although found the one-player mode to be "little more than a basic economics lesson".<ref name=EG>{{cite magazine|magazine=Electronic Games|volume=3|issue=2|date=February 1985|publisher=Reese Communications|last=Forman|first=Tracie|title=Fortune Builder|pages=36|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_03_Number_02_1985-02_Reese_Communications_US/page/n35}}</ref> ''[[Computer Entertainer]]'' nominated the game as the 1984 'Program of the Year' for the [[Colecovision]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]]|volume=3|issue=10|date=January 1985|title=Computer Entertainer Awards of Excellence 1984|pages=147|url=https://archive.org/details/computer-entertainer-3-10/page/146}}</ref> Retrospective reception of ''Fortune Builder'' has identified the game as an early precursor to the later [[Maxis]] simulation series ''[[Sim City]]''. ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' listed the game as one of the "perfect" titles for the system, writing "predating ''[[Sim City]]'' by a good five years, ''Fortune Builder'' is an extremely polished sim", highlighting the game's "staggering range of items" and "insanely polished" two-player mode.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Retro Gamer|title=Perfect Ten: Colecovision|pages=74|issue=73|publisher=Imagine Publishing|date=February 2010|url=https://archive.org/details/retro-gamer-raspberry-pi-buenos-aires/Retro%20Gamer%20073}}</ref> Considering the game to have inspired ''Sim City'',<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Digital Press|issue=7|date=September 1992|title=Closet Classics|pages=21|url=https://archive.org/details/Digital_Press_Issue_07_1992-09_Santulli_Joe_US/page/n19}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Digital Press|title=Psychophile|last=Santulli|first=Joe|pages=21|issue=23|date=January 1995|url=https://archive.org/details/Digital_Press_Issue_23_1995-01_Santulli_Joe_US/page/n19}}</ref> ''Digital Press'' described the title as "very advanced for its time",<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Digital Press|issue=33|date=September 1997|title=Digital Press Presents: Our 99 Favorite Classics|pages=11|url=https://archive.org/details/Digital_Press_Issue_33_1997-09_Santulli_Joe_US/page/n9}}</ref> although noted that the game "isn't visually appealing and would probably impress only the diehard strategiests because of its lumbering pace".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Digital Press|pages=17|last=Oleniacz|first=Kevin|title=Classic Sleepers|issue=29|date=March 1996|url=https://archive.org/details/Digital_Press_Issue_29_1996-03_Santulli_Joe_US/page/n15}}</ref>
