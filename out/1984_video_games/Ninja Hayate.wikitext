{{nihongo|'''''Ninja Hayate'''''|忍者ハヤテ}} is a [[1984 in video gaming|1984]] [[laserdisc video game]] first developed and released by [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] and [[Toei Company|Malone Films]] for [[arcade game|arcades]] in Japan<ref>{{KLOV game|id=8885|name=Ninja Hayate}}</ref> and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ninja Hayate|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/arcade/568363-ninja-hayate|publisher=[[GameFAQs]]|accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref> The game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to the [[Sega CD]] [[video game console]] as '''''Revenge of the Ninja''''' in 1994.

==Arcade game==
The game tells the story of a skilled and daring teenage [[ninja]] named Hayate, infiltrating an evil castle in an attempt to rescue a princess he loves.<ref>''[[GamePro]]'' 59 (June 1994)</ref> Hayate must survive a collection of deathtraps and defeat a variety of mythological creatures and other adversaries on his quest to save the princess and destroy the castle.

The game draws players to guide Hayate with a [[joystick]] for moving him around and one button for using weapons through 15 different stages that take place in [[feudal Japan]]-based areas. There are three difficulty levels.

Like earlier laserdisc games such as [[Don Bluth]]'s ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'', ''Ninja Hayate'' contains traps and creatures that requires players to dodge or attack them at specific moments, by watching for the warning buzzer (like ''Dragon's Lair'') in addition to flashing objects (e.g. arrows, buttons, light, etc.). If a player makes a mistake, one life decreases, and when players run out of lives, the game ends.

Unlike Don Bluth's laserdisc games, ''Ninja Hayate'' is animated with [[anime]] drawings by [[Toei Animation]]. Another difference is that the game flashes the buttons that need to be pressed directly on the screen. Sometimes it also flashes multiple possible button presses on screen, indicating different paths that the player can take. Another difference is that some traps are [[randomly generated]], so that the game is not identical every playthrough.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scullion|first1=Chris|title=The Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Encyclopedia: Every Game Released for Sega's 16-bit Console|date=8 December 2021|publisher=White Owl|isbn=978-1-5267-4662-7|page=250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-VVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA250|language=en}}</ref>

==Home versions==
The Sega CD version was published by [[Renovation Products]], [[Telenet Japan]]'s North American subsidiary. Renovation sent "Master of the Ninja Arts" diplomas to players who mailed them photographic proof that they had beaten the game on hard mode.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Buyers Beware|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=99|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1996|page=26}}</ref> ''Revenge of the Ninja'' was also later converted by Ecseco to the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. These versions were released only in Japan as part of a double bill with ''[[Time Gal]]'', another animated laserdisc arcade game conversion made by Taito, as '''''Interactive Movie Action - Time Gal and Ninja Hayate'''''.<ref>[http://www.segagagadomain.com/saturn5/inter-timeninja.htm Interactive Movie Action - Time Gal & Ninja Hayate]</ref>

In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Ninja Hayate'' on their January 15, 1985 issue as being the fourth most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=252|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 January 1985|page=27|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19850115p.pdf#page=14}}</ref> The following month, it was the top-grossing upright/cockpit arcade unit in [[1985 in video games|February 1985]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Best Hit Games 25|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=253|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 February 1985|page=25|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19850201p.pdf#page=13}}</ref>

''[[GamePro]]'' gave the Sega CD version a mixed review, considering the game to be inferior to ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'' and ''[[Time Gal]]'' with the gameplay lacking in "dramatics" and with "grainy and soupy looking" graphics. They said players "won't be disappointed" if they "like these types of games" but if they don't, they should avoid the game.<ref name="GamePro">{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Revenge of the Ninja|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=69|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1994|page=50}}</ref> The five reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave it a 32 out of 50 (8, 7, 5, 6 and 6 out of 10), commenting that the gameplay relies more on memorization than anything else. Although positive to game's animation, they said that it is more a treat to watch than to play.<ref name="EGM">{{cite magazine|title=Review Crew: Revenge of the Ninja|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=60|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=July 1994|page=38}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The original arcade version had no music except opening and ending theme. Entire music played on the Sega CD version were newly composed.
