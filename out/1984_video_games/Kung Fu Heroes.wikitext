==Plot==

==Gameplay==

The player controls one of the characters, Jacky or Lee, and each level pits the player against countless enemy warriors. The goal is for the player to defeat enough enemies so that the door at the top of the room opens allowing the player to exit the room and proceed to the next. Enemies' attacks and weapons vary throughout the game. There are quite a number of ''BONUS'' levels that players can enter.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Chinese Hero'' on their [[1984 in video games|October 15, 1984]] issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=246|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 October 1984|page=31|lang=ja}}</ref>
