{{nihongo|'''''Urban Champion'''''|アーバンチャンピオン}} is a [[fighting game|fighting]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] in 1984. It was first released for the Famicom and [[Nintendo VS. System]] for arcades in 1984, and later released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America and Europe in 1986. It was inspired by the 1984 [[Game & Watch]] game ''[[List of Game & Watch games|Boxing]]'' (also known as ''[[Punch-Out!!]]''). It is Nintendo's first 2D [[fighting game]], eventually followed in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] by ''[[Joy Mech Fight]]'', released exclusively in Japan for the Famicom.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Urbanchamp2.jpeg|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot]]
The objective is to knock the other player into a [[sewer manhole]]. There is a 99-second time limit, and the player has a set limit of stamina (200 hit points). The player has two types of attacks: a light punch and a heavy punch. The light punch is weaker but faster and harder to block, while the heavy punch is stronger, but takes longer to pull off, is more easily telegraphed, and is thus easier to block.

Each punch costs the player 1 HP. Flower pots are occasionally dropped from windows, which will cost a fighter 5 HP and daze the fighter if they hit. When a player is knocked off the pavement, they advance to the next street. After every third fight, the opponent is knocked into a manhole, then the player has a brief celebration where a lady throws [[confetti]] from a window. The goal of the game is to reach the rank of Champion. Every three fights won, the player gets a specific symbol on the lower right corner; after five symbols are earned, they go to the next set of symbols. After 45 symbols (135 fights), they get the rank of Champion. In addition, a police car may pass by the fighting at any point in the fight which causes the players to return to their starting positions. If the timer runs out, the police will arrest the player closest to being knocked off of the pavement, meaning it is a default win for the other player for that round.

The two fighters are named Ron Imhoff and Alan Mussman respectively, according to an interview in 1989 by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] where he explained the names were a running joke during production of the game amongst the designers based on two designers pseudonyms.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} As was typical of video games at the time, the two fighters are just palette swaps of each other. The game does not contain any traditional scoring system

==Reception==
Most reviews gave it negative ratings. In the special edition ''Pak Source'' included on the January/February 1990 volume of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', which rated all the NES games released in North America from October 1985 to March 1990, ''Urban Champion'' received (out of 5) scores of 2.5, 2.5, 1.5, and 1.5 for the four categories evaluated.<ref name="Pak Source"/> Along with ''[[Chubby Cherub]]'', it is one of the only two games to obtain a score below 2 in a category.<ref name="Pak Source">{{cite magazine|title=Pak Source|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=January 1990}}</ref> Contemporary reviews upon the game's arrival on the Virtual Console were not better.
