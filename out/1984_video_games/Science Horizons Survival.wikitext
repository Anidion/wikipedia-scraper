'''''Science Horizons Survival''''' is a [[ZX Spectrum]] [[video game]] developed by Five Ways Software. It was published by [[Sinclair Research]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Education]] in [[1984 in video gaming|1984]].<ref>{{WoS game|id=0005080|name=Survival}}</ref> It is an [[educational game]] in which the player takes on the role of one of a series of animals, and had to find food to survive while avoiding predators.

==Gameplay==

The aim was to teach users about [[food chain]]s; as an insect life is short, with the constant danger of being eaten by a bird - but as an eagle the player is at the top of the food chain with [[hunting|mankind]] or [[starvation]] as the only dangers.

The simulation allows the player to be one of six animals: a [[hawk]], a [[European robin|robin]], a [[lion]], a [[mouse]], a [[fly]] or a [[butterfly]]. The world appears in scrolling grid form, with ice caps to the north and south. The player moves one square at a time, with visibility depending on the chosen animal, avoiding predators and find food and water. The game ends when the animal dies, either through starvation, dehydration, being killed by a predator, or old age.

==Development==
''Survival'' was developed as part of a series of educational software aimed at children aged between 5 and 12. This "Science Horizons" series was instigated by [[Sir Clive Sinclair]] and ex-Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=March 1984 |title=Sinclair News |journal=ZX Computing |issue=8402  |pages=83  }}</ref>

==Reception==
''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' magazine described ''Survival'' as an interesting and enjoyable program which can be used to reinforce learning, or on a self-discovery basis. One criticism was difficulty in remembering the control keys.<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 1985 |title=A Little Learning for the Festive Season? |journal=CRASH |issue=24 |pages=137 }}</ref>
