'''''Oh Mummy''''' is a [[video game]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]] models of [[home computer]]. It was developed by Gem Software<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/crash-magazine-01 |title=Crash Magazine Issue 01 |date=February 1984 |publisher=Newsfield Publications Ltd. |year=1984 |location=UK |pages=34 |language=en}}</ref> and published by [[Amsoft]] in 1984.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023|reason=Couldn't find any mention of this publisher in several magazine reviews and adverts}} It was often included in the free bundles of software that came with the computer. The gameplay is similar to that of the 1981 arcade game ''[[Amidar]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}}

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to unveil all of the treasure within each level (or pyramid) of the game whilst avoiding the [[Mummy|mummies]]. Each level consists of a two-dimensional board. In contrast with ''[[Pac-Man]]'', when the player's character walks around, footprints are left behind. By surrounding an area of the [[maze]] with footprints, its content is revealed, which is either a [[scroll]], a [[mummy]], a [[lock and key|key]], a [[tomb]] or nothing at all. In order to complete a level, it is necessary to unveil the key and a tombstone. The scroll enables the player to kill/eat one mummy on the level. If a mummy is unveiled, it follows the player to the next level. The difficulty and speed of the game increases as the player progresses through the levels.

The game is primarily for one player but has a limited multiplayer mode in which players can alternate taking a turn to play each level. Whilst, even at the time, it was considered simple in terms of [[gameplay]], graphics and sound, it was for many people one of the better and more addictive early offerings for the Amstrad.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The music played during gameplay is based on the children's song "[[The Streets of Cairo, or the Poor Little Country Maid]]".

==Ports==
The game was also released for the [[MSX]], [[ZX Spectrum]], the [[Amstrad CPC 464]], [[Tatung Einstein]] and [[Camputers Lynx]]. The ZX Spectrum version was given away in one of several introductory software packs for the computer, this particular pack also including ''Crazy Golf'', ''Alien Destroyer'', ''Punchy'', ''[[Treasure Island (1984 video game)|Treasure Island]]'' and ''Disco Dan''.  The game was also unofficially ported to the Sega Genesis and Mattel Intelevision.
