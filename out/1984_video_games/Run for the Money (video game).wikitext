'''''Run for the Money''''' is a two-player [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] developed by [[Tom Snyder Productions]] and published by Scarborough Systems in 1984 for [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Commodore 64]], [[IBM PC]], and [[Macintosh]]. The players have crash-landed their spaceships on an alien planet and compete to buy resources and convert them to goods to sell to locals in order to raise funds to repair their ships.

==Overview==
The players take the roles of two aliens called Bizlings who have crash-landed their Proto-Ruf Ships on the planet Simian after flying through a zinger storm. The zinger storm has removed the paint from the ships' protective shields. The two players purchase raw materials called Rufs from aliens called Ruffians and use a machine on their ships to convert the Rufs into Synannas, which they sell to local aliens called Simians. Players can purchase low, medium, or high quality rufs, set the price of their Synannas, and spend money on advertising. The goal is to generate enough profit to purchase paint to repair the ship's protective shield and launch through the Simian atmosphere. The game ends when a player successfully launches.<ref>{{cite book
