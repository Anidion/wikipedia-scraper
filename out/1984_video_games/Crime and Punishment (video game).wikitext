'''''Crime and Punishment''''' is a legal simulation video game developed by [[Imagic]] and published for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]] in 1984. [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]] released a port for [[IBM PC compatibles]] the same year.

==Gameplay==
The player assumed the role of a sentencing judge in a [[criminal law]] matter before the courts.

Information available to the player included details on the nature of the crime committed, the defendants prior criminal history and pre-sentencing reports.

The player could also review known facts relating to the case before sentencing the prisoner to [[probation]], [[County jail|jail]], [[prison]] or even choose the [[death penalty]] in [[murder]] cases.

In the case of imprisonment, the player also chose the length of prison term.

Scoring was related to how closely the sentence handed out by the player matched that of what a real life judge decided in the case; the player was penalized for asking irrelevant questions.

On pirated editions, the game had only one kind of case, software piracy, and the only available sentence was death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}
