'''''Illusions''''' (stylized as '''''illusions''''') is a surreal [[puzzle video game]] published by [[Coleco]] for its [[ColecoVision]] console in 1984. The player maneuvers blobs around the screen, trying to get them to merge, or, alternatively, split apart. At times, lizards may chase the blobs around. A water bucket, when spilled, can cause the lizard to turn into a fish. If the fish remains there too long, however, it turns into a bird. The game was created by [[Nice Ideas]], a division of [[Mattel]] that was located midway between Cannes and Nice.
