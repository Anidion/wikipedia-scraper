The player uses a [[visual programming language]] to teach a virtual robot how to navigate various mazes of varying difficulty. The game straddles the line between entertainment and programming education.

==Development==
The game was developed using the MacFORTH implementation of the [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] programming language for the [[Macintosh 128K]].

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' preferred ''[[Robot Odyssey]]'' to ''ChipWits'' but stated that both were "incredibly vivid simulation experiences". The magazine criticized ''ChipWits''{{'}} inability to save more than 16 robots or copy a robot to a new save slot, and cautioned that it "may be too simple for people familiar with programming". The magazine added that the criticism was "more a cry for a more complex Chipwits II game than condemnation of the current product".<ref name="williams19850405">{{cite magazine | title=Robot Simulations / Tinkerer's Playgrounds | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | date=April–May 1985 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1985&pub=2&id=21 | accessdate=17 April 2016 | last=Williams | first=Gregg | pages=22–23}}</ref>

==Legacy==
From 2006 to 2008, Mike Johnston and Doug Sharp developed and released ''ChipWits II'', written in [[Adobe AIR]]. That version featured several innovations including an in-game tutorial, updated graphics, a soundtrack, [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric]] and 3D rendering, several new chips, and new missions. That version is no longer supported, but the original site is archived at [https://web.archive.org/web/20190804143146/http://chipwits.com/].

In September 2021, ChipWits, Inc. was formed by Doug Sharp and Mark Roth to create a modern reboot of the game. The new version is being written in [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] and is in early access testing.<ref>[https://chipwits.com/ Official website]</ref>
