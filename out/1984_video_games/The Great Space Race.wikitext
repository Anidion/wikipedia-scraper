'''''The Great Space Race''''' is a [[ZX Spectrum]] space-based combat and adventure game published in 1984 by British studio Legend.

== Gameplay ==
''The Great Space Race'' is a combination role-playing game and science-fiction space combat game.  The basic premise of the game is that a new super-drink called Natof has been discovered.  Natof has three key properties, which are to get the person drunk, never leave him with a hangover, and supply him with all the nutrition required from a well-balanced (if never sober) diet.

The name '''Natof''' is a [[portmanteau]] of the phrase "'''NA'''me '''TO''' '''F'''ollow" - the sentence sent with the first batch of miracle drink by the discoverer.

The manual describes the game as "a true computer movie.  The player can just watch events unfold, joining in as much or as little as he wishes."  The objective is "to deliver, to the space stations as much Natof as the player can, as fast as he can."  The game will play itself if left alone — indeed the computer generally makes a better player than a human does — although that rather defeats the point of the game.

== Development ==
The publishing house Legend was also known as Microl/Legend, and earlier as simply Microl. Legend's chairman and founder was John Peel. The developers of ''The Great Space Race'' credited in the instruction manual are David Ashe, Graham Asher, Martin Carty, Karl Curtis, Richard Edwards, [[Trevor Inns]], Declan Kirk, James Learmont, Adrian Marler, Bruce Menzie, Peter Moxham, Andrew Owen, Jan Peel, and John Peel. The publisher claimed an investment of £250,000 for the title.<ref>Mike Gerrard: ''Adventuring into an Unknown World.'' In: The Guardian, 1984-08-30, section Micro Guardian/Futures, page 13.</ref>

== Reception ==
''The Great Space Race'' was anticipated as the follow-up to Legend's graphic adventure ''[[Valhalla (video game)|Valhalla]]''. Pre-release publicity boasted that the game contained "technical effects never before seen in home computer software", with "true solid 3D graphics".<ref>[http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr08/yr08_03.htm Your Spectrum, issue 08, October 1984]</ref> The game was largely coded in [[BASIC]].<ref>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue13/Pages/Crash1300119.jpg Crash, Issue 13, February 1985]</ref>

After its release, the game was described by ''[[Sinclair User]]'' as "one of the most vacuous products we have seen."<ref>[http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/036/sftwre.htm Sinclair User, March 1985]</ref> The graphics also did not impress, as [[Big K (magazine)|''Big K'']] magazine panned "Graphics are great - by 1982 standards. In 1985 they look amateurish and unprofessional".<ref>[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=BigK/Issue12/Pages/BigK1200023.jpg Big K, Issue 12, March 1985]</ref>  More recent retrospective reviews (c.2010s)  confirm ''The Great Space Race'' as a poor product that was greatly over-hyped.<ref>{{citation| url = http://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-great-space-race/| title = THE GREAT SPACE RACE| date = 24 August 2010| work = www.retrogamer.net}}</ref><ref>{{citation| url =https://leveluparchive.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/review-a-bad-game-day-the-great-space-race/| title = Review a Bad Game Day: The Great Space Race | date =  7 Aug 2012 | work = leveluparchive| type =Blog }}</ref>
