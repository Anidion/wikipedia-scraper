'''''Gremlins''''' is a 1984 [[video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Atari, Inc.]] for the [[Atari 2600]].<ref name="gamefaqs">{{cite web | url =https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/atari2600/584783-gremlins | title = Gremlins | publisher = [[GameFAQs]] | access-date = March 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Einhorn | first = Ethan | date = November 1, 2003 | title = History of horror games: With Halloween upon us, we've decided to take a look at horror's history in videogames | newspaper = [[GameNOW]] | page = 86}}</ref> It is a [[tie-in]] to the 1984 film ''[[Gremlins]]''. Atari released another, substantially different game based on the film for the [[Atari 5200]].<ref name=Weiss139>Weiss, p. 139.</ref>

== Gameplay ==

The 2600 game consists of two playable screens and can be played by one player or two players alternating turns. The first screen is similar to the 1981 game ''[[Kaboom! (video game)|Kaboom!]]''. The player controls protagonist Billy Peltzer, who runs side-to-side across the screen catching falling Mogwai to prevent them from eating hamburgers. In the second screen, similar to ''[[Space Invaders]]'', the player moves Billy back and forth across the screen and shoots waves of descending gremlins.<ref name=Weiss67>Weiss, p. 67.</ref>

== Development ==
''[[Gremlins]]'', directed by [[Joe Dante]], was the center of a major [[merchandising]] push in the months surrounding its release. Atari developed video game [[tie-in]]s for both of its contemporary consoles, the [[Atari 2600]] and the [[Atari 5200]]. The game was also the final game released for the 5200. Atari intended to release both along with the film in 1984, but the company stopped shipment of all its games after its reorganization that year.<ref name=MJ>{{cite news | title= You might have a rare game in your collection | author= Edward J.

== Reception ==
In retrospective reviews, Brett Weiss called it "derivative" and lacking in originality,<ref name=Weiss67/> and humorist [[Seanbaby]] criticized the premise of defending hamburgers from gremlins, calling it a "clumsily rearranged [[Hamburglar]] game".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/seanbaby-hate-1984s |title=Seanbaby's I Hate The 1984s from |publisher=1UP.com |access-date=2011-03-23}}</ref>
