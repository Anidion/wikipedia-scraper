}}'''''Draconian''''' is a [[multidirectional shooter]] released in 1984.  It was written by Mike Hughey and published via Tom Mix Software.  The game was initially released for [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] and converted for the [[Dragon 32/64]]. ''Draconian'' is based upon the arcade game ''[[Bosconian]]'' where the player navigates a ship through scrolling space to destroy enemy [[military base|bases]].<ref name=boyle/>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Draconian - game tandy Color computer - emulator.png|thumb|Little dragons attacking the player's ship]]

''Draconian'' adds some features to the ''Bosconian'' design:
#Bases contain [[prisoner]]s who can optionally be freed to gain more points.
#The space shuttle is attacked by little [[dragon]]s.
#There is one big indestructible dragon which chases the player when time is running out.
#The player needs to avoid [[Land mine|mines]] and [[asteroid]]s.

The user needs to destroy all bases to complete a level. If done, a small tunnel will open. The spaceship will explode when the borders of the tunnel are hit.  In case the user flies against the borders of the field, the space shuttle will bounce back.
