Reviewing ''Objective: Kursk'' for ''[[Electronic Games]]'', Neil Shapiro called it "a fine historical simulation". However, he considered it particularly dry, and "lack[ing] in a subjective 'feel' of fluidity, control and understandable challenge that I personally look for when I feel like gaming".<ref name=electricgames>{{cite journal | author=Shapiro, Neil | title=Articles of War; ''Objective: Kursk'' | volume=2 | journal=[[Electronic Games]] | number=17 | date=December 1984 | pages=56–58 }}</ref> In ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'', Dr. John F. Stanoch praised the recreation of the Battle of Kursk, but noted that "the game is long and might become tedious for some players."<ref name=antic />

In a ''[[Page 6]]'' survey of wargames for Atari computers, writer M. Evan Brooks placed ''Objective: Kursk'' in the "moribund" category. While he found it "extremely detailed", he argued that the end result was "bland" and hampered by a cumbersome interface.<ref name=page6>{{cite journal | author=Brooks, M. Evan | title=Wargames | journal=[[Page 6]] | issue=31 | date=January–February 1988 | pages=12–16 }}</ref> A wargame survey from the French magazine ''[[:fr:Jeux et Stratégie|Jeux et Stratégie]]'' declared, "More accessible than ''[[Reforger '88]]'' or ''[[War in Russia]]'', ''Objective: Kursk'' is still for real wargamers."<ref name=strategie /> ''[[Tilt (French magazine)|Tilt]]''{{'}}s 1986 wargame survey was also positive toward the game.<ref name=tilt />
