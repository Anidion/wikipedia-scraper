'''''Frogger II: ThreeeDeep!'''''{{efn|Promotional materials from Parker Brothers use capital "D" in the title.<ref name="frogger-ad"/>}} is a video game released in 1984 by [[Parker Brothers]] for the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[IBM PC compatible]]s. It is a sequel to the 1981 Konami ''[[Frogger]]'' arcade video game and has similar gameplay.

The goal of ''Frogger II'' is to maneuver each frog to a berth at the top of the screen.  Once all of the berths are filled, the player progresses to the next level. Unlike its predecessor, it has three consecutive screens for each level rather than one screen per level, with berths at the top of each of the three screens that need to be filled.

==Reception==
In a 1984 review of the Commodore 64 cartridge for ''[[Electronic Games]]'', Louise Kohl wrote, "Fans of the original will be very pleased with its successor, and newer fans will find it appealing and challenging as well. A year ago, before the rise of computer action games with their greater emphasis on strategy, this would have been a more exciting release."<ref name=kohl/>

Also writing for ''Electronic Games'', Ted Salamone was impressed that the Atari 2600 version "actually looks, plays, and sounds state of the art, all on the lowly 2600". He pointed out some flickering and difficult to distinguish objects, but still called the overall package "flawless".<ref name=salamone/> ''Computer Games'' gave the Atari 8-bit computer version an A rating, saying it "makes the original look like kid stuff".<ref name="CG1985">{{cite magazine |title=1985 Software Buyer's Guide |magazine=Computer Games |date=February 1985 |volume=3 |issue=5 |publisher=Carnegie Publications |location=United States |pages=11-8, 51-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Games_Vol_3_No_5_1985-02_Carnegie_Publications_US/page/n13/mode/2up}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' rated the ColecoVision version 48% in 1989.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Complete Games Guide |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 October 1989 |issue=Complete Guide to Consoles |pages=46–77 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/98/CompleteGuideToConsoles_UK_01.pdf#page=46}}</ref>
