== Development and release ==
{{Expand section|date=November 2020}}
The game was created by Russel Dawe. The game was under development using the title ''Agent X'' when the movie producers and Atari learned of each other's projects and decided to cooperate. When Atari was consulted to provide a game as an element of the movie, they tweaked ''Agent X'' and renamed it ''Cloak & Dagger''. [[Dabney Coleman]]'s character was named "Jack Flack" in the movie in lieu of "Agent X". The film shows an [[Atari 5200]] version of the game, but the cartridge props are actually other 5200 games with a ''Cloak & Dagger'' label stuck on them and the gameplay footage is of the arcade version modified to output onto a television screen. A 5200 port was planned, but development on it never began.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Alex|url=http://www.atarihq.com/5200/5200faq/02_06.html|title=Atari 5200 FAQ: 2.6 - WHAT'S THE REAL STORY BEHIND CLOAK AND DAGGER?|website=atarihq.com|date=September 12, 1994|access-date=2020-11-28|archive-date=2019-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190718000258/http://www.atarihq.com/5200/5200faq/02_06.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

A port for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was being developed by Atari, Inc. employee Dave Comstock in 1984, but was never finished.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reichert|first=Matt|url=http://www.atariprotos.com/8bit/software/cloakdagger/cloakdagger.htm|title=Atari 8-bit Software - Cloak & Dagger|website=www.atariprotos.com|access-date=2020-11-28|archive-date=2020-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006055830/http://www.atariprotos.com/8bit/software/cloakdagger/cloakdagger.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>
