{{nihongo foot|'''''Duck Hunt'''''|ダックハント|Dakku Hanto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1984 [[light gun shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) [[video game console]] and the [[Nintendo VS. System]] arcade hardware. The game was first released in April 1984, in Japan for the [[Family Computer]] (Famicom) console and in North America as an [[arcade game]]. It became a [[launch game]] for the NES in North America in October 1985, and was re-released in Europe two years later.

Players fire the [[NES Zapper]] at a [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] television,<ref name="howtogeek.com">{{cite web |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Jason |title=How the Nintendo NES Zapper Worked, and Why It Doesn't Work On HDTVs |url=https://www.howtogeek.com/181303/htg-explains-how-the-nintendo-zapper-worked-and-why-it-doesnt-work-on-new-tvs/ |website=www.howtogeek.com |date=October 6, 2018 |access-date=January 3, 2019}}</ref> with three attempts per [[level (video gaming)|round]] to shoot ducks and [[Clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeons]].

The game initially received a positive reception in the mid-1980s,<ref name="Adlum"/> but was later given mild praise in retrospective reviews.<ref name="Allgame review"/><ref name="Gamespot people"/> The game was inspired by Nintendo's previous ''Duck Hunt'' [[Electro-mechanical game|electro-mechanical arcade game]] which was based on the [[Laser Clay Shooting System]] released in 1976.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.japan-games.com/Database/images/Nintendo/TV-Game/Duckhunt/index.htm |title = Nintendo Duck Hunt (1976) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302073933/http://www.japan-games.com/Database/images/Nintendo/TV-Game/Duckhunt/index.htm |archive-date=March 2, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Upon release as a video game, ''Duck Hunt'' became a major commercial success both for arcades and consoles in the 1980s, helping to popularize [[light gun]] video games with over 28 million copies sold worldwide.

In 1986, the nationwide launch of the NES included the Deluxe Set bundle with [[pack-in game]]s ''Duck Hunt'' and ''[[Gyromite]]''. The later Action Set has ''Duck Hunt'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' on one cartridge. The final ''Duck Hunt'' bundle is the Power Set, with a multi-cart with ''[[Stadium Events|World Class Track Meet]]'', ''Super Mario Bros.'', and ''Duck Hunt''. The game was released on [[Virtual Console]] for the [[Wii U]] in 2014.

''Duck Hunt'' is a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[shooter game]] with moving on-screen targets, firing the [[NES Zapper]] [[light gun]] at a [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] television screen.<ref name="howtogeek.com"/> The player selects the game mode, one or two targets appear, and the player has three attempts to hit them before they disappear.

The player must hit a minimum number of targets to advance to the next round or else get a [[game over]]. The difficulty progresses with faster targets of an increasing minimum number. The player receives points per target and bonus points for shooting all ten targets per round. The highest scores are tracked per session.

''Duck Hunt'' has three optional game modes. In Game A and Game B, the targets are flying ducks, and in Game C the targets are [[Clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeon]]s that are launched into the distance. In Game A, one duck appears at a time and in Game B two ducks appear.<ref name="Duck Hunt rules"/> Game A allows a second player to control the flying ducks with a [[Nintendo Entertainment System#Controllers|NES controller]].<ref name="cheats">{{cite web |url=http://cheats.ign.com/ob2/068/007/007158.html |title=Duck Hunt Cheats |access-date=November 21, 2006|website=IGN}}</ref> Completing Round 99 in Game A advances to Round 0, which is a [[kill screen]] where the game behaves erratically, such as haphazard or nonexistent targets, thus ending progress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://satoshimatrix.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/top-100-nesfamicom-games-list-100-90/ |title=Top 100 NES/Famicom Games List #100-90 |work=Retro and Contemporary Gaming Archives |date=August 17, 2011}}</ref>

Gameplay consists of alternating rounds of Games B and C, with 12 targets per round instead of 10 and sometimes three targets at once instead of two. Every missed target costs one life until the game ends.

After every second round, a [[bonus stage]] has ducks flying out of the grass with the [[hunting dog]] occasionally jumping into the line of fire as a distraction. If shot, the dog scolds the player and the bonus stage ends. According to [[Nintendo of America]] employee Jerry Momoda, the dog was made impossible to shoot on console releases to make the game more family friendly.<ref name=BeforeYouDie/>{{rp|45–46}}

In ''[[Wii Play]]'' (2006) and its sequel ''[[Wii Play: Motion]]'' (2011), some elements from ''Duck Hunt'' and ''[[Hogan's Alley (video game)|Hogan's Alley]]'' are in the mini-games "Shooting Range" and "Trigger Twist", in which some of the various targets are ducks and cans.

The dog and a duck, collectively referred to as "Duck Hunt", appear as playable characters in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]''. [[Masahiro Sakurai]], the creator and director of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, said that ''Duck Hunt''{{'}}s commercial success as "the most-sold shooting game in the world" was one of the primary reasons for its inclusion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamnesia.com/news/sakurai-explains-duck-hunts-inclusion-in-smash |title=Sakurai Explains Duck Hunt's Inclusion in Smash |date=January 2, 2015 |access-date=February 2, 2015 |work=Gamnesia |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |last=Rollins |first=Steven |archive-date=February 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203094533/http://www.gamnesia.com/news/sakurai-explains-duck-hunts-inclusion-in-smash |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the games, the ''Duck Hunt'' team utilizes multiple attacks inspired by the light gun, including throwing clay pigeons, kicking an explosive version of the can from ''Hogan's Alley'', summoning the cast of ''[[Wild Gunman]]'' to fire at opponents with their guns, or comically dodging shots fired at opponents from the Zapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/11/new-super-smash-bros-characters-confirmed-in-stream|title=New Super Smash Bros.
