'''''Full Throttle''''' is a video game released in [[1984 in video gaming|1984]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and written by Mervyn Estcourt, creator of ''[[Deathchase]]''. The player races a 500cc Grand Prix motorcycle on any of ten of the world's top racing circuits. It was later ported to other platforms and released under the name '''''Speed King'''''.

== Gameplay ==
After selecting a track to race on, the player starts at the back of the grid, with 39 other bikes. Cornering too quickly will cause a skid, while running off the road slow the bike down, and making contact with another rider forces the bike to a halt, allowing the following riders to stream past the player as the bike gets going again. There are ten circuits in the game, and part of the key to winning is to know the circuit well enough to predict the bends. There is a practice mode, in which the player rides round the track without any other riders, or the player can choose a race of between one and five laps. The best position achieved is shown at the bottom of the menu-screen, along with the player's time ahead of the second-place man. As soon as the track or number of laps is changed, this record is reset.<ref name="Inlay">{{Citation|title=Full Throttle Inlay|publisher=[[Micromega]]}}</ref><ref name="CRASH_Review">{{Citation|title=Full Throttle Review|newspaper=[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]|date=August 1984}}</ref><ref name="CVG_Review">{{Citation|title=Full Throttle Review|newspaper=[[Computer and Video Games]]|date=September 1984}}</ref><ref name="SU_Review">{{Citation|title=Full Throttle Review|newspaper=[[Sinclair User]]|first=Chris|last=Bourne|date=October 1984}}</ref><ref name="YS_Review">{{Citation|title=Full Throttle Review|newspaper=[[Your Spectrum]]|first=Ron|last=Smith|first2=David|last2=Lester|date=November 1984}}</ref>

== Release ==
Following the release of ''Full Throttle'' on the ZX Spectrum, Micromega declined Estcourt's Commodore 64 conversion due to their inexperience in the Commodore market and the rising costs in the industry. Instead, Digital Integration published the Commodore port in 1985 under the name ''Speed King''.<ref name='retrogamermicromega'>{{cite magazine |title=From The Archives: Micromega|magazine=Retro Gamer|issue=81|publisher=Future Publishing|date=16 September 2010|page=76-80}}</ref>

In 1986 the game was re-released at budget price. ''Full Throttle'' was published for the Spectrum by [[Elite Systems]] on their Â£2.99 Classics label,<ref name='pcw299'>{{cite magazine |title=Storm breaks over Elite's budget label|magazine=Popular Computing Weekly|issue=49|publisher=Sunshine Publications|date=4 December 1986|page=6|url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/page.php?issue_id=2937&page=6|access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref> while [[Mastertronic]] published ''Speed King'' for the Commodore 64 and ported the game to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 16 and MSX.
