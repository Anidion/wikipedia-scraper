'''''To Preserve Quandic''''' is a graphical [[adventure game]] written by David Karam for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] and published by Prickly Pear Software in 1984. Taking two full disks, it was larger than both ''[[The Sands of Egypt]]'' and ''[[The Dallas Quest]]'', which preceded it.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The premise is to preserve the pacifistic Quandic race, who had advanced technology like time machines.
