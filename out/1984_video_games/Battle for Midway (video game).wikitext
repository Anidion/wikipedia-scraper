'''''Battle for Midway''''' (also called '''''The Battle of Midway''''') is a [[turn-based strategy]] video game developed and published by [[Personal Software Services]]. It was first released in the United Kingdom and France for the [[MSX]] in 1984, and was re-released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1985. It is the second instalment of the ''Wargamers'' series. The game is set during the [[Battle of Midway]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|Pacific Ocean theatre]] of [[World War II]] and revolves around the [[United States Navy]] attacking a large [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] fleet stationed at [[Midway Atoll]], in retaliation for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].

In the game, the player assumes control of American forces and must eliminate all Japanese forces around the atoll by air or naval combat. ''Battle for Midway'' received largely negative reviews upon release. It was criticised for its incompatibility with [[black and white television]] sets, as the game was only accessible in a limited range of colours. The easy difficulty of the gameplay was also criticised.

The game received negative reviews upon release. Angus Ryall of ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' criticised the game's incompatibility with [[black and white television]] sets, stating that, despite a growing British economy, Ryall expected the developers to have designed games for "the lowest common denominator".<ref name=crash>{{cite journal|last1=Ryall|first1=Angus|title=The Battle for Midway review (Crash)|journal=Crash|date=July 1985|issue=18|page=126|url=http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/review.aspx?gid=548&rid=5649|access-date=16 January 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130092822/http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/review.aspx?gid=548&rid=5649|archive-date=30 January 2016}}</ref> Gwyn Hughes of ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' criticised the tactical elements of the game as too light, stating that the success of the player depends on dexterity, and not "brainpower".<ref name=YS>{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Gwyn|title=Conflicts 2: Battle for Midway|journal=Your Sinclair|date=August 1987|issue=20|page=74|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/YourSinclair/Issue20/Pages/YourSinclair2000074.jpg|access-date=16 January 2016}}</ref> Clare Edgely of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' praised the game's historical accuracy, however she felt that its late release in comparison to other wargames made ''Battle for Midway'' feel "ordinary".<ref name=SU>{{cite journal|last1=Edgely |first1=Clare |title=Battle of Midway review |url=http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/040/sftwreb.htm |journal=Sinclair User |date=September 1985 |issue=40 |access-date=16 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207142110/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/040/sftwreb.htm |archive-date=February 7, 2012 }}</ref> A reviewer of ''[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]'' stated that the game was a "flawed" attempt to recreate the famous Battle of Midway, despite admitting that it contained "some nice touches".<ref name=YC>{{cite journal|title=Battle for Midway review|journal=Your Computer|date=November 1984|volume=4|issue=11|page=51|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-computer-magazine-1984-11/YourComputer_1984_11#page/n50/mode/1up|access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref> A reviewer of ''Australian Commodore Review'' praised the game's wide range of features such as the save and load functions.

Two reviewers of ''[[Your Spectrum]]'' criticised the combat sequences' reliance on the speed of pressing keys instead of the use of strategy. One reviewer considered the game to be sophisticated, however the other reviewer viewed the game's slow pace and graphics negatively.<ref name=your>{{cite journal|title=Joystick Fury: Battle of Midway|journal=Your Spectrum|date=August 1985|issue=17|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr17/yr17_39.htm|access-date=16 January 2016}}</ref> Despite the criticism, Ryall praised the real time element of the game and accessibility, saying that ''Battle for Midway'' is up to "current standards".<ref name=crash/> A reviewer of ''[[Amstrad Action]]'' praised the game's "accurate" reproduction of events and different levels of speed, however criticised the easy predictability of Japanese forces.<ref name=action>{{cite journal|title=Battle for Midway review|journal=Amstrad Action|date=October 1985|issue=1|page=87|url=https://archive.org/stream/amstrad-action-001/Amstrad_Action_001#page/n87/mode/2up/search/midway|access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref> A reviewer of ''[[Amtix]]'' stated that the game suffered from "average" graphics and "poor" sound, and also questioned the inclusion of the arcade sequences.<ref name=amtix>{{cite journal|title=Battle for Midway review (Amtix)|journal=Amtix|date=December 1985|issue=2|page=74|url=https://archive.org/stream/amtix-magazine-02/Amtix_02_Dec_1985#page/n73/mode/2up/search/midway|access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref> A reviewer of ''[[Your 64]]'' recommended ''Battle for Midway'' for beginners to the genre, despite stating that it was "not a simple game".<ref name=y64>{{cite journal|title=Battle of Midway review (Y64)|journal=Your 64|date=February 1985|issue=6|pages=51|url=https://archive.org/stream/your64-magazine-06/Your64_Issue_06_1985_Feb#page/n50/mode/1up|access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref> A reviewer of ''Commodore Horizons'' called it an "enthralling" game.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Soft Hits: Battle for Midway|journal=Commodore Horizons|date=October 1984|issue=10|page=24|url=https://archive.org/stream/commodore-horizons-10/Commodore_Horizons_Issue_10_1984_Oct#page/n17/mode/1up|access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref>
