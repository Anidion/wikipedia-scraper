==Plot==
The player starts on a beach with no memory of his identity. The island is a self-contained area with beaches, rocky cliffs, a hut and a [[quicksand]] area, which serves as a maze for the player to reach another location of the game. The character's main objective is to gather objects necessary to assemble a bonfire as a signal for any passing ships.

Once this is accomplished, the character finds himself on board a pirate ship pursued by the [[Royal Navy]] without a means to leave the ship or reach any destination. The player has to find a means to stop the ship and thus be rescued and dropped somewhere in London. Clues about the character's past are introduced at this point, as the character receives mysterious instructions and even evades attempts against his life. After buying a forged ticket, the character flies to [[Luxembourg]] where he receives more clues and finally confront his nemesis.

If the player has uncovered enough clues (i.e. by reading a newspaper, or finding notes and messages on dead bodies) at the very end, the character will be able to regain his memory. It is revealed that he is wealthy industrialist William Arcman, whose [[evil twin]] brother, Jared, having faked his own death, attempted to make William disappear and then [[identity theft|steal his identity]] to take advantage of his wealth. The story started right after Jared hit William on the head and dropped him on a desert island.

==Gameplay==

The detective mystery is portrayed in an interactive fiction adventure game style. A window displays static graphics with the environment the character sees.<ref name="allgame">{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=29381&tab=review|title=Mindshadow|author=Rovi Corporation|publisher=|access-date=2014-12-03|archive-date=2014-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114140105/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=29381&tab=review|url-status=dead}}</ref>

An important command of the game is <code>REMEMBER</code> which is used with clues. (e.g. <code>REMEMBER WILLIAM ARCMAN</code>) which is obligatory for the player to regain his memory at the end.

The game accepts also the phrase <code>HELP CONDOR</code>; a [[condor]] appears giving the player cryptic hints (when available). This can be employed only three times in each playthrough.<ref>Game documentation</ref>
