'''''Baltic 1985: Corridor To Berlin''''' is a [[computer wargame]] published in 1984 by [[Strategic Simulations]]. Developed by [[Roger Keating]], it is the third in the "When Superpowers Collide" series.

==Gameplay==
In 1985, after [[NATO]] halts a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion of [[West Germany]], and a communist invasion of [[Saudi Arabia]] is thwarted by the American [[Rapid deployment force|Rapid Deployment Forces]], the Soviets rush forces from the West German front into [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] to put down an anti-Soviet uprising.  NATO takes advantage of the moment by invading East Germany to relieve the siege of [[West Berlin]] and evacuate its personnel trapped behind enemy lines.

The player may choose to play either the NATO or Soviet forces, and can play in turns against another human component or against the computer.
