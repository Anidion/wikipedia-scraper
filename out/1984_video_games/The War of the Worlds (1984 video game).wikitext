'''''The War of the Worlds''''', titled on screen as '''''Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds''''' and on the cover as '''''Jeff Wayne's Video Game Version of The War of the Worlds''''' is a [[ZX Spectrum]] [[video game]] developed and released by [[CRL Group]] in [[1984 in video gaming|1984]]. The game is based upon the [[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds|1978 concept album]], itself based on [[H.G. Wells]]' 1898 novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.

Gameplay required the player to visit a series of sites in and around [[London]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/sinclair-user-magazine-032/page/n29/mode/1up?view=theater|title = Sinclair User Magazine Issue 032|date = November 1984}}</ref> by moving a person using cursor keys or a joystick, and occasionally making choices such as whether to hide, run or stand still.

The game was unpopular with reviewers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/war-of-the-worlds/|title = War of the Worlds (C64) - 1984 CRL - GTW64}}</ref> because it ran very slowly and the player was often killed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/sinclair-user-magazine-032/page/n29/mode/1up?view=theater|title = Sinclair User Magazine Issue 032|date = November 1984}}</ref> (hunger and thirst being common causes of death) and forced to begin the adventure from scratch. Despite this, the game peaked at number 8 in the weekly computer game charts<ref name='pcn'>{{cite magazine |title=PCN Charts|magazine=Personal Computer News|issue=|publisher=VNU|date=28 July 1984|page=8|url=https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerNews/PersonalComputerNews071-28Jul1984/page/n7/mode/2up|access-date=17 December 2021}}</ref> making it one of CRL's highest charting titles.

Original 2-page magazine advertisements stated 'available for ZX Spectrum' but also had a list of other formats the game was 'to be created for' including the [[Commodore 64]], [[Oric Atmos]], [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]][http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue034/Pages/CVG03400004.jpg] but no other versions were completed.
