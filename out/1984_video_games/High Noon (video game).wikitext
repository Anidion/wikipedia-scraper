'''''High Noon''''' ('''''Highnoon''''' on the title screen) is a western-themed [[shoot 'em up]] game written for the [[Commodore 64]] and published by [[Ocean Software]] in 1984. Originally advertised on both the Commodore 64 and [[ZX Spectrum]], the game itself was only ever released on the Commodore 64.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0014871|title = World of Spectrum - High Noon}}</ref>

The game has five [[Level (computer and video games)|levels]]. The player takes the role of the good (white) [[sheriff]] in the [[American Old West]]. He must defend his town against [[outlaw]]s looking to abduct women from the local ''"Saucy Sue's [[Western saloon|Saloon]]"'' and [[Bank robbery|rob the local bank]], by shooting them. Shooting can be done in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction.

The background music is “Do Not Forsake Me: The Ballad of High Noon,” from the movie ''[[High Noon]]'', and arranged for the game by David Dunn.<ref>https://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/cinema-and-music/ballad_of_high_noon/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDo%20Not%20Forsake%20Me%E2%80%9D%2C,more%20than%20a%20catchy%20tune.</ref><ref>https://lacoste42.itch.io/high-noon</ref>

The game consists of five levels. In each level, the difficulty is increased:
* Level 2 introduces outlaws on horseback
* Level 3 introduces outlaws planting sticks of [[dynamite]]
* Level 4 features outlaws hiding behind windows

After each level there is a bonus [[duel]], featuring the sheriff and an outlaw, requiring a fast reaction time from the player. In level 1 through 4, an [[undertaker]] from ''"[[Rigor mortis|Rig+ Mortis]] Undertakers"'' collects any bodies lying around during the game.

Level 5 takes place in a different setting. The stage is set in a field surrounding a central cave opening, from which outlaws may appear. After surviving level 5, the game returns to level 1.
