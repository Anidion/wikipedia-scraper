'''''Technician Ted''''' (also known as '''''The Chip Factory: Featuring Technician Ted''''') is a [[platform game]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] home computers that was written by Steve Marsden and David Cooke and published in 1984 by [[Hewson Consultants]].

==Plot==
Technician Ted is an enthusiastic young computer hacker who works at the chip factory. He begins his work every day at 8.30am and must complete 21 tasks before clocking off at 5.00pm, but his boss has not told him what the tasks are or where they are located. Ted speaks to his mate, who tells him that his first job is to get to his desk, and from there he must make his way to the "Silicon Slice Store".<ref name = "instruct">{{cite web | url = ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/t/TechnicianTed.txt | title = ''Technician Ted'' instructions | accessdate = 2007-01-30}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
''Technician Ted'' is a [[flick-screen]] platform game made up of many different named screens. On many of these screens there are two boxes which must be touched in the correct order (the first one will be flashing) in order to complete the task.<ref name = "instruct" /> Some of these tasks must be completed within a time-limit making it important for the player to guide Ted from one box to the other as quickly as possible.<ref name = "instruct" />

As well as the tasks, Ted must avoid the various monsters that lurk in the factory and make sure he completes all of his tasks within the game's time limit so he can finish his day.

The in-game music is an adaptation of the [[Radetzky March]] by [[Johann Strauss Sr.]]

The Spectrum and Amstrad{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} versions feature a sprite-animated loading screen with a countdown timer,<ref name = "crashrev"/> a significant technical achievement at the time.<!--given ref doesn't support this last bit, but I don't think anyone would dispute this?-->
