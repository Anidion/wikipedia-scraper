''Field of Fire'' focuses on recreating the wartime fate of Easy Company, one of the companies of the [[1st_Infantry_Division_(United_States)#World_War_II|1st Infantry Division]] during [[World War II]]. The player is tasked with leading Easy Company through eight historical battles in North Africa and Europe. As a company commander, the player gives orders to six-man teams armed with rifles, machine guns, [[Mortar_(weapon)|mortars]] or [[Bazooka|bazookas]]. Each team's abilities, such as weapon range and firepower, are based on real-world factors, and managing individual teams is a big part of a successful battle.

Separate game phases allow the player to observe the battlefield, fire, move or storm nearby positions. The German forces are controlled by an AI that offers three levels of difficulty.
