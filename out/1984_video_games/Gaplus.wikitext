{{nihongo foot|'''''Gaplus'''''|ギャプラス|Gyapurasu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1984 [[fixed shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed and released by [[Namco]]. It is the third game in the ''[[List of Galaxian video games|Galaxian]]'' series, serving as a direct sequel to ''[[Galaga]]'' (1981). In North America, a modification kit was later released to change the name to '''''Galaga 3''''', possibly to reflect its position in the series.<ref name="RGamer">{{cite news |title=The Definitive Galaxian |url=https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_032#page/n73/mode/2up |access-date=September 22, 2019 |agency=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=32 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |date=December 2006 |pages=68–75}}</ref> It was the only game other than ''[[Phozon]]'' to run on the [[Namco Phozon]] hardware. A contemporary home port for the [[Commodore 64]] was released in 1988. A "demastered" version of the game (in the style of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]) was included in ''[[Namco Museum|Namco Museum Archives Vol. 2]]'' as a bonus title.

The objective of ''Gaplus'' is to score as many points as possible by defeating successive waves of enemies in levels called "Parsecs". Its core gameplay is very similar to ''Galaga'': Enemies fly onto the screen in rows and join a formation near the top, then begin attacking the player's ship with [[kamikaze]]-like dives. The ship can move left and right, as well as vertically. Bonus lives are earned at certain score intervals, and can also be gained by collecting ship parts dropped by some enemies, as well as collecting ''[[Rally-X]]'' bonus flags from shooting stars. The player loses a life when struck by an enemy or one of their shots; the game ends when all lives are lost.

Certain enemies drop upgrades that include a [[tractor beam]] which the player can use to capture enemies, a large drill that can destroy many enemies at once, powerups that temporarily slow down enemies or nullify their shots, and parts to create a new ship that awards an extra life when completed. Some stages begin with the star field reversing direction, with harder and faster waves of enemies appearing before resuming a normal formation.

The game features bonus "Challenging Stages" just as ''Galaga'' did. However, instead of defeating a certain number of enemies, the objective of the challenging stage in ''Gaplus'' is to juggle enemies by hitting them as many times as possible. Each hit grants a dot (represented by a bee) in a word or phrase, with extra hits adding to horizontal lines above and below the word. Spelling the entire word or phrase will earn a bonus related to that phrase, and each hit scores bonus points at the end of the round.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Gaplus'' on their [[1984 in video games|May 15, 1984]] issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]] |issue=236 |publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press]] |date=May 15, 1984 |page=29 |lang=ja |url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19840515p.pdf#page=15}}</ref>
