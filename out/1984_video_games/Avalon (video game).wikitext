'''''Avalon''''' (with the tagline '''''The 3D Adventure Movie''''' on the box cover) is an [[action-adventure game]] written by Steve Turner for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and published by [[Hewson Consultants]] in 1984.<ref name="giantlist"/> ''Avalon'' was followed by a sequel in 1985, ''[[Dragontorc]]''.<ref name="giantlist" />
==Plot==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}

Avalon is set in Britain in the year 408, during the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The player controls Maroc, a "lore-seeker" who has been given a staff and map by a strange old woman and pointed in the direction of a place called Glass Hill on the isle of Avalon, where a quest to defeat the Lord of Chaos begins.

The name "Avalon" is taken from [[King Arthur]]'s legendary resting place, the isle of [[Avalon]], while a figure named [[Afallach|Avallach]] features in [[Welsh mythology]]. Other than this and the time period the game is set in, there is little connection to the [[Arthurian legend]].

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}

''Avalon'' involves controlling Maroc the mage in his quest to destroy Avelach, Lord of Chaos. The player's character cannot be killed. The game world is explored by an [[astral projection]] of Maroc; if Maroc's energy is depleted the projection returns to Maroc's "physical" body, from which the game can be continued.<ref name=":0" />
