'''''Mr. Dig''''' is a [[maze video game]] programmed by Rita Jay and published in 1984 by [[Microdeal]] for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]],<ref name="giantlist"/> [[Commodore 64]], [[Dragon 32/64]], and [[TRS-80 Color Computer]]. The game is a direct clone of [[Universal Entertainment|Universal]]'s 1982 arcade game, ''[[Mr. Do!]]''.

==Gameplay==

The object of the game is to guide the titular "Mr. Dig" through a maze by digging tunnels, collecting cherries, and avoiding the various monsters that come out to get him. Mr. Dig can defeat them by hitting them with his bouncing "power ball" or by dropping large apples on them.

There are several types of monsters that try to prevent Mr. Dig from getting the cherries. The least threatening are simply Meanies - small characters that can only chase Mr. Dig. Although their touch is deadly, they can't tunnel behind the players, so they can be led to a dead end and trapped with one of the apples. Meanies can transform into Miners, and these creatures pose a greater threat to Mr. Dig because they can tunnel behind him and eat the apples.

The game allows the player to choose one of ten difficulty levels from "Big Baby's Level" (easy) to "Masochist's Level" (impossible).

===Audio===
The game uses excerpts from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)#III. Alla turca|Turkish March]] as its main musical theme.

==Reception==
The game has been met with fairly positive reviews. ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reviewer summed up ''Mr. Dig'' as "a really nice game from Microdeal, very playable and extremely addictive".<ref name="cvg"/> The ''[[Page 6]]'' reviewer liked the game better than ''Mr. Do'', feeling that it was harder than the latter and thought that ''Mr. Dig'' will appeal to a wider range of computer gamers.<ref name="page6"/>
