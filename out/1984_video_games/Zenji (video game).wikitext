Zenji is a maze-based game, wherein the player controls a "disembodied, Mandarin-style head". The challenge is to connect a series of randomly rotated maze-segments in an attempt to align them with a glowing artifact, known as "the source", which acts as each maze's focal point. The player moves to each segment of the maze and attempts to rotate that portion so that the source's green light can shine into that region, signifying a correct alignment. If all  portions of the maze are connected successfully before the end of a timer, the player is awarded points, and moves on to the next stage. Successive mazes introduce greater complexity and hazards to the player's survival.<ref name="computegazette"/>

==Reception==
In the conclusion of the review for the ''[[Commodore 64]]'' edition of ''Zenji'', the author in [[Compute!]] Gazette stated, "Although final understanding of the source remains elusive, Zenji is an undeniably enjoyable game". Of note, the last paragraph of the review also stated that, "Zenji appears to be a multiplayer game...up to 8 acolytes at a time...There's no documentation concerning this, however."<ref name="computegazette"/>

Gregg Williams reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "If you like geometric puzzles and games like Othello, you should like Zenji. It is a potential classic and gives exceptional value for the money."<ref name="CGW22">{{cite magazine |last=Williams |first=Gregg |title=Micro-Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=June–July 1985 |volume=1 |issue=22 |pages=36}}</ref>
