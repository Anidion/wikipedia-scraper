==Gameplay==
[[Image:GrandPrixManagerscreen.gif|thumb|left|Screenshot showing sponsorship negotiations.]]
''Grand Prix Manager'' places the player in the role of the manager of a [[Formula 1]] racing team, with the ultimate goal being to reach to highest management rating. This can only be achieved by winning the championship on the hardest difficulty setting.<ref name="bigK"/>

The player can choose how many races to take part in over the course of a season,<ref name="bigK" /> and after each race the player is presented with a race performance screen, followed by car upgrade options. Revenue is generated through [[sponsorship]], however sponsors will base their investment on their satisfaction with previous race results. This income is used to hire mechanics and a driver from a set list of well-known Formula 1 drivers.<ref name="sincuser" />

The player makes choices from menu screens regarding aspects of the car such as the tires, depth of tire tread and angle of the rear [[Formula 1 car#Wings|wing]], and is then shown highlights of the race.<ref name="sincuser" />

==Reception==
Chris Bourne of ''[[Sinclair User]]'' found the game to be unimpressive, especially as it was from the same publisher as ''[[Football Manager (1982 series)|Football Manager]]''. He found the in-race graphics to be motionless. He scored the game 1/10.<ref name="sincuser">{{Cite journal|date=March 1985|author=Bourne, Chris|title=Grand Prix Manager|journal=[[Sinclair User]]|issue=36|pages=40}}</ref> Sean Cox of ''[[Big K (magazine)|Big K]]'' was more positive towards the game, giving it a "KK" rating (maximum is "KKK"), and saying that people who enjoyed ''Football Manager'' would enjoy this game as well.<ref name="bigK">{{Cite journal|date=February 1985|author=Cox, Sean|title=Grand Prix Manager|journal=[[Big K (magazine)|Big K]]|issue=11|pages=16}}</ref>
