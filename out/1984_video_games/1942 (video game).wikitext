'''''1942''''' is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] by [[Capcom]] that was released as an [[arcade video game]] in 1984. Designed by [[Yoshiki Okamoto]], it was the first game in the [[List of World War II video games#The 194X series|''194X'' series]], and was followed by ''[[1943: The Battle of Midway]]''.

''1942'' is set in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], and is loosely based on the [[Battle of Midway]]. Despite the game being created by Japanese developers, the goal is to reach [[Tokyo]] and destroy the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] air fleet; this was due to being the first Capcom game designed with Western markets in mind. It went on to be a commercial success in arcades, becoming Japan's fifth highest-grossing table arcade game of 1986 and one of top five highest-grossing arcade conversion kits that year in the United States. It was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], selling over 1 million copies worldwide, along with other home systems.

== Gameplay ==

{{Expand section|date=November 2020}}

The player pilots a [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] dubbed the "Super Ace". The player has to shoot down enemy planes and avoid enemy fire: a single hit on the plane or a collision with another aircraft causes the loss of one life. During the game, the player may collect a series of [[power-ups]], one of them allowing the plane to be escorted by two other smaller fighters in a [[FICON project#Project MX-1016 (Tip Tow)|Tip Tow]] formation. Enemies included: [[Kawasaki Ki-61]]s, [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s and [[Kawasaki Ki-48]]s. The boss plane is a [[Nakajima G10N]].

The game has "a special roll button that allows players to avoid dangerous situations by temporarily looping out of" the playfield.<ref name="Allgame_ARC"/> In addition to the standard [[high score]], it also has a separate percentage high score, recording the best ratio of enemy fighters to enemies shot down.<ref name="CG"/>

== Development ==
The game was designed by [[Yoshiki Okamoto]]. The game's main goal was to be easily accessible for players. This is why they decided to use a [[World War II]] theme. ''1942'' was also the first Capcom game designed with Western markets in mind. That was why they decided to have the player pilot an American P-38 fighter plane, to appeal to the American market.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Developer Interviews – Capcom and the CPS-1 |magazine=[[Gamest]] |date=September 30, 1989 |volume=4 |issue=11 (November 1989) |page=10 |url=http://shmuplations.com/cps1/}}</ref> The game is loosely based on the [[Battle of Midway]], which was a turning point in the [[Pacific War]] when the Americans began defeating the Japanese.<ref name="CG"/>

==Ports==
The game was released to the [[MSX]], [[NEC PC-8801]], [[FM-7]], and [[X1 (computer)|Sharp X1]]. It was released to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in 1985 in Japan and North America in 1986. The Famicom version was developed by [[Micronics]].

A [[Game Boy Color]] version was also released in North America in May 2000 and the PAL region in the year 2001.

The European games publisher [[Elite Systems]] later released versions for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[Commodore 64]].

The music of the Commodore 64 version is based on the main verse of Ron Goodwin's ''[[633 Squadron]]'' film score,<ref>{{cite web|title=(Review for 1942: Arranged/Remixed tunes by Sabal Do'Ghym)|url=http://www.mirsoft.info/gmb/review_show.php?id=2999|website=MIRSOFT|access-date=4 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030002712/http://www.mirsoft.info/gmb/review_show.php?id=2999|archive-date=30 October 2016}}</ref> with arrangement by Mark Cooksey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirsoft.info/gmb/music_info.php?id_ele=NTA= |title=Game music base - database of Games, Games music and soundtracks|website=mirsoft.info |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305024714/http://www.mirsoft.info/gmb/music_info.php?id_ele=NTA%3D |archive-date=March 5, 2016}}</ref>

Mike Roberts reviewed the arcade game in the May 1985 issue of British magazine ''[[Computer Gamer]]''. While noting the game's scenario was "an odd subject for a Japanese arcade manufacturer" to take up, he said it has "nice" graphics and had an "original" gameplay feature in the form of the percentage high score.<ref name="CG"/> Retrospectively, Brett Alan Weiss of ''[[AllGame]]'' called it "a fondly remembered" shooter and praising the special roll button, "perfectly balanced" gameplay, "colorfully detailed" graphics, and "nifty" power-ups.<ref name="Allgame_ARC"/>

==Legacy==
''1942'' was the first Capcom title to spawn a successful series of sequels, with five titles in the [[List of World War II video games#The 194X series|''194X'']] line released from 1987 to 2000. Many of Capcom's other vertical shooters featured very similar gameplay, such as ''[[Varth: Operation Thunderstorm]]''.

It was re-released in ''[[Capcom Generations#Capcom Generations 1: Wings of Destiny|Capcom Generations 1]]'' for the PlayStation and Saturn consoles. It was featured in the ''[[Capcom Classics Collection]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], as well as ''[[Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. The arcade version was added to the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on December 21, 2010, and in the PAL and North American regions in January 2011. It was also re-released for [[Windows Mobile Professional]].

''[[1942: Joint Strike]]'' was released for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in 2008. ''1942: First Strike'' was released for [[iOS]] in 2010.

The game series has sold a total of 1.4 million units worldwide as of December 2019, and stands as Capcom's 18th best-selling franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/finance/salesdata.html|title=CAPCOM Game Series Sales|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>
