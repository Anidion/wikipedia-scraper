'''''Elite''''' is a [[space trading and combat simulator|space trading]] [[video game]]. It was written and developed by [[David Braben]] and [[Ian Bell (programmer)|Ian Bell]] and originally published by [[Acornsoft]] for the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] computers in September 1984.<ref name=elite_home/> ''Elite''{{'}}s [[Open-ended (gameplay)|open-ended game model]], and revolutionary 3D graphics led to it being ported to virtually every contemporary [[home computer]] system and earned it a place as a classic and a genre maker in gaming history.<ref name=escapist>{{cite magazine |last=LaMosca |first=Adam |title=Lost in the Void |magazine=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |date=18 July 2006 |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_54/324-Lost-in-the-Void |access-date=17 November 2007 |archive-date=25 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225101232/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_54/324-Lost-in-the-Void |url-status=dead }}</ref> The game's title derives from one of the player's goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of "Elite".

''Elite'' was one of the first [[home computer]] games to use [[Wire-frame model|wire-frame 3D graphics]] with [[hidden-line removal]].<ref name=gazzard201312/> It added graphics and [[twitch gameplay]] aspects to the genre established by the 1974 game ''[[Star Trader]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aBPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA | title=Practical Computing | journal=Practical Computing | year=1985 | volume=8 | page=100}}</ref> Another novelty was the inclusion of ''[[The Dark Wheel (novella)|The Dark Wheel]]'', a novella by [[Robert Holdstock]] which gave players insight into the moral and legal codes to which they might aspire.

The ''Elite'' series is among the [[List of longest-running video game franchises|longest-running video game franchises]]. The first game was followed by the sequels ''[[Frontier: Elite II]]'' in 1993,<ref name=frontierPage>{{cite web | url=http://www.frontier.co.uk/games/older/frontier_elite_ii/ | title=Frontier: Elite II official page | year=2007 | access-date=2 July 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923083448/http://frontier.co.uk/games/older/frontier_elite_ii/ | archive-date=23 September 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and ''[[Frontier: First Encounters]]'' in 1995,<ref name="ffe-official">{{cite web|url=http://frontier.co.uk/games/older/frontier_first_encounters/|title=Frontier: First Encounters - Official site|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123044505/http://frontier.co.uk/games/older/frontier_first_encounters/|archive-date=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> which introduced [[Newtonian Physics|Newtonian physics]], realistic star systems and seamless freeform planetary landings.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:BBC Micro Elite screenshot.png|thumb|left|The BBC Micro version of ''Elite'', showing the player approaching a Coriolis space station]]

The player initially controls the character "Commander Jameson",<ref name="postmortem"/> though the name can be changed each time the game is saved. The player starts at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship, a Cobra Mark III.<ref name=elite_home/> Most of the ships that the player encounters are similarly named after [[snake]]s or other [[reptile]]s.<ref name="zzap64"/> Credits can be accumulated through a number of means. These include piracy, trade,<ref name=elite_home/> military missions, bounty hunting and  [[asteroid mining]]. The money generated by these enterprises allows the player to upgrade their ship with enhancements such as better weapons, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, an extra energy bank and more.<ref name="mobygames">{{cite web | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/elite | title=Elite | publisher=[[mobygames.com]] | access-date=19 January 2015 }}</ref>

In the game universe, stars have single [[planet]]s, each with a [[space station]] in its [[orbit]]. Stars are always separated by [[interstellar travel|interstellar]] distances which cannot be crossed using the ship's sublight engines. Travel between stars is accomplished by hyperspace jumps, and is constrained to those within range of the limited fuel capacity (a maximum of 7 [[light year]]s) of the ship's hyperdrive. Sublight travel uses no fuel.<ref name="crash"/>

Fuel can be replenished after docking with a space station, which requires matching the ship's rotation to that of the station before entering the docking bay<ref name="postmortem"/>—a task that can be avoided by purchasing a docking computer. Equipment upgrades include a fuel scoop, which allows "sun skimming"—collecting energy from the stars' [[stellar corona|corona]]<ref name="crash"/>—described by the manual as "a dangerous and difficult activity", but in practice a fairly simple process far easier than manually docking at a space station—and collecting free-floating cargo canisters and escape capsules liberated after the destruction of other ships.<ref name="gamasutra_history">{{cite web | last = Barton | first = Matt |author2=Bill Loguidice | title = The History of Elite: Space, the Endless Frontier | website = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 7 April 2009 | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3983/the_history_of_elite_space_the_.php | access-date = 27 December 2009}}</ref>

While making a hyperspace jump between star systems, the antagonistic Thargoid<ref name=ma15/> race may intercept the player half way, forcing the player's ship to remain in "witch-space" and do battle with their smaller invasion ships. As the interrupted jump uses the full journey's fuel, the player may have insufficient fuel to subsequently jump to a nearby planet, trapping them in witch-space and they must use an escape capsule if owned, or abort the game and reload.<ref name="bellfaq2">{{cite web|title=Elite FAQ Ian Bell Autumn 1999|url=http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/elite/faq.htm|access-date=23 January 2015}}</ref>

An extremely expensive one-shot [[Hyperspace|galactic hyperspace]] upgrade permits travel between the eight galaxies of the game universe. There is little practical difference between the different galaxies. However, in some versions it is necessary to travel to at least the second galaxy to access the game's missions. The planetary layout of the galaxies is different, and many players discovered trade runs between closely positioned planets with fortuitous economic combinations.

Most versions of Elite included several optional missions for the Galactic Navy.<ref name=ma15>{{citation | url=https://archive.org/stream/MicroAdventurer15-Jan85#page/n14/mode/1up | title=An Elite Crew | journal=Micro Adventurer | date=January 1985 | issue=15 | page=15 }}</ref> One requires tracking down and destroying a stolen experimental ship;<ref name="zzap64"/> another involves transporting classified information on the Thargoids' home planet, with Thargoid invasion ships doing their best to see that the player does not succeed throughout the duration of the mission involving multiple interplanetary jumps.<ref name=elitefaq/> Rewards differed depending on the mission - from cash, gems to esoteric hardware such as a [[cloaking device]].

== Development ==
According to Braben and Bell, ''Elite'' was inspired by a range of sources.  The developers refer to ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' as influences. Braben also cites the works of [[Larry Niven]], [[Jerry Pournelle]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], [[Robert L. Forward]], [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Orson Scott Card]].<ref name="highscore">Rusell DeMaria, Johnny L. Wilson, ''High Score!: the illustrated history of electronic games'', p. 340-341</ref> While Bell has confirmed that some of the game's content was derived from the ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]'' [[tabletop role-playing game]], including the default commander name Jameson,<ref name=ma15/><ref name=trivia>{{cite web | url=http://www.hooplah.com/encounters/trivia.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530050948/http://www.hooplah.com/encounters/trivia.htm | archive-date=30 May 2006 | title=Elite Trivia | access-date=21 May 2006}}</ref> Braben has denied this several times.<ref name="postmortem"/><ref name="redditama">{{cite web|last=Braben|first=David|title=I am David Braben, co-creator of Elite, creator of Frontier, Frontier II and the upcoming Elite: Dangerous|date=30 December 2012|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15od2s/i_am_david_braben_cocreator_of_elite_creator_of/c7octww |publisher=[[Reddit AMA]] |access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref>

When the developers met at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], Bell was already working on a game for Acornsoft called ''Freefall''.<ref name="One1991_12">{{Citation | title = David Braben | journal = [[The One (magazine)|The One]] | issue=28 | pages=112 | date = January 1991 | publisher=[[EMAP]] | url=https://archive.org/stream/theone-magazine-28/TheOne_28_Jan_1991#page/n111/mode/2up}}</ref> Braben had started writing a game called ''Fighter'', but he had not yet completed it. The two projects were sufficiently similar that Braben and Bell compared notes, and after seeing ''[[Star Raiders]]'' on the [[Atari 800]] they decided to collaborate to produce what eventually became ''Elite''. They first approached Thorn EMI;<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">[https://web.archive.org/web/20140825111235/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/games/11051122/Elite-the-game-that-changed-the-world.html The Daily Telegraph]</ref> the company's rejection letter stated that the game was too complicated and needed to be finishable in 10 minutes with three [[life (gaming)|lives]]. Braben and Bell then met with Acornsoft; their demo of the ''Elite''{{'}}s combat and docking sequences impressed managing director [[David Johnson-Davies]] and other Acornsoft executives. The company agreed to publish the finished game, although the company feared that it was too ambitious for Braben and Bell, and was uncertain about the merits of two developers instead of one on a single game.<ref>{{cite web | title = Interview - From Outsider To Elite: In Conversation With David Braben | website = Gamasutra | date = 17 October 2005 | url = http://gamedeveloper.com/view/feature/130841/interview__from_outsider_to_.php}}</ref><ref name="motu_guardian">{{citation | last=Spufford | first=Francis | title=Masters of their universe, edited extract from Backroom Boys: The Secret Return Of The British Boffin | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/features.weekend | journal=The Guardian| location=London | date=18 October 2003 | isbn= 9780571214969}}</ref> The programmers were given a £1,000 advance from the company and a royalty rate of 7.5% was agreed.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/>

The game took two years to write and started out as a 3D arcade game without the trading element.<ref name="One1991_12"/> It was written in [[machine code]] using [[assembly language]],<ref name=edge>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/features.weekend|title=Masters of Their Universe|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Francis Spufford|date=18 October 2003 |access-date=8 May 2015}}</ref> giving much care to maximum compactness of code.

The original BBC version used a novel split screen approach to show four colours (five, including the black background) onscreen simultaneously; the upper two thirds of the screen were displayed in [[BBC Micro#Display modes|Mode 4]] while the lower part was in Mode 5.<ref name=YCNOV>{{citation | title=BBC Software | journal=Your Computer | date=November 1984 | page=60 | url=https://archive.org/stream/your-computer-magazine-1984-11/YourComputer_1984_11#page/n59/mode/2up }}</ref> The subsequent Electron version ran entirely in Mode 4, because the video chips were not 100% compatible and therefore was in black and white only.<ref name="postmortem"/>

The ''Elite'' universe contains eight galaxies, each with 256 planets to explore. Due to the limited capabilities of [[8-bit]] computers, these worlds are [[procedural generation|procedurally generated]]. A single seed number is run through a fixed algorithm the appropriate number of times and creates a sequence of numbers determining each planet's complete composition (position in the galaxy, prices of commodities, and name and local details; text strings are chosen numerically from a [[lookup table]] and assembled to produce unique descriptions, such as a planet with "carnivorous arts graduates"). This means that no extra memory is needed to store the characteristics of each planet, yet each is unique and has fixed properties. Each galaxy is also procedurally generated from the first. Braben and Bell at first intended to have 2<sup>48</sup> galaxies, but Acornsoft insisted on a smaller universe to hide the galaxies' mathematical origins.{{r|motu_guardian}}

However, the use of procedural generation created a few problems. There are a number of poorly located systems that can be reached only by galactic hyperspace— these are more than 7 light years from their nearest neighbour and being low-tech are unable to replace the galactic Hyperdrive, thus trapping the traveller. Braben and Bell also checked that none of the system names were [[profanity|profane]] - removing an entire galaxy after finding a planet named "[[wikt:arse|Arse]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-david-braben-from-elite-to-today/1100-6162140/ | title= Q&A: David Braben--from Elite to today | website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref>

The developers did not spend much time playing their creation and the quality testing was mostly performed by Acornsoft's managing director, David Johnson-Davies, who also planned the packaging and marketing campaign at the time.<ref name=ma14_20/><ref name="maherelite2013">{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2013/12/elite/ | title=Elite (or, The Universe on 32 K Per Day) | work=The Digital Antiquarian | date=26 December 2013 | access-date=26 January 2015 | last=Maher | first=Jimmy}}</ref>

The original BBC Micro disk version uses a non-standard disk-format for [[copy protection]]. This relied on specific OSWORD &7F DFS [[opcode]]s in the [[Intel]] 8271 [[floppy-disk controller]] to directly access the disk, and produce a non-standard sector/track-layout. This causes issues for legitimate customers that use the [[Western Digital]] 1770 disk-controller (DFS) ROMs from third-party manufacturers such as [[Watford Electronics]]. Acorn subsequently released alternative versions of the BBC disks that are compatible with the [[WD1770]]. In addition to this, self-modifying code was used as part of the protection system, created by Rob Northen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zakalwe.fi/~shd/amiga-cracking/rob_northen_interview.txt | title=Rob Northen Interview}}</ref> This BBC disk-copy-protection was also used by Superior Software in its ''[[Exile (1988 video game)|Exile]]'' game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exile.acornarcade.com/devel.html |title=Exile Disk Copy protection }}</ref>

Acornsoft set in motion a large-scale publicity campaign and commissioned a presentational package for the game that was far more elaborate than normal.  Acornsoft packaged ''Elite'' in a box larger than its usual releases, complete with a [[novella]] by [[Robert Holdstock]] called ''The Dark Wheel'', a 64-page Space Trader's Flight Training Manual, reference card and a ship identification poster. The flight training manual was written in a style that took the rookie trader through the controls and various aspects of play.<ref name=ma14_20/>

''The Dark Wheel'' was the first novella to be included for distribution with a video game.<ref name=cvgchanged>{{cite web| url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=78368| title = Games that changed the world: Elite | work = Computer & Video Games | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211011328/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=78368 | archive-date=11 February 2007}}</ref> The original Acornsoft version promised on its back cover that "[a] sequel to the novella is planned for publication in 1985", but no direct sequel was ever written. A second novella, ''Imprint'' by Andy Redman, was included with the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] release of ''Elite Plus'', but apart from being set in the same universe it is in no way connected to the original story.

Marketing activities included a £50,000 promotional budget from Acornsoft, including television advertising<ref name=ma15/> and a launch party at the [[Thorpe Park]] theme park (holding such an event for a video game was almost unheard of at the time) and a competition to be among the first to achieve the status of "Elite".<ref name=YCNOV/><ref>{{citation | title=Hal Joins the Elite | journal=Your Computer | date=December 1984 | page=50 | url=https://archive.org/stream/your-computer-magazine-1984-12/YourComputer_1984_12#page/n49/mode/1up }}</ref>

=== ''The Dark Wheel'' ===
The story tells of a young starship pilot named Alex Ryder, whose father Jason is killed when their merchant ship is attacked by a notorious pirate. In trying to understand and avenge his father's death and achieve an "iron ass" (a space-trader's term for a well-armed- and armoured spaceship), Alex encounters the basics of the Elite universe—including combat, hyperdrive and hyperspace and the deadly aliens called Thargoids. Finally Alex discovers the truth about his father and his combat rank. He also acts as an acceptable face of trading as his female co-pilot, Elyssia Fields, is an alien and wanted in several systems. Alex wants to avenge his father's death, but must exercise caution in tracking down the assassin. By trading commodities, he slowly improves the arms and armour of his ship. When he is competent at using the spaceship for combat, but before he feels ready, he makes a trade that is sure to bring his father's killer to him.

Alex also learns what the "Dark Wheel" is and what it takes to join its ranks.<ref name="ianbell">{{cite web |url=http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/elite/ | title=Ian Bell's Elite site}}</ref>

As well as such gameplay enhancements, the version also exploited the more modern hardware by using [[polygon mesh]] graphics in place of the wire-frames.

The editors called it "a classic game that mixes solid 3D space combat with trading to create a universe in which you can spend many a happy half-hour bushwhacking the dastardly Thargoids."<ref name=pcformat50>{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[PC Format]] | title=The 50 best games EVER! |date=October 1991 | issue=1 | pages=109–111 }}</ref>

''Elite'' has often been regarded as defining the genre for [[Space trading and combat game|space trading]] games. Since its release ''Elite'' has been credited as being the title that defined the modern space flight simulation genre, a significant source of inspiration for later games in the genre<ref name=eg_xbtf/><ref name=gamasutra_history/><ref name=gzone_ss>{{cite web | last = Eberle | first = Matt | title = Star Sonata Review | publisher = GameZone | date = 17 November 2004 | url = http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/star_sonata_pc_review | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120403015039/http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/star_sonata_pc_review | archive-date = 3 April 2012 | access-date = 18 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=eg_dso>{{cite web | last = Gillen | first = Kieron | title = Darkstar One Review | website = [[Eurogamer]] | date = 17 July 2006 | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_darkstarone_pc | access-date = 19 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=vg_dso>{{cite web | last = Vandervell | first = Andrew | title = DarkStar One Review for PC | publisher = VideoGamer.com | date = 16 August 2006 | url = http://www.videogamer.com/pc/darkstar_one/review.html | access-date = 19 June 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720062324/http://www.videogamer.com/pc/darkstar_one/review.html | archive-date = 20 July 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref> as well as being influential upon gaming as a whole.<ref name=gspy_hof>{{cite web | last = Williams | first = Bryn | title = GameSpy.com - Hall of Fame: Elite | publisher = [[GameSpy]] | date = September 2000 | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/halloffame/september00/elite/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080211093746/http://archive.gamespy.com/halloffame/september00/elite/ | archive-date = 11 February 2008 | access-date = 20 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=75 Power Players|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=50|quote=It was one of the very first games to feature 3D graphics, but more importantly it challenged the definition of what a computer game was.}}</ref> In interviews, senior producers of [[CCP Games]] have cited ''Elite'' as one of the inspirations for their acclaimed [[MMORPG]], ''[[EVE Online]]''.<ref name=eve_rpgv>{{cite web | last1 = Jonric | title = EVE Interview | publisher = [[RPGVault]] | date = 1 August 2000 | url = http://rpgvaultarchive.ign.com/features/interviews/eve.shtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131107173136/http://rpgvaultarchive.ign.com/features/interviews/eve.shtml | archive-date = 7 November 2013 | url-status = dead | access-date = 19 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=eve_gama>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2411/interview_evolution_and_risk_ccp_.php | title=Evolution and Risk: CCP on the Freedoms of EVE Online | website=Gamasutra | access-date=5 August 2007}}</ref><ref name=eve_pcgamer>{{cite magazine | title = The Making of EVE Online | magazine = [[PC Gamer]] | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/01/24/the-making-of-eve-online/ | access-date = 24 January 2011}}</ref> The developers of ''[[Jumpgate Evolution]]'',<ref name=mmog_jgdd>{{cite web | last = Hartmeyer | first = Steve | title = Dev Diary: The Inspirations Behind Jumpgate Evolution | publisher = [[The MMO Gamer]] | date = 13 February 2008 | url = http://www.mmogamer.com/02/13/2008/dev-diary-the-inspirations-behind-jumpgate-evolution | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080404005634/http://www.mmogamer.com/02/13/2008/dev-diary-the-inspirations-behind-jumpgate-evolution | url-status = dead | archive-date = 4 April 2008 | access-date = 20 June 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> ''[[Battlecruiser 3000AD]]'',<ref name=lg_bc3d>{{cite web | last = Bergman | first = Jason | title = Serious Brass Ones (A peek inside the world of Derek Smart) | publisher = [[looneygames]] | url = http://www.loonygames.com/content/1.27/feat/ | access-date = 20 June 2008}}</ref> ''[[Infinity (MMOG)|Infinity: The Quest for Earth]]'',<ref name=moddb_iqe>{{cite web | last = Johnson | first = Joe | title = Infinity: Quest for the Earth | publisher = [[ModDB]] | date = 9 February 2006 | url = http://www.moddb.com/features/23760/infinity-quest-for-the-earth | access-date = 20 June 2008}}</ref>

In November 1999, on the game's 15th birthday, Ian Bell released many binaries and [[source code]] of several versions of the original game on his website.<ref>[http://www.sslmit.unibo.it/zat/frontier.htm Ian Bell's Elite pages - November 1999 : Elite 15th Anniversary - Released the program sources]</ref><ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001118113900/http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/clara.net/i/a/n/iancgbell/webspace/elite/archive/index.htm |archive-date=18 November 2000 |url=http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/clara.net/i/a/n/iancgbell/webspace/elite/archive/index.htm |title=Elite Archives ----The Files---- |last=Bell |first=Ian |work=iancgbell.clara.net |date=1 November 1999 |access-date=6 November 2015}}</ref> A dispute arose between Bell and David Braben regarding Bell's decision to make available all versions of the original ''Elite''.<ref>[http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/elite/cix/index.htm David Braben's Legal Threats to the Elite Home Page] on Ian Bell's webpage (updated 19/09/14)</ref> The dispute has since ended and the various versions became available again on Bell's site.<ref name="redditama" /><ref name="eyetoeye">{{cite web | title=Bell and Braben See Eye-to-eye as Original Elite Sees Dual Re-release | date = 25 September 2014 | publisher=cabume.co.uk | url=http://www.cabume.co.uk/software/bell-and-braben-see-eye-to-eye-as-classic-eighties-video-game-elite-sees-dual-re-release.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413091114/http://www.cabume.co.uk/software/bell-and-braben-see-eye-to-eye-as-classic-eighties-video-game-elite-sees-dual-re-release.html |archive-date=13 April 2015}}</ref>

In the late 1980s a variant of the commercial BBC Micro ''Elite'' release was created by Angus Duggan by [[disassembly|disassembling]] and modifying the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] code from the existing with many extra features, originally titled ''Elite III'' but now known as ''Elite A'' to minimise confusion.  It includes many more ship types, more ship types flyable by the player (who begins in the less capable Adder), cargo delivery missions, some extra equipment items and numerous gameplay improvements. ''Elite A'' was released publicly in 1997.<ref>{{cite web | title=Elite-A - an extended version of Elite for the BBC Microcomputer | url=http://knackered.petestack.com/beeb/elite.html | access-date=23 January 2015 | archive-date=5 March 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305152009/http://knackered.petestack.com/beeb/elite.html | url-status=dead }}</ref> Like the original game, it can be downloaded free from Ian Bell's web site and played under emulation.

Many attempts to develop [[Clone (computing)|clones]] of ''Elite'' have been made, but most have been abandoned before completion or have otherwise failed to come to fruition. The [[Open-source software|open source]] ''[[Oolite (video game)|Oolite]]'' is a notable exception.
