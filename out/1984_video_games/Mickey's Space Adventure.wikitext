'''''Mickey's Space Adventure''''' is a graphic adventure game for a number of platforms. It was designed by [[Roberta Williams]] and released by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]] in 1984.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allowe.com/downloads/games.html|title=Games - Al Lowe's Humor Site|website=allowe.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref> It features the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]].

==Plot==
The plot involves an alien race losing a precious crystal that contains all of their recorded history, split into nine pieces and hidden throughout Earth's solar system. While out walking Pluto, Mickey Mouse stumbles upon a spaceship sent by the aliens and is charged with searching the planets (and several moons) for the pieces of the crystal.

==Development==
Written in 1984 by Roberta Williams, the game was a joint project with Disney prior to their collaboration on ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)#Video game|The Black Cauldron]]''. The game was intended for children. While there were several similar games featuring Disney characters, ''Mickey's Space Adventure'' is not considered part of a larger series. The PC version was released on two 360 KB 5Â¼" disks.
