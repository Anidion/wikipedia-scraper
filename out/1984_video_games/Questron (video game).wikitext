==Gameplay==
[[File:Questron C64.png|thumbnail|left|Outside Geraldtown (C64)]]
In the first ''Questron'' game, the player takes on the role of a young serf who tries to make a name for himself by traveling the realm in order to gain the power and experience necessary to defeat the wicked "Mantor", ruler of the "Land of Evil".

The view is mostly in [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] style for the world maps and town encounters, but switches to a first-person style in the dungeons of the Land of Evil. Some features were novel for a game of its type at the time of its release. First there are two "games within a game" that allow the character to permanently increase dexterity or intelligence attributes if completed successfully. Also, various casinos about the towns allow the player to gamble for gold pieces in games of [[blackjack]], [[roulette]], and [[double or nothing]].

Various monsters and foes are immune or more vulnerable to different weapons. The player would occasionally have to switch weapons depending on which enemy they faced in order to defeat them. Magic spells can also be cast, but only in the dungeon levels.

==Reception==
''Questron'' was SSI's first RPG, and became the fastest-selling new game in the company's history at almost 35,000 copies in North America, more than triple the sales of the typical SSI game. Others followed, such as ''[[Phantasie (video game)|Phantasie]]'', ''[[Wizard's Crown]]'', ''[[Gemstone Warrior]]'', and the ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[Gold Box]] games.<ref name="maher20160318">{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2016/03/opening-the-gold-box-part-3-from-tabletop-to-desktop/ | title=Opening the Gold Box, Part 3: From Tabletop to Desktop | publisher=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2016-03-18 | access-date=19 March 2016 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}</ref>

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1984 wrote that "if you are in need of a new and challenging role-playing game similar in play to the ''Ultima'' scenarios, then look no further". James A. McPherson praised the 3-D dungeons and "an ending fit for a king", and concluded that "the differences from the ''Ultima'' type game do make ''Questron'' refreshing. I await the sequels".<ref name="mcpherson198406">{{cite magazine | title=Questron | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1984 | author=McPherson, James A. | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&pub=2&id=16 | pages=18 | type=review}}</ref> The magazine's [[Scorpia (journalist)|Scorpia]] in 1991 and 1993 also liked the game and praised the ending.<ref name="scorpia199110">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 | title=C*R*P*G*S / Computer Role-Playing Game Survey | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1991 | access-date=18 November 2013 | author=Scorpia | author-link=Scorpia (journalist) | pages=16}}</ref><ref name="scorpia199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Scorpia's Magic Scroll Of Games | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | access-date=25 March 2016 | author=Scorpia | author-link=Scorpia (journalist) | pages=34–50}}</ref> ''[[Ahoy!]]'' in 1985 praised the Commodore 64 version of ''Questron'', describing it as "one of those game that you start playing and suddenly realize it's three hours past bedtime.
