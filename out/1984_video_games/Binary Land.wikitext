{{nihongo|'''''Binary Land'''''|バイナリィランド|Bainarī Rando}} is a [[puzzle video game|puzzle]] video game developed by [[Hudson Soft]] in 1983 for the [[MSX]], [[FM-7]], [[NEC PC-6001]], [[NEC PC-8801]], and in 1985 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]]. The MSX version saw release in [[Japan]] by Hudson Soft and in [[Europe]] by Kuma Computers Ltd in 1984.

While the Famicom version has 99 levels, there is no ending screen implemented in the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ending information (Famicom version) |language=Japanese|url=http://www25.atwiki.jp/famicomall/pages/1114.html|publisher=FC no Game Seiha Shimasho|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

In the Famicom version of the game, players have to unite two [[penguin]]s, Gurin (male) and Malon (female), who are in love.<ref name="geocitiesjp">{{cite web|title=Top score list/basic gameplay information|language=Japanese|url=http://www.geocities.jp/frnyanko/setsumei/famicom/binaryland/binaryland.html|publisher=Geocities.jp|accessdate=2013-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006062148/http://www.geocities.jp/frnyanko/setsumei/famicom/binaryland/binaryland.html|archive-date=2018-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The MSX version features a human boy and a human girl; gameplay remains identical to the Famicom version. Players control Malon and Gurin simultaneously, with a timer adding to the difficulty. These penguins move in mirror images of each other.<ref name="geocitiesjp"/> After completing the 17th stage, players have to start over again on stage 1. ''[[Je te veux]]'' by [[Erik Satie]] is the [[background music]] in the game during the levels. Upon uniting the two penguins, Beethoven's "[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ode to Joy]]" is played.

A top-down view is used in the game, similar to the method used in ''[[Adventures of Lolo|The Adventures of Lolo]]''. Standing in the penguins' paths are [[spider]]s, birds and other creatures which the player must attack with the penguins' spray.<ref name="geocitiesjp"/> [[Spider web|Cobwebs]] occupy some of the cells on the playing field, possibly slowing the player down long enough for a spider to kill either Gurin or Malon. With each level arranged on a 10-by-15 grid and a vertical wall separating the two penguins from each other, only the upper central cell is free for both characters to reach. This "free cell" always holds the [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]]d heart that is required to complete the level. A row of walls surrounds each player in a maze-like environment. In order to make the challenges more difficult, they are unbalanced and offer a different experience for Gurin and Malon. Should Gurin or Malon become trapped in a cobweb, they are helpless until the player navigates the maze, crosses the free cell and then enters the other penguin's side of the maze to free them from the web with their spraycan.

Should the player reach a high enough score, the player is asked to put their name on a list of the five [[high score|highest scores]] of that session.<ref name="geocitiesjp"/>
