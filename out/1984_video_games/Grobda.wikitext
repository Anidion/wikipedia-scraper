{{nihongo foot|'''''Grobda'''''|グロブダー|Gurobudā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1984 [[multidirectional shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Namco]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grobda - Videogame by Namco|url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8015|access-date=2020-12-27|website=www.arcade-museum.com}}</ref> It is a spin-off from ''[[Xevious]]'', as the player's tank first appeared in that game as an enemy. It runs on [[Namco Super Pac-Man]] hardware but with a video system like that used in ''[[Mappy]]'' and ''[[The Tower of Druaga]]'', and it also uses a [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] for the "Get Ready" speech sample at the start of each round.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Grobda.gif|left|thumb|The player avoiding collision from enemy projectiles.]]
''Grobda'' is a [[shoot 'em up|multi-directional shooter]] similar to the classic [[Atari 2600]] game ''[[Combat (1977 video game)|Combat]]'' (1977).<ref name="Allgame"/><ref name="Edge">{{cite news |title=Retroview - Namco Museum Volume 2 |url=https://archive.org/details/edgeuk032?q=Grobda |accessdate=13 June 2020 |agency=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |issue=32 |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |date=April 1996 |page=88}}</ref> The plot involves humans using powerful, laser-emitting vehicles in a dangerous competitive sport known as "battling", thousands of years in the future. In the game, the player assumes control of the Grobda, a [[screw-propelled vehicle|screw-propelled]] tank capable of firing laser beams at enemies. The objective of each level, known in-game as "battlings", is to destroy all of the enemies while dodging their projectiles as quickly as possible.<ref name="HG101"/> There are 99 levels total, each becoming progressively more difficult.<ref>{{cite news |title=Namco Museum Vol. 2 |url=https://archive.org/details/Edge_UK_029?q=grobda |accessdate=13 June 2020 |agency=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |issue=29 |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |date=February 1995 |page=89}}</ref>

Grobda's laser weapon is capable of destroying most enemies in one hit, although some carry shields that require additional shots to destroy.<ref>{{cite news |title=Special Oldies - Back to the Future |url=https://archive.org/details/MegaFun0696?q=Grobda |accessdate=13 June 2020 |agency=MegaFun |date=June 1996 |pages=93–92 |language=German}}</ref> When an enemy is destroyed, it causes an explosion that will destroy any other enemies in its blast radius, including Grobda.<ref name="HG101"/> The remains of the enemy are left in its place, which cause the Grobda to slow down if they move over them. Grobda has its own shield that briefly protects them from enemy fire, indicated by the meter at the bottom of the screen.<ref name="HG101"/> The shield disappears if it is inflicted with enough damage, and does not refill until the next round.

==Development==
[[File:Grobda_comparison.png|thumb|The eponymous Grobda was originally an enemy in ''[[Xevious]]'' (1983), where it evaded the player's air-to-surface bombs.]]
''Grobda'' was designed by [[Masanobu Endo]] and a small team of developers within [[Namco]]. Endo is best known as the creator of ''[[Xevious]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Tower of Druaga]]'' (1984), two widely-successful arcade games from the 1980s; most of the developers behind ''Grobda'' had worked on both titles.<ref name="AAN"/> The Grobda was originally a defenseless enemy in ''Xevious'' that attempted to evade the player's air-to-surface bombs. Endo believed that the idea of giving Grobda powerful weapons and attacks was a humorous idea, and made for an interesting game concept.<ref name="AAN">{{cite book |author1=Microcomputer BASIC Editorial Department |title=All About Namco |date=December 1986 |publisher=Dempa Shimbun |isbn=978-4885541070 |language=Japanese}}</ref> The game was planned and completed in three months, one of the shortest development times for a Namco game, and was developed on a small budget.<ref name="AAN"/> The soundtrack was composed by Yuriko Keino, known for her work on games such as ''[[Dig Dug]]'' (1982).<ref>{{cite news |title=『ディグダグ』の音楽はBGMでなく歩行音。慶野由利子さんが語る80年代ナムコのゲームサウンド（動画あり） - ライブドアニュース |url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/5808176/ |accessdate=11 May 2019 |work=[[Livedoor|Livedoor News]] |date=24 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103427/http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/5808176/ |archivedate=22 December 2015 |language=ja}}</ref> She envisioned the tempo for the background humming to become faster as the Grobda moved faster around the playfield. The current-sound hardware was unable to accomplish this, so Keino wrote a custom program that enabled it.<ref name="STG">{{cite news |title=シューティングゲームサイドvol.5 慶野由利子インタビュー |agency=Shooting Gameside |volume=5 |publisher=Micro Magazine |date=7 June 2012 |language=Japanese}}</ref>
