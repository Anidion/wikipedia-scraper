'''''Tornado Low Level''''' (also known as '''''T.L.L.''''') is a multidirectional flight game developed by [[Costa Panayi]] and published in 1984 by the company he co-founded, [[Vortex Software]]. The game was first released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], and later ported to the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Commodore 64]].

The game has the player control a [[Panavia Tornado]] fighter jet, tasked to destroy targets throughout the map. ''Tornado Low Level'' received positive reviews for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions by video game critics, both on release and in retrospective reviews. The game was also a commercial success, with the Spectrum version debuting at number three on ''[[Personal Computer Games]]''{{'}} top fifty charts. The success of the game led to a sequel titled ''[[Cyclone (video game)|Cyclone]]'', which featured a similar graphical style and similar play.

==Gameplay==
[[File:TLL gameplay.png|thumb|left|Flying towards a target to destroy.]]
The player controls a [[Panavia Tornado]] fighter jet and must manoeuvre the plane at low altitude in order to destroy targets on the landscape by flying low over them at high speed, while avoiding [[Electricity pylon|pylons]], bridges, and other structures. Each target is represented as a small circle.<ref name="AAction"/> After five targets are destroyed, new targets are placed in more difficult positions, such as on the water.<ref name="CRASH"/>

Before a level begins, the map of the area is shown, with the five targets being highlighted.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Your Spectrum]]|title=TLL Tornado Low Level|last1=Holman|first1=Ross|last2=Nicholls|first2=Dave|pages=43–47|issue=8|date=October 1984|url=https://archive.org/details/your-spectrum-magazine-08/page/n43}}</ref> Each level has a time limit, while the Tornado has a limited fuel supply and can only carry ten bombs. Running low on fuel and time causes a warning sound to be triggered. Landing on the airfield refuels the aircraft.<ref name="AAction"/> The Tornado has two speeds. At high speed, it can travel to targets faster, but it uses fuel at a much greater rate. This is depicted graphically by the plane's wings being swept back. The screen displays a fuel gauge, [[altimeter]], a map of the game, and the time the player has left.<ref name="SUser2"/>

The 3D aspect of the game allows the Tornado to not only move on the x-axis (left/right on screen) and the y-axis (up/down on screen), but also on the z-axis, representing the height of the plane in the sky. This movement is supported graphically by allowing the Tornado to fly underneath bridges, with the plane temporarily disappearing from view as it does so. Telephone lines can also be flown under in the same way. Additionally, when the Tornado flies over a building, its shadow "climbs" up the wall, again giving the illusion of a third dimension.<ref name="SUser1" />

==Development==
''Tornado Low Level'' was developed by [[Costa Panayi]] and published by the [[United Kingdom]]-based company [[Vortex Software]], co-founded by Panayi. Before getting into game development, he was a [[design engineer]] for [[British Aerospace]]. The idea for the game originated from the popularity of [[Psion (company)|Psion]]'s [[flight simulator]] program [[Flight Simulation (Psion software)|''Flight Simulation'']]. Panayi considered the game to be a "progression of the ideas" he had in his previous title ''[[Android Two]]''.<ref name="SUser1">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Sinclair User]]|title=Flying Low|last=Bourne|first=Chris|issue=32|pages=138–139|date=November 1984|url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-032/SinclairUser_032_Nov_1984#page/n137/}}</ref> It was originally released for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984.<ref name="RPS">{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/22/the-flare-path-a-tornado-miscellany/|title=The Flare Path: A Tornado Miscellany|last=Stone|first=Tim|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=22 February 2019|access-date=27 March 2019|archive-date=26 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326162557/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/22/the-flare-path-a-tornado-miscellany/|url-status=live}}</ref> Publisher [[Ocean Software]] later acquired the rights to the game to release it for the [[Commodore 64]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|title=Designer of the Month|page=24|issue=36|date=October 1984|url=https://archive.org/details/ComputerAndVideoGamesIssue036Oct84/page/n23}}</ref> An [[Amstrad CPC]] version was also released, rewritten to use the full capabilities of the computer.
