'''''Battle Through Time''''' is a [[computer game]] for the [[Commodore 64]] computer, programmed by Ken Grant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=237|title = Lemon64 - Battle Through Time}}</ref> This video game is a side-scrolling ground-based [[shoot 'em up]] game drawing obvious influence from the arcade game ''[[Moon Patrol]]''.

==Gameplay==

The basic gameplay is similar to ''Moon Patrol'', in that the player has to drive a [[jeep]] through rough landscape and jump over potholes and obstacles, and shoot at enemies both on the ground and in the sky.<ref name=bigK /> The player has to travel ten miles in each level before they can progress to the next one.<ref name=HCW />

''Battle Through Time'' is themed after the most famous [[war]]s in the 20th century. It has seven levels, each with their own settings:
# ''[[World War I]]''
# ''[[World War II]]''
# ''The [[Korean War]]''
# ''The [[Vietnam War]]''
# ''[[World War III]]''
# ''War Mutations'',<ref name=cgamer /> an alien-looking landscape almost devoid of enemies, only riddled with obstacles
# ''In the Beginning'', back to [[Stone Age]], with a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' as an end-of-level [[boss (video games)|boss]].

Each level has its own [[music]] theme, which consist of computer renditions of various famous melodies, such as ''Symphony #5'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]<ref name=cgamer /> and ''[[The Blue Danube]]'' by [[Johann Strauss the Younger]], and contemporary classics such as the ''[[Darth Vader]]'' theme.
