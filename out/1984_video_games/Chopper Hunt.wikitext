==Development==
ANALOG Software, the game publishing label of Atari 8-bit magazine ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'', published ''Buried Bucks'' in 1982 with the name stylized as ''Buried Buck$''. Programmer Tom Hudson documented the expanding explosion effect used in the game as an article in ''ANALOG Computing'', including the assembly language source code.<ref name=violence/> The same effect was used in another game for the magazine: ''Planetary Defense''.<ref name=defense/> Hudson later told ''Atari Explorer'' that ''Buried Bucks'' was his first Atari 8-bit game and called it "pretty simplistic."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jainschigg |first1=John |title=Gradus ad Parnassum |journal=Atari Explorer |date=December 1986 |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=44 |url=https://archive.org/details/Atari_Explorer_Volume_6_Number_3_1986-12_Atari_Explorer_Publications_US/page/n45}}</ref>

The 1984 Imagic release changed the name to ''Chopper Hunt'' and made some alterations to the visuals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Buried Buck$, Chopper Hunt - gameplay, compare |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3DoUNxPS0U |website=YouTube}}</ref> A Commodore 64 port was published simultaneously.

==Reception==
As part of a "Five Great Games for the Atari" article in 1983, [[John J. Anderson]] reviewed ''Buried Bucks'': "once in a while a package appears that takes a unique premise and develops it into a new game that bears little resemblance to anything that has come before."<ref name=anderson/> He commented, "The level of graphics and sound in the program is utterly professional."<ref name=anderson/> ''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' also reviewed the original release, concluding, "This is a cute premise with no promise. My main complaint is that this game is boring. It goes too quickly from ridiculously easy to impossible, and along the way It completely fails to capture your attention or provide excitement for any prolonged gameplay".<ref name=efun/>

In a 1985 review of the Imagic version in ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'', Jack Powell wrote, "''Chopper Hunt'' would make a very nice public domain game," and "If you plunk down your hard-earned money for this outdated arcade game, you are helping to prove that [[P. T. Barnum|Barnum]] is right."<ref name="powell">{{cite journal |last1=Powell |first1=Jack |title=Product Reviews: Chopper Hunt |journal=Antic |date=November 1985 |volume=4 |issue=7 |page=77 |url=https://archive.org/details/1985-11-anticmagazine/page/n77}}</ref>
