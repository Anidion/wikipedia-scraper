'''''Trollie Wallie''''' is a [[platform game]] for the [[Commodore 64]] written by Andrew Challis and published in 1984 by [[Interceptor Micros]]. An [[Amstrad CPC]] port was released in 1986. ''Trollie Wallie'' is a sequel to ''[[Wheelin' Wallie]]'' from the same year.

==Gameplay==
''Trollie Wallie'' takes place inside a labyrinthine [[supermarket]] where ladders, slides, and conveyor belts to form a devilish maze. Nightmarish creatures wander around inside the supermarket. Numerous items are scattered around.  It is the job of Wallie, guided by the player, to take every item to the checkout counter.

The game is played over one large map, which scrolls in any direction as needed by Wallie's movement. Wallie starts from the lower left corner and the checkout counter is at the lower right corner.

Wallie can only carry a maximum of five items at a time, at which point they have to be taken to the checkout counter.<ref name="gamefaqs">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/c64/572103-trollie-wallie|title = Trollie Wallie for Commodore 64 - GameFAQs}}</ref> Because of this, the player must learn to divide the game play into several trips. Forty items must be collected in order to complete the game.<ref name="gamefaqs"/>

The background music for ''Trollie Wallie'' consists of versions of ''[[Popcorn (instrumental)|Popcorn]]'' by [[Hot Butter]] and ''[[Equinoxe|Equinoxe (part 5, 6 and 7)]]'' by [[Jean Michel Jarre]]. It was arranged by Graham Hansford.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}
