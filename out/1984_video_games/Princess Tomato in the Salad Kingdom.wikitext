{{nihongo|'''''Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom'''''|サラダの国のトマト姫|''Sarada no Kuni no Tomato Hime''}} is a [[video game]] by [[Hudson Soft]] originally released in 1984 for the [[NEC PC-8801]], [[NEC PC-6001]], [[FM-7]] and [[MSX]] Japanese [[home computer]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamepres.org/pc88/library/frame1.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129172526/http://www.gamepres.org/pc88/library/frame1.htm |archive-date=2016-11-29 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://p6-kei.hp.infoseek.co.jp:80/Hudson2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628130935/http://p6-kei.hp.infoseek.co.jp/Hudson2.html|archivedate=June 28, 2007|title=PC-6001「ハドソン１」|date=June 28, 2007|access-date=May 11, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fm-7.com/museum/softhouse/hudsonsoft/500707600.html|title=Oh!FM-7：サラダの国のトマト姫（ハドソンソフト）|website=fm-7.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://msx.jpn.org/tagoo/s_check.cgi?LINE=491|title=Tagoo: MSXソフトウエア検索: サラダの国のトマト姫|website=msx.jpn.org}}</ref>

It was ported on May 27, 1988, to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]], and February 8, 1991<ref>[http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/NES/princess_tomato_in_the_salad_kingdom/ Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom Review & Resources] - neoseeker.com, accessed August 20, 2007</ref> for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America. It was also released on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on January 19, 2010, and in North America on February 8.

The characters are primarily cartoon-like [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] fruits and vegetables, though the game does contain some human characters, including Princess Tomato's sister, Lisa, and the villainous Farmies.

==Plot==
[[Image:Orange park.jpg|thumb|left|The Garlic Wanderer in Orange Park.]]
Taking the role of Sir Cucumber, a knight, the player is assigned by  King Broccoli (now deceased) to defeat the evil Minister Pumpkin, who has kidnapped Princess Tomato. Early on, Sir Cucumber gains a sidekick, Percy the baby [[persimmon]], who offers advice and helps throughout the quest (and always refers to Sir Cucumber as "Boss").

==Gameplay==
''Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom'' plays similarly to a [[text adventure]], though due to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]'s lack of a keyboard accessory, the possible commands are represented by buttons which line both sides of the screen. The commands are fixed and do not change during gameplay. Primarily, the game consists of still screens, with the exception of the [[Rock paper scissors|"finger wars"]], mazes and occasional animated character, such as the octoberry and fernbirds. Players can issue commands to the game's protagonist. While the player may run into difficulty determining which actions will advance the game, the only way to "lose" is by failing to defeat the second-to-last boss, Minister Pumpkin, in a penultimate game of "finger wars".

== Legacy ==
Princess Tomato makes an appearance in ''[[Super Bomberman R]]'' as a playable [[Downloadable content|DLC]] character named "Princess Tomato Bomber". She was added in the 2.0 update released in November 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Super Bomberman R Official Website|url=https://www.konami.com/games/bomberman/r/|access-date=2020-10-27|website=Super Bomberman R Official Website|language=en}}</ref>
