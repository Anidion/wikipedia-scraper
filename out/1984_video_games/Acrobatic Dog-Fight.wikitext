In ''Acrobatic Dog-Fight'' the playing field is limited with a ceiling and ground as well as an ultimate destination to navigate to. ''Acrobatic Dog-Fight'' also adds two buttons, a secondary weapon and an eject button. Eject can be used at any time and makes it possible to hijack enemy planes and continue flying them. If the pilot fails to hijack an enemy plane he would parachute to the ground where a standard plane waits nearby.
