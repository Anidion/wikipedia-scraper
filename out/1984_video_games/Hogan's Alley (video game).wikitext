{{nihongo foot|'''''Hogan's Alley'''''|ホーガンズアレイ|Hōganzu Arei|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[light gun shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]]. It was released for the [[Family Computer]] in 1984 and then the arcade [[Nintendo VS. System]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1985. It was one of the first hit video games to use a [[light gun]] as an input device, along with Nintendo's ''[[Duck Hunt]]'' (1984). The game presents players with "cardboard cut-outs" of gangsters and innocent civilians. The player must shoot the gangs and spare the innocent people. It was a major arcade hit in the United States and Europe.

The name is derived from an [[Hogan's Alley (FBI)#History|epynomous]] [[shooting range]] on the grounds of the Special Police School at [[Camp Perry]], a training facility for the [[National Guard of the United States]] that was organised in 1920 in association with the [[National Rifle Association]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Surprising Comic Origins of a Classic Nintendo Video Game|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=Mar 8, 2017|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|url=https://www.cbr.com/hogans-alley-nintendo-fbi-yellow-kid/}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Hogan's Alley Screenshot NES.png|thumb|left|A wall round. The middle target is a gangster who must be shot; the woman and police officer to either side must be left alone.]]

The game begins with three cardboard cutouts moving into position against a blank wall and turning to face the player. The cutouts display a mixture of gangsters and innocent/friendly people; the player must react quickly and shoot only the gangsters. In later rounds, the backdrop changes from the blank wall to a city block, with some cutouts already exposed as they emerge into view. The player is confronted with five cutouts in each of these latter rounds.

After five rounds apiece in the wall and city block, a bonus round is played. Here, the player has a limited supply of ammunition with which to shoot up to ten tin cans thrown from one side of the screen, trying to bounce them onto ledges at the opposite side for points. After this round, the player returns to the wall rounds and the game continues at an increased speed.

Shooting an innocent person, or failing to shoot a gangster, costs the player one life, which is indicated by the "MISS" counter incrementing by one. No lives can be lost in the bonus round. When all lives are lost, indicated by the "MISS" counter reaching 10 or more, the game is over.

==Release==
The game is available on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and as a [[Nintendo VS. System]] Game Pak, which was installed into VS. System Arcade cabinets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsarcade.com/nintendo_vs_ppu_info.php|title=Nintendo Vs. Unisystem Nintendo Vs.

In the United States, ''Hogan's Alley'' was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1985 as one of the original 17 launch titles for the system. There are three modes: "Hogan's Alley A" (the blank wall), "Hogan's Alley B" (the town), and "Trick Shot" (shooting soda cans to bounce them onto ledges).

==Ports==
A modified version of ''Hogan's Alley'' using the [[Wii Remote]] in place of the NES Zapper was released for the [[Wii U Virtual Console]] on January 7, 2016 in North America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hogans-alley-wii-u/|title=Hogan's Alley for Wii U - Nintendo Game Details}}</ref>

==Reception==
In North America, the arcade version of ''Hogan's Alley'' became popular and popularized light gun video games along with ''Duck Hunt'' in 1985.<ref name="Adlum">{{cite magazine |last=Adlum |first=Eddie |title=The Replay Years: Reflections from Eddie Adlum |magazine=RePlay |date=November 1985 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=134-175 (170-1) |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-11-issue-no.-2-november-1985-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2011%2C%20Issue%20No.%202%20-%20November%201985/page/170/mode/2up}}</ref> In the United States, ''Hogan's Alley'' had topped the ''RePlay'' arcade charts by November 1985<ref>{{cite magazine |title=RePlay: The Players' Choice |magazine=RePlay |date=November 1985 |volume=11 |issue=2 |page=6 |url=https://archive.org/details/re-play-volume-11-issue-no.-2-november-1985-600DPI/RePlay%20-%20Volume%2011%2C%20Issue%20No.%202%20-%20November%201985%20%28Compressed%29/page/6}}</ref> In Europe, it had also become a very popular arcade game by 1986.<ref name=":7">{{Cite magazine|last=Edgeley|first=Clare|title=Arcade Action|magazine=Computer and Video Games|issue=63 (January 1987)|date=16 December 1986|publisher=[[EMAP]]|location=United Kingdom|issn=0261-3697|pages=138–9|url=https://archive.org/details/cvg-magazine-063/page/n137/mode/2up}}</ref>

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine gave the arcade version a generally positive review, calling it "a pleasant change" from the [[Shoot 'em up|space shooters]] popular in arcades at the time, but noted the gameplay is similar to [[Sega]]'s ''[[Bank Panic]]'' which released the same year and that it may not appeal to everyone.<ref name="CVG47"/> Mike Roberts and Eric Doyle of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' magazine gave the arcade game a positive review, praising the realistic gun controller.<ref name="CG8">{{cite magazine |last1=Roberts |first1=Mike |last2=Doyle |first2=Eric |title=Coin-Op Connection |magazine=[[Computer Gamer]] |date=November 1985 |issue=8 |pages=26–7 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_08_1985-11_Argus_Press_GB/page/n25/mode/2up}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' named ''Hogan's Alley'' as 1988's Best Target Game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, calling it "an entertaining variation on the theme".<ref name="cgw198811">{{cite magazine | title=Video Gaming World | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=53 | date=November 1988 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_53.pdf | accessdate=April 23, 2016 | last1=Kunkel | first1=Bill | last2=Worley | first2=Joyce | last3=Katz | first3=Arnie | pages=55}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Digital artist [[Cory Arcangel]] hacked the ''Hogan's Alley'' game to produce "I Shot [[Andy Warhol]]", an art piece that replaces the game's targets with images of Andy Warhol. This a reference to [[I Shot Andy Warhol| the film]] that dramatized [[Valerie Solanas]]'s attempted assassination of the artist.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Cory Arcangel |publisher=Guggenheim Museum and Langlois Foundation for Art, Science, and Technology |date=January 1, 2004 |work=Seeing Double: Emulation in Theory and Practice |url=http://variablemedia.net/e/seeingdouble/index.html |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}</ref>

''Hogan's Alley''-inspired games appear in ''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'' and other games in the ''WarioWare'' series. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]'', the ''[[Duck Hunt]]'' character has the ability to kick the can from the bonus rounds of ''Hogan's Alley'', which can be continually bounced forward by an off-screen shooter using the NES Zapper until it eventually explodes. The character's Final Smash attack causes opponents to get caught in the middle of a shootout between the enemies from ''Hogan's Alley'' and ''[[Wild Gunman]]''.
