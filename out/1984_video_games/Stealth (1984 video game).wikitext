'''''Stealth''''' is a [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] [[Shoot 'em up#Rail shooters|rail shooter]] designed by Tracy Lagrone and Richard Sansom. The game was published in 1984 by [[Broderbund]] for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and [[Commodore 64]].<ref name="giantlist"/>

The player's mission in ''Stealth'' is to pilot a low-level bomber-fighter ship to infiltrate enemy territory and travel a distance of 10,000 miles to reach and destroy the Black Tower (enemy citadel). The ship uses pulse energy for power, so the player must keep an eye on the fuel supply in addition to avoiding obstacles and shooting enemies. Energy fields are randomly scattered around the planet. The yellow ones contain fields of positive energy that can be used to refuel the player's ship. On the other hand, there are also red, negative energy fields that will drain the ship of energy. On the way to the Black Tower, the player has to watch out for enemy bunkers, tanks, rockets, reconnaissance planes and fighters. Additionally, the player must destroy the radar towers, because a failed attempt to destroy them automatically triggers the launch of a homing missile.

The game has five levels, and each successive level is much more difficult.

==Development==
An early version of the game was called ''Landscape''.<ref name="atarimania"/> ''Stealth'' uses excerpts of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s [[Harpsichord Concerto in D minor, BWV 1052|Harpsichord Concerto in D minor]] as its title music.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

==Reception==
The game has been met with positive-to-mixed reviews. Writing for ''[[Commodore Power/Play]]'', Tom Benford praised the game: "''Stealth'' is software par excellence. Everything, and I mean everything, about the game is positively top-notch: sound, color, graphics, breathtaking animation, play action, challenge level, continued interest—I'd really have to give it a "10" in all of these categories."<ref name="cpp">{{cite magazine|last=Benford|first=Tom|date=April–May 1985|title=Game Reviews: Stealth|url=https://archive.org/details/commodore-power-play-14/page/n25/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Commodore Power/Play]]|page=24}}</ref> ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]''{{'}}s Jack Powell called the game "a welcome fix for the shoot-'em'down arcade freaks who have been wondering where the next serious laser-zap would come from," praising its graphics for "creat[ing] an excellent sense of place and dimension."<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Powell|first=Jack|date=February 1985|title=Stealth|url=https://archive.org/details/1985-02-anticmagazine/page/n73/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]|volume=3|issue=10|page=75}}</ref> Gregg Keizer of ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' called it graphically "outstanding," stating: "It has one of the best 3-D views we've seen." They furthermore described the gameplay as "addicting", stating that "it's hard to tear yourself away from the screen" and calling it "one of the best [shoot-'em-up-arcade games] around."<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|date=April 1985|title=Stealth|url=https://archive.org/details/1985-04-computegazette/page/n79/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Compute!'s Gazette]]|volume=3|issue=4|page=78}}</ref>

Steve Panak was less positive in his review for ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' and stated: "It is a shame that a game with such nice graphics denies you equally fine playability. ''Stealth'' is fascinating the first time around, but you'll tire of it quickly."<ref name="analog">{{cite magazine|last=Panak|first=Steve|date=June 1985|title=Panak Strikes!: Stealth|url=https://archive.org/details/analog-computing-magazine-31/page/n67/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[ANALOG Computing]]|pages=67–68}}</ref> Likewise, ''[[Zzap!64]]'' gave the game an overall score of 56%, largely praising the graphics but criticizing the sound and lastability.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=November 1985|title=Stealth|url=https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-007/page/n15/mode/2up?view=theater|magazine=[[Zzap!64]]|issue=7|page=16|access-date=March 23, 2021}}</ref>
