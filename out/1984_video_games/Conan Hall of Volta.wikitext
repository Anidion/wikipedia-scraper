'''''Conan: Hall of Volta''''' (or simply '''''Conan''''' on the box cover and title screen) is a [[platform game]] from American developers Eric Robinson and Eric Parker and published by [[Datasoft]] in 1984.<ref name="moby">{{moby game|id=/9293/conan|name=''Conan: Hall of Volta''}}</ref>  It is based on the character [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] created by [[Robert E. Howard]]. This game was originally written for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[porting|ported]] to the [[Commodore 64]]<ref name=lemon/> and [[Atari 8-bit computers]].<ref name=mania/>

Released in 1984, the game's launch coincided with the debut of the film ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''. The box shows a painting of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as the muscle-bound warrior with his new costume for ''Destroyer''.  Despite this attempted tie-in, the game has little to do with the movie other than the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerian]] in the title role, having originally been designed as boomerang-throwing game titled ''Visigoth''. One of the screenshots on the back of the box is from a prototype version and shows a boomerang instead of a sword.<ref>[http://www.digitpress.com/eastereggs/appleconan.htm Digital Press Easter Eggs]</ref>

==Gameplay==
The player controls Conan as he attacks the evil Volta in his [[castle]] [[fortress]].  Conan is armed with 10 [[boomerang]] [[sword]]s.  From time to time, Conan may be aided by an "Avian Ally" as he attempts to defeat Volta's sinister hordes, which included [[bat]]s, [[scorpion]]s, giant [[ant]]s, fire-breathing [[dragon]]s and floating eyeballs.

The game includes seven diverse levels requiring the player to navigate [[lava]] pits, [[geyser]]s, spike pits, and floating platforms.  Along the way the player often needs to collect magic gems or keys in order to progress.

In the game, Conan does not jump, he [[somersault]]s. If he falls, he launches into a [[Diving (sport)|dive]].

One original feature of the game's time was a close-up picture that would be shown upon the player's last death. For example, dying in the first level might show a close-up picture of a bat with the caption "bats in your belfry". Deaths in other levels would yield a picture of a hazard unique to that level:

*Bats in your belfry
*Only a cleric can help you now
*Quest terminated (spike pit)
*There is no glory for you here
*To be continued
*A watery barrier
*You shuffle off defeated for now
