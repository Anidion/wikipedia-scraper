{{nihongo foot|'''''The Tower of Druaga'''''|ドルアーガの塔|''Doruāga no Tō''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1984 [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[action role-playing]] [[maze game]] developed and published in Japan by [[Namco]]. Controlling the golden-armored knight Gilgamesh, the player is tasked with scaling 60 floors of the titular tower in an effort to rescue the maiden Ki from Druaga, a demon with eight arms and four legs, who plans to use an artifact known as the Blue Crystal Rod to enslave all of mankind. It ran on the [[Namco Super Pac-Man]] arcade hardware, modified with a horizontal-scrolling video system used in ''[[Mappy]]''.

''Druaga'' was designed by [[Masanobu Endo]], best known for creating ''[[Xevious]]'' (1983). It was conceived as a "fantasy ''[[Pac-Man]]''" with combat and puzzle solving, taking inspiration from games such as ''[[Wizardry]]'' and ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', along with [[Mesopotamian myths|Mesopotamian]], [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] and [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian mythology]]. It began as a prototype game called ''Quest'' with interlocking mazes, revised to run on an arcade system; the original concept was scrapped due to Endo disliking the heavy use of role-playing elements, instead becoming a more action-oriented game.

In Japan, ''The Tower of Druaga'' was widely successful, attracting millions of fans for its use of secrets and hidden items. It is cited as an important game of its genre for laying down the foundation for future games, as well as inspiring the idea of sharing tips with friends and guidebooks. ''Druaga'' is noted as being influential for many games to follow, including ''[[Ys (series)|Ys]]'', ''[[Hydlide]]'', ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''. The success of the game in Japan inspired several ports for multiple platforms, as well as spawning a massive franchise known as the ''[[Babylonian Castle Saga]]'', including multiple sequels, spin-offs, literature and an [[The Tower of Druaga (TV series)|anime series]] produced by [[Gonzo (studio)|Gonzo]]. However, the 2009 [[Wii Virtual Console]] release in North America was met with a largely negative reception for its obtuse design, which many said was near-impossible to finish without a guidebook, alongside its high difficulty and controls. 

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC The Tower of Druaga.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]
''The Tower of Druaga'' is an action role-playing maze video game. Controlling the knight Gilgamesh, the player must scale all 60 floors of the tower to rescue the maiden Ki from Druaga, an eight-armed and four-legged demon who plans to use an artifact called the Blue Crystal Rod to enslave mankind.<ref name="Guidebook"/> Gilgamesh will need to locate a key on each floor in order to open a door, allowing him to proceed to the next floor.<ref name="Guidebook">{{cite book |title=The Tower of Druaga PC-Engine Guidebook |date=1992 |publisher=Fighting Studio |language=ja}}</ref>

Each floor contains enemies that Gilgamesh may need to defeat to progress, such as slimes, knights, projectile-firing wizards, ghosts that can travel through walls and fire-spewing dragons.<ref name="Guidebook"/> Gilgamesh can defeat these enemies by hitting them with a sword — some will require multiple hits to defeat.<ref name="Guidebook"/> Gilgamesh can also block a projectile by facing it with his shield.<ref name="Guidebook"/> Each floor also has a hidden item that can be uncovered by completing tasks, such as defeating a certain number of enemies or inputting a specific code with the joystick.<ref name="Guidebook"/> These items include a pickaxe that can destroy walls, boots that will drastically increase Gilgamesh's walking speed, and a candle that can reveal ghosts.<ref name="Guidebook"/><ref name="Game Developer"/> Some of these items are required to fully beat the game, and failing to do so will either cause the player to die or make the game unwinnable.<ref name="Guidebook"/>

A time limit is also present on each floor, and should the player take too long, two indestructible spherical enemies named "Will-o-Wisps" will charge towards Gilgamesh.<ref name="Guidebook"/> Should the player forget to get a required item, they will instead be sent back, or "zapped", to an earlier floor to retrieve it.<ref name="Guidebook"/> The game's mazes are randomized in each playthrough, although the treasure will appear at the player's starting point.<ref name="Guidebook"/>

==Development and release==
''The Tower of Druaga'' was designed by [[Masanobu Endo]], who had joined [[Namco]] in April 1982.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://hg101.kontek.net/xevious/xevious.htm | title=''Xevious'' | author=Savorelli, Carlo | work=Hardcore Gaming 101 | access-date=2022-11-04}}</ref> After releasing ''[[Xevious]]'' a year later, an overwhelming success in Japan, Endo took a business trip to North America, where he bought a copy of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.<ref name="GSLA"/> Intrigued by its gameplay and setting, Endo — a fan of the [[Apple II]] game ''[[Wizardry]]'' — had set out to make his next game an action role-playing title.<ref name="GSLA"/> After returning to Japan, he designed a basic prototype game called ''Quest'', where the player would be able to explore inter-locking rooms while defeating enemies and using keys to open doors — an expanded version was then made to run on the [[Namco Super Pac-Man]] arcade system, where it was titled ''The Return of Ishtar''.<ref name="GAME Watch Interview">{{cite web |last1=Katsuo |first1=Ishida |title=立命館大学、「ドルアーガの塔」のセミナーを実施 遠藤氏が企画初期の流れを披露。ゴンゾ橋本氏はアニメの狙いを語る |url=https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20080512/dru.htm |website=GAME Watch |publisher=Impress Group |access-date=3 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626135856/https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20080512/dru.htm |archive-date=26 June 2018 |date=13 May 2008}}</ref> Upon completion, Endo was dissatisfied with the game's heavy use of role-playing elements, leading to the game instead becoming an action-oriented game with puzzle solving,<ref name="GSLA">{{cite web |title=Xevious Interview |url=http://shmuplations.com/xevious/ |website=GSLA |access-date=1 January 2003}}</ref> conceived as a "fantasy ''[[Pac-Man]]''".<ref name="Game Developer">{{cite web |last1=Pepe |first1=Filepe |title=1982-1987 - The Birth of Japanese RPGs, re-told in 15 Games |url=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/1982-1987---the-birth-of-japanese-rpgs-re-told-in-15-games |website=[[Game Developer (website)|Game Developer]] |date=10 October 2016 |access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref>

For the second prototype, Endo took inspiration from [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]], [[Mesopotamian myths|Mesopotamian]] and [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian mythology]], including ''[[The Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' and [[The Tower of Babel]].<ref name="GAME Watch Interview"/> Several characters were named after Mesopotamian and Indian gods, including antagonist Druaga and the goddess Ishtar.<ref name="GAME Watch Interview"/>  The game was made to run on the same hardware setup used in ''[[Mappy]]'', which featured horizontal-scrolling and had a vertical screen layout,<ref name="GSLA"/> while the 60 floors were inspired by the [[Sunshine 60]], the tallest building in Asia at the time. Music for the game was composed by Junko Ozawa, who also created a unique sound driver for the music. The promotional arcade flyer used miniature dioramas with cardboard cutouts instead of drawings, a response to Namco president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]]'s hatred towards [[manga]].<ref name="GAME Watch Interview"/> The last frame in the poster has Gilgamesh wearing the horned helmet fighting Druaga, meant to imply that players would need it in order to finish the game.<ref name="GAME Watch Interview"/> ''The Tower of Druaga'' was released for arcades in Japan in June 1984.<ref name="All About Namco">{{cite book |author1=Microcomputer BASIC Editorial Department |title=All About Namco |date=December 1986 |publisher=Dempa Shimbun |isbn=978-4885541070 |language=ja}}</ref>

The Wii Virtual Console release in 2009 was met with a largely negative reception in North America, many criticizing the game's controls, high difficulty and design. Reviewing the Wii Virtual Console port, Dan Whitehead of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' referred to the game's design as "diabolically obtuse" and criticized Gilgamesh's slow movement, notably with deflecting projectiles.<ref name="Eurogamer"/> Whitehead also criticized its hidden treasures for being too elusive and for only appealing towards dedicated players, although stated it was an interesting gameplay idea.<ref name="Eurogamer"/> Brett Alan Weiss of ''[[Allgame]]'' also criticized its hidden items, especially those required for later levels, as well as the player's "wimpy" attack and time limit.<ref name="Allgame"/> Lucas M.
