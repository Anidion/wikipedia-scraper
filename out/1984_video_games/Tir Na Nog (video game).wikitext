'''''Tir Na Nog''''' is a [[video game]] that was published in 1984 by [[Gargoyle Games]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. A [[Commodore 64]] version was released in 1985. It is loosely based on [[Celtic mythology]]. ''Tir Na Nog'' was positively reviewed by critics. A prequel - ''[[Dun Darach]]'' - was published a year later.

==Plot==
[[Tir Na nÓg]], [[Irish language|Irish]] for "Land of Youth", is the location for the game. The protagonist, [[Cú_Chulainn|Cuchulainn]], has departed the land of the living and finds himself at an altar in this land, essentially an afterlife. His goal is to reunite the four fragments of the Seal of Calum and place it on the altar, all while avoiding the [[sídhe]].

==Gameplay==

Gameplay takes the form of an arcade-adventure with the player controlling the hero as he wanders the land of Tir Na Nog collecting objects, solving puzzles and trying to keep out of the way of the sídhe who also wander the land. Many of the puzzles that Cuchulainn is set are cryptic in nature (e.g. "The backdoor key is me") rather than straightforward and may rely on some [[lateral thinking]].

Because he is in an afterlife, Cuchulainn cannot die and if he is "defeated" by a sídhe he is simply transported elsewhere and loses all his carried objects.

The Land of Tir Na Nog is large and consists of [[plain]]s, [[caverns]] and [[forests]]. Cuchulainn can move north, south, east and west with the player "rotating" the view using the keyboard and then having Cuchulainn move left or right on the screen. The player can collect any objects they come across with Cuchulainn being able to carry several at one time. Some of these objects can be used as weapons: the game allows the player to "thrust" with any item.
