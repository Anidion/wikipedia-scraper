{{nihongo foot|'''''The Death Trap'''''|ザ・デストラップ|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is a [[interactive fiction|text adventure]] developed and published by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[NEC PC-8801]], [[PC-9801|NEC PC-9801]], and [[Fujitsu FM-7]] in 1984. The game and its supporting computer platforms were only released in [[Japan]]. ''The Death Trap'' is the first game developed by Square, created before they were even an independent company. At the time, Square was a software branch of Den-Yu-Sha, a Japanese power line manufacturing firm; it was not until 1986 that [[Square (video game company)|Square]] was independently established.

Square released a sequel in 1985 called ''Will: The Death Trap II''. Square's third and final text adventure game was called ''[[Alpha (video game)|Alpha]]'', released in 1986, and tells a [[science fiction]] story in the same style as ''The Death Trap''.

==Gameplay==
''The Death Trap'' is a silent (no sound) text parser adventure game, which relies on simple command lines from the user's input to progress through the game.<ref name=first/> As opposed to most "text adventures", with only text as output, ''The Death Trap'' provides graphical feedback using full screen still images.<ref name=usgamer/>

==Plot==
The game's plot revolves around a spy in an African country during a civil war.<ref name=war>{{cite web|url=http://shmuplations.com/historyofsquare/|accessdate=June 3, 2020|title=The History of Square – 1992 Developer Interview|publisher=Dengeki SFC magazine|date=January 1, 1992}}{{dead link|date=August 2023}}</ref> The story also involves biological warfare.<ref name=jaffe>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/first-games-legendary-developers/|publisher=GamesRadar|accessdate=June 3, 2020|date=March 19, 2014|title=Before Jaffe, Miyamoto, and Inafune hit it big, they made...|author=Sullivan, Lucas}}</ref>

The game's plot is set during the 1980s. In the game, the Cold War has become tense, and many countries have begun to prepare for a global-scale war, working on new weapons. One of such countries is the mysterious "B country" in Eastern Africa, which in an attempt to create biological weapons kidnaps the famous scientist Dr. Gitanes. An agent named Benson is sent to B country in order to rescue the doctor and avert the new threat to world peace.

==Development==
''The Death Trap'' was the first game developed by Square, a computer game software branch of Den-Yū-Sha Electric Company. [[Masashi Miyamoto]], who founded Square in September 1983, believed that it would be more efficient to have graphic designers, programmers and writers work together on common projects. Upon Square's inception, Miyamoto initially hired as their first developers university students [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] and [[Hiromichi Tanaka]], and a few others.<ref name="paper"/> They shortly began work on Square's first game, ''The Death Trap''. Sakaguchi noted in 1985 that he had expected to only do clerical work, not develop video games, yet was appointed a producer for the game.<ref>{{cite journal |title=12 Developers, 20 Questions – 1985 Interview Special |journal=BEEP! |date=October 1985 |url=http://shmuplations.com/20questions1985/ |accessdate=2015-01-19}}</ref><ref name=jaffe/> Sakaguchi was also a scenario writer for ''The Death Trap'' even though he too was a part time employee who had just left university.<ref name=book>{{cite book|title=Business Development, Merger and Crisis Management of International Firms in Japan|chapter=4|page=56|author= Parissa, Haghirian|publisher=World Scientific|date=January 1, 2018}}</ref> [[Harunobu Kato]] and Tanaka served as programmers. Other scenario writers were 雪ノ浦美樹, 林明弘 and 鈴木尚志. The graphics team consisted of [[Hiromi Nakada]], 雪ノ浦美樹, 今泉美保 and 斉藤智子.

==Reception==
''The Death Trap'' received little attention at the time of release, though it was successful enough for Square to immediately go on to create a sequel: ''Will: The Death Trap II''. Hironobu Sakaguchi, Hiromichi Tanaka, Harunobu Kato and Hiromi Nakada continued developing games for Square, while the rest of those credited left.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retropc.net/fm-7/museum/database/staff/220100200.html|title=Oh!FM-7：スタッフリスト／ウィル|last=Laver|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retropc.net/fm-7/museum/database/staff/220100300.html|title=Oh!FM-7：スタッフリスト／アルファ|last=Laver|publisher=}}</ref>
