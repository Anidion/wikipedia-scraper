'''''The Evil Dead''''' is an [[adventure game]] produced by [[Palace Software]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[ZX Spectrum]]. Based on [[The Evil Dead|the 1981 horror film of the same name]], it was the first officially licensed ''Evil Dead'' video game. The ZX Spectrum version was never released on its own and eventually appeared on the B-side of ''[[Cauldron (video game)|Cauldron]]''.<ref name="retro"/>

The game is set in the cabin from the ''Evil Dead'' film. The player controls [[Ash Williams|Ash]], and must close cabin windows to prevent monsters from entering, while also killing monsters that are already in the cabin.

As the player defeats [[monster]]s with various weapons (shovels, shotguns, and axes), Ash's energy level decreases. Ash must continuously pick up new weapons in order to increase his energy. Once he has defeated all the monsters, Ash must obtain ''[[Necronomicon|The Book of the Dead]]'' and destroy it in order to defeat the evil.

==Reception==
===Contemporary opinion and "computer nasties" controversy===
[[Your Computer (British magazine)|''Your Computer'' magazine]]'s 1984 review noted then-contemporary concerns that gaming spin-offs of "[[video nasty|video nasties]]" (such as The Evil Dead) might spawn similarly explicit "computer nasties". However, it considered that the game itself allayed any such fears, saying "you might have wondered if home computer graphics were capable of the sort of gory special effects video nasties trade in. The Evil Dead would confirm your doubts [..] there is nothing here to keep even the most unworldly 12-year-old awake at night".<ref name='yc43'>{{cite journal|url=ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/magazines/YourComputer/Issue8409/Pages/YourComputer840900043.jpg|journal=Your Computer|title=Software Shortlist (''The Evil Dead'')|page=43|date=September 1984}}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Despite this, and the game's similarities to ''[[Atic Atac]]'' being noted, the review was generally positive, considering the graphics "excellent" and stating that there was "enough variety in it to keep the interest alive".<ref name='yc45'>{{cite journal|url=ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/magazines/YourComputer/Issue8409/Pages/YourComputer840900043.jpg|journal=Your Computer|title=Software Shortlist (''The Evil Dead'')|page=45|date=September 1984|quote="the game turns out to be a distant relation of Atic Atac. [..] The Evil Dead sports some excellent graphics [..] there is enough variety in it to keep the interest alive for a good few playing hours.}}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Retrospective===
In a 2004 retrospective, ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' stated that while the game was simplistic by current standards, it was "fun to play (for about five minutes anyway)".<ref name="retro">{{cite journal |title=Horror Movie Licenses |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |author=Staff |page=71 |issue=1 |date=January 2004}}</ref>
