{{nihongo|'''''Great Swordsman'''''|グレートソードマン}} is an [[arcade video game|arcade]] [[fighting game]] developed by [[Allumer]] and published by [[Taito]] in [[1984 in video gaming|1984]]. In [[2005 in video gaming|2005]], it was later included in ''[[Taito Legends]]''.

==Gameplay==
In ''Great Swordsman'', one or two players can play while taking turns. Players control with two-way joystick and three buttons with different hit levels.  Each for creating different level attacks. Like in [[Data East]]'s [[Karate Champ]], buttons must be held. If they are released, the players' characters will revert to their standing animation. Moves can be defended against by intercepting the players' opponents' weapons with the players'.

The object of the game is to land a hit on the opponent or push him/her off the mat to score a point. There are fifteen levels with three different modes.  The first three are [[fencing]], the next five are [[kendo]], and the final seven are [[gladiator]]-based. After clearing all levels in one mode, the "VICTORY SCORE" will be added to the players' scores, even if any of them was tied with their opponents at the end. After fifteen levels are completed, the players start over in a higher difficulty setting and repeat after the next fifteen levels are also cleared.  There are also bonus levels where players must deflect arrows to score extra points.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Great Swordsman'' on their September 1, 1984 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref name="GM243">{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=243|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 September 1984|page=29|lang=ja}}</ref>
