== Reception == 
In a ''[[GameSpy]]'' interview, Shadowkeep was called "a groundbreaking product at the time", "which paved the way for more complex products like ''[[Eye of the Beholder (video game)|Eye of the Beholder]]'' and its peers".<ref name=":0">[http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/interviews/afoster_a.shtm David Cuciz: GameSpy Interviews â€“ Alan Dean Foster.

== Software ==
''Shadowkeep'' was released for [[Apple II series|Apple II]] computers and was written in Ultra II.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Shadowkeep for Apple II (1984)|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/shadowkeep|website=MobyGames|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref> The game was stored on 4 [[floppy disk]]s. Progress in the game would be saved directly to the game disk, without the ability to return to the default state, so players were advised to first copy the game onto 4 blank disks so the game could be played from the start again. Players could also save progress in the game to a fifth disk, which could be used to restore progress in the game in conjunction of the 4 modified disks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Computer Game Museum Display Case - Shadowkeep|url=https://mocagh.org/loadpage.php?getgame=shadowkeep|website=mocagh.org|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref>
