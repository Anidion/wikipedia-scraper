'''''Firefox''''' is a 1984 [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade video game]] based on the 1982 [[Clint Eastwood]] [[Firefox (film)|movie of the same name]].<ref>[http://www.atarigames.com/firefoxart1.jpg "Firefox Takes Off"] from Atari employee newsletter (page 1)</ref>  It was produced in 1984<ref name="vaxmail">[http://www.jmargolin.com/vmail/Vax84.txt Atari Vax emails] "And to my knowledge, Coin-op has yet to sacrifice quality to get an on-time delivery. Firefox was supposed to start production 1/23/84; millions in parts are all staged ready for production, but it has not started (1/31/84) because the software is not ready."</ref><ref name="manual">{{citation |url=http://arcarc.xmission.com/PDF_LaserDisc_Games/Firefox%20SP-253%202nd%20Printing.pdf |title=Schematic Package Supplement to '''Firefox''' Operators Manual |publisher=Atari}}</ref> as [[Atari, Inc.]]'s only [[LaserDisc video game]]. Like Atari's first-person ''[[Star Wars (1983 video game)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (arcade game)|Empire Strikes Back]]'', ''Firefox'' came as both an upright and sit down cabinet with a [[yoke (aircraft)|yoke]] style controller.

==Development==

Firefox was primarily designed by Mike Hally and Dave Ralston, and programmed by Greg Rivera and Norm Avellar. 

The cabinet featured stereo sound with an additional headphone port and volume control in the front. All Firefox cabinets shipped with a 19" Amplifone [[Raster graphics|raster]] monitor, and utilized an Atari quad-[[POKEY]]. Firefox's power requirements necessitated the use of two Atari AR-II power supplies.

To collect the LaserDisc video, developers Mike Hally and Moe Shore sifted through 20 to 30 hours' worth of footage shot for the film. Most of the resulting footage was first-person shots filmed from helicopters flying over [[Greenland]] and [[Scandinavia]].<ref>[http://www.atarigames.com/firefoxart2.jpg "Firefox Takes Off"] from Atari employee newsletter (page 2)</ref>

Firefox shares a cabinet with [[I, Robot (video game)|I, Robot]], although significantly fewer ''I, Robot'' machines were produced.

==Reception==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Firefox'' on their April 1, 1984 issue as being the third most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=233|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 April 1984|page=27|lang=ja}}</ref> In the United States, it was the top-grossing laserdisc game on the ''[[Play Meter]]'' arcade charts in July 1984.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=National Play Meter |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=August 15, 1984}}</ref>
