'''''The Biz''''' is a management simulation game published by [[Virgin Group|Virgin Games]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984. In ''The Biz'', the player manages a [[rock music|rock]] band. The price of the game on release was £6.95, which is equivalent to £{{Format price |{{Inflation|UK|6.95|1984|r=2}}}} today. The tape cassette contained the program, an interview with [[Frank Sidebottom]] and [[Chris Sievey]], and eight singles.<ref name="crashreview"/>

== Gameplay ==

Players set up their rock band with gigs, make them [[rehearsal|rehearse]] new [[song]]s, and hire a [[recording studio]] for producing new [[album]]s. The player starts out with no talent or [[pound sterling|money]] and an [[talent agent|agent]] must be hired in order to better co-ordinate the band. The stage presence of the band and the [[fandom|fanbase]] are improved with every gig performed. School [[Dance party|dance]]s and [[YMCA]]s are the first places that accept the player's newly formed band. Real television stations are included: a band from either [[Swansea]] or [[Cardiff]] would perform on [[S4C]] while a local band from [[Coventry]] would get promoted on [[Central Independent Television|Central Television]]. Players can sometimes record a [[List of Peel sessions|session]] with [[John Peel]], whose broadcasting influence opened up new bands to people between the ages of 20 and 60.

Mundane details such as [[insurance]], standard [[musical instrument]]s and transportation [[expense]]s are all tabulated against the player's savings in the game. The game also contains an anti-[[drug]] message for bands who consider experimenting with them.

== Reviews ==

The game only contains sound effects and no music, although eight singles were included on the cassette.  There are no graphics to speak of and the game is [[text-based game|text-based]].  A ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' review in March 1985 praised the game, stating that it was ''"[a]n unusually absorbing and addictive strategy/simulation with a sense of humour that represents good value."''<ref name="crashreview">{{cite magazine |date=March 1985 |title=The Biz |url=https://archive.org/details/crash-magazine-14/page/n19/mode/2up |magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |location=United Kingdom |publisher=[[Newsfield Publications Ltd]] |access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref>
