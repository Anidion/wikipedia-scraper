(comic)|B.C.]]'', the newspaper [[comic strip]] by [[Johnny Hart]]. The game was advertised for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[Amstrad CPC]], but those ports were never released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0013921|title=B.C.

==Plot==
Thor, a [[caveman]], who rides a [[Rock (geology)|stone]] [[unicycle]], is searching for the "[[meaning of life]]" within several mountains.

==Gameplay==
The player must navigate Thor through the mountains, collecting [[clam]]s. As in the comic strip, clams are used as money. The object of the game is to collect enough clams to pay a toll to another caveman, Peter, which will allow Thor to access the next mountain.

The player moves Thor along the mountainside and through caves. When on the mountainside, Thor can move in all four directions, but must avoid falling off the cliff, slamming into a wall, or hitting a rock or hole. When in a cave, the screen is dark except for a beam of light emanating from the player's position. Here, Thor may move from side to side, avoiding stalagmites.

There are two enemies that Thor must avoid: One is the 'Tiredactyl' which will chase after Thor, in hopes of consuming Thor's tire (and causing him to lose a life). The other is Grog; if he and Thor are on the same level, an alarm melody will play. If Grog catches up to or meets Thor, he will shout "GROG", launching Thor skyward and ending the game.

If the player collects enough clams before arriving at the end of the mountain trail, he proceeds to the next mountain; otherwise, he must go back and collect more clams.<ref name="Compute Gazette">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/details/1985-09-computegazette | title= B.C.

==Ports==
The [[Commodore 64]] and [[Coleco Adam|Coleco ADAM]] versions has 15 stages (5 per set). The [[MSX]] and [[ColecoVision]] versions only has 5 stages.
