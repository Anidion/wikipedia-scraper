'''''I, Robot''''' is an [[arcade shooter]] game developed and released in 1984 by [[Atari, Inc. (1972–1992)|Atari, Inc.]]<ref name="Copyright"/><ref name="atari_production"/> Designed by [[Dave Theurer]], only a total of 750–1000 [[arcade cabinet]]s were produced.<ref name="atari_production">{{cite web|title=Atari Production Numbers Memo|url=http://www.atarigames.com/pdffiles/productionnumbers.pdf|publisher=[[Atari Games]]|access-date=18 March 2012|date=4 January 2010|archive-date=25 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925150926/http://www.atarigames.com/pdffiles/productionnumbers.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="atari_production99">{{cite web|title=Production Numbers|url=http://www.atarigames.com/atarinumbers90s.pdf|publisher=[[Atari]]|access-date=19 March 2012|year=1999|archive-date=10 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510143012/http://www.atarigames.com/atarinumbers90s.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> The arcade machine comes with two games. The first is ''I, Robot'', a [[Shoot 'em up#multidirectional shooter|multi-directional shooter]] that has the player assume the role of "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984", a servant bot that rebels against [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]. The object of the game involves the servant bot going through 126 levels, turning red squares to blue to destroy Big Brother's shield and eye. The player can switch to the second game, ''Doodle City'', a drawing tool that lasts for three minutes.

''I, Robot'' was the first commercially produced arcade video game rendered entirely with [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]], [[Flat shading|flat-shaded]], [[3D computer graphics|3D polygon]] [[graphics]]. Previous real-time 3D graphics were [[Vector graphics|vector]] lines instead of [[Rasterisation|rasterized]] polygons, one example being Atari's ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]'' (1981) a "[[Shoot 'em up|tube shooter]]" which Dave Theurer had also designed and programmed.<ref name="IGN robot" /> While [[Funai]]'s [[laserdisc game]] ''Interstellar'' (1983) had previously used [[pre-rendered]] [[3D computer graphics]]<ref name="GM226">{{cite magazine|title=立体CGを駆使したVDゲーム 〜 未来の宇宙戦争 〜 フナイから 『インターステラー』|trans-title=VD Game That Makes Full Use of 3D CG – Future Space War: "Interstellar" from Funai|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|issue=226|date=15 December 1983|page=24|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19831215p.pdf#page=13}}</ref> and Simutrek's ''[[Cube Quest]]'' (1983) had used real-time 3D graphics combined with laserdisc [[full-motion video]] backgrounds,<ref>{{cite web |title=Video Game Flyers: Cube Quest, Simutrek |url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=260 |website=The Arcade Flyer Archive |access-date=22 May 2021}}</ref>  ''I, Robot'' was the first arcade game to be rendered entirely with 3D polygon graphics at runtime.<ref name="Phoenix"/> It was also the first video game to feature camera-control options.

Upon release of the game, ''I, Robot'' received poor reception and was a financial flop.<ref>(October 6, 2010).

''I, Robot'' and ''[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (video game)|Return of the Jedi]]'' were the last two arcade games released from Atari, Inc. Shortly afterward, the company was split up, with the home console and personal computer divisions sold to [[Jack Tramiel]] and renamed [[Atari Corporation]]. The arcade coin-op division was retained by [[Warner Communications]] and renamed [[Atari Games]]. ''[[Marble Madness]]'' was the first arcade coin-op game released under the new Atari Games banner.

In 2022, the game was included as part of the ''[[Atari 50]]'' compilation, marking its first re-release.<ref>{{cite web|last=Machkovech|first=Sam|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/the-103-classic-games-that-did-and-didnt-make-the-atari-50-anniversary-cut/|title=The 103 classic games that did, and didn't, make the Atari 50 anniversary cut — Retailer leak suggests games from arcade to Jaguar; surprises apparently still await|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=September 12, 2022|access-date=2023-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220914101824/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/the-103-classic-games-that-did-and-didnt-make-the-atari-50-anniversary-cut/|archive-date=2022-09-14|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:I, Robot (arcade game).png|200 px|thumb|left|Gameplay of "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984" walking on squares to change them from red to blue to destroy Big Brother's shield and its eye]]
In ''I, Robot'', the player controls "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984", a servant [[robot]] that has become [[self-awareness|self-aware]] and decides to rebel against Big Brother.<ref name="IGN robot">{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Levi|date=2008-08-28|title=The Revolution of I, Robot|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/08/28/the-revolution-of-i-robot?amp=1|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217164734/http://retro.ign.com/articles/906/906161p1.html|archive-date=February 17, 2012|access-date=2009-08-21|website=IGN.com}}</ref>  To advance from level to level, the robot must destroy the giant blinking eye of Big Brother, first by wearing down its shield and then attacking the eye directly.  The robot fires energy at the shield by moving over red blocks in the level, converting them to blue.

Although the robot can jump, the robot will be destroyed if jumping while the eye is open.<ref name="IGN robot"/>  Various extra hazards, such as birds, bombs and flying sharks, can also destroy the robot during each level.  At the end of some levels, rather than destroying the eye immediately, the robot must navigate a maze and collect gems before it encounters the eye at close range.  Once a level is completed, the robot flies through outer space and must shoot or avoid "[[tetrahedron|tetras]]", meteors, and various obstacles (including a floating head that fires nails) to reach the next level.

The player can adjust the camera angle during gameplay, moving closer to the robot or flying up for an overhead view of the level.  The closer the camera is to the robot, the greater the score multiplier, but the more difficult it is to see the whole level and Big Brother.  In later levels, enemies known as "viewer killers" begin attacking the camera directly, forcing the player to either change the viewing angle or move the robot so that the camera will follow it.  Failing to avoid a viewer killer costs the player a life.

There are 26 unique level designs; after completing all of them, the levels repeat at a higher difficulty and with a different color palette, as in Atari's earlier game ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]''.  After completing a total of 126 levels, the player is thrown back to a random earlier level.<ref name="history">{{Cite web|title=I, Robot, Arcade Video game by Atari, Inc.|url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=i,-robot&page=detail&id=1167|access-date=2020-07-01|website=www.arcade-history.com}}</ref> The game ends when the player runs out of lives.

===Doodle City===
''Doodle City'', referred to in the game as an [[non-game|ungame]], is a simple drawing tool which presents the player with a selection of objects from the "game" mode. It was in some ways, an experiment in 3D art. The player can move and rotate each shape and can cause trails to be left on the screen as they are moved.  The player can remain in this mode for up to three minutes per credit, and can switch back to the main game at any time.  One life is subtracted from the player's life pool for each minute spent in ''Doodle City''.<ref name="IGN robot"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=I, Robot (Game)|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/i-robot/3030-21973/|access-date=2021-06-28|website=Giant Bomb|language=en}}</ref>

==Development==
The game features amplified [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] and [[Raster graphics|pixel graphics]] on a 19-inch color [[Cathode ray tube|CRT monitor]]. It uses a [[Motorola 6809]] [[central processing unit]] and four Atari [[POKEY]] audio chips.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web| url = http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8172| title = I, Robot – Videogame by Atari | publisher = [[Killer List of Videogames]]| access-date = 2009-08-19}}</ref> ''I, Robot'' was originally called "''Ice Castles''".<ref name="KLOV"/>

Dave Sherman developed the custom bit-slice ('pepperoni') 3D co-processor that allowed for a throughput of approximately 2,000 polygons per second. It includes four [[AMD Am2900|AMD 2901]] 4-bit slice programmable ALU chips.<ref>{{cite web |title= I-Robot Tech Page |author= Dan Boris |url= https://atarihq.com/danb/irobot.shtml}}</ref>

''I, Robot'''s cabinet was identical to the ''[[Firefox (video game)|Firefox]]'' [[laserdisc game]] upright cabinet.<ref name="KLOV"/> The cabinet was furnished with an [[Atari]] patented [[Hall effect|Hall-effect]] joystick, two fire buttons and two buttons to control the players viewing angle.<ref name="KLOV"/>

The gameplay borrowed features from earlier arcade games such as ''[[Galaga]]'' (1981) and ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980).<ref name="Phoenix">{{cite book |last1=Herman |first1=Leonard |chapter=1984 |title=Phoenix: The Fall & Rise of Videogames |title-link=Phoenix: The Fall & Rise of Videogames |date=1997 |publisher=Rolenta Press |isbn=978-0-9643848-2-8 |page=111 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=duITAQAAIAAJ |quote=''I, Robot'' was the first game that featured state-of-the-art 3D polygon graphics, a technique that was nearly ten years ahead of its time. This bizarre game which borrowed features from earlier arcade games like ''Galaga'' and ''Pac-Man'' even had an option where players could doodle their own abstract polygon generated ''art''.}}</ref> The game's release was delayed due to technical issues and difficulties, so it was returned to the lab for further testing and research, and was not fully released until June 1984.<ref>{{Cite web|title=CUBE QUEST (Simutrek 1984)|url=http://www.erasurewars.net/lostarcadeclassics/43-%20CUBE%20QUEST.html|access-date=2020-07-01|website=www.erasurewars.net}}</ref>

==Reception==

''I, Robot'' received a poor reception on release. Approximately 750–1000 units of the game were created. Few have been confirmed to exist today.<ref name="ROR"/> The arcade cabinets have since become rare collectibles with Dave Theurer's involvement being a selling point among collectors.<ref name="PriceGuide-1">{{cite book| title = Official Price Guide to Classic Video Games| first = David| last = Ellis| page = [https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/383 383]| chapter = Arcade Classics| publisher = [[Random House]]| isbn = 0-375-72038-3| year = 2004| chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/383}}</ref><ref name="PriceGuide-2">{{cite book| title = Official Price Guide to Classic Video Games| first = David| last = Ellis| page = [https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/354 354]| chapter = Arcade Classics| publisher = [[Random House]]| isbn = 0-375-72038-3| year = 2004| chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/officialpricegui00davi/page/354}}</ref>

The arcade game received mixed reviews upon release. ''[[Play Meter]]'' published two reviews in its December 1984 issue. Gene Lewin rated the dedicated arcade cabinet 2 out of 10, but raised it to 7 if released as a conversion kit. The review praised the "unusual" colorful graphics and originality, but said "it lacks the excitement necessary to make it a top earning game" and that an "average player will not be very interested in ''I, Robot''." Roger C. Sharpe rated it three [[Number sign|hashes]], with praise for the "new 3-D raster video animation system" and execution, stating it "won't be a sure-fire sensation, but it does exhibit "sleeper" qualities."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Lewin |first1=Gene |last2=Sharpe |first2=Roger C. |title=Gene's Gudgements / Critic's Corner |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=December 1, 1984 |volume=10 |issue=22 |pages=81–7 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-10-number-22-december-1st-1984/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%2010%2C%20Number%2022%20-%20December%201st%201984/page/81}}</ref> Clare Edgeley of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine reviewed the game in March 1985, stating that the "graphics are perhaps the most unusual of any arcade game around" but is nevertheless "a [[Rubik's Cube|cubist]]'s delight." She also said the ability to change angles is a "nice" touch.<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|title=Arcade Action|last=Edgeley|first=Clare|issue=42 (April 1985)|date=16 March 1985|pages=92–93|url=https://archive.org/details/computer-video-games-magazine-042/page/n91}}</ref> In 1991, ''[[Mean Machines]]'' placed it on its wishlist for arcade games to appear on consoles, believing the [[Super Famicom]] would do that game justice.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Mean Machines]]|title=Yob's Gossip|page=97|issue=7|date=April 1991|url=https://archive.org/details/Mean_Machines_Issue_07_1991-04_EMAP_Images_GB/page/n95}}</ref> In 2001, author John Sellers described ''I, Robot'' as a "near miss" because of its strong release that didn't gain enough popularity.

A rumor persisted that Atari shipped 500 unsold units to Japan with instructions to dump the units into the ocean at the halfway point.<ref name="GWR09"/> Atari employee Rusty Dawe dispelled this rumor as a "total myth" in a 2009 interview, adding "I would have LIKED to dump [the] ''I, Robot'' controls into the ocean [as they were a] total nightmare. But that didn't happen either."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rotheblog.com/2009/06/arcade/transcript-from-rusty-dawe-chat-at-coinopspace-com/|title=Interview with Rusty Dawe}}</ref>
