'''''Incunabula''''' is a [[video game]] designed by Steve Estvanik and released by [[Avalon Hill]] for [[IBM PC compatible]]s in 1984. It is the original computerized version of ''[[Civilization (1980 board game)|Civilization]]'' [[board game]], preceding  [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' which was published in 1991.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay loosely follows the rules of [[Francis Tresham (game designer)|Francis Tresham]]'s ''[[Civilization (1980 board game)|Civilization]]'' [[board game]]. It consists of three type of "scenarios", Incunabula, Imperium, and Traders.  Incunabula resembles the board game most.  One to three players can play and the computer players can be randomly assigned basis of law and "personality".  The personalities determine how likely a computer opponent is to attack you.  Personalities are:
*Choleric 
*Phlematic
*Melancholic
*Sanguine

The choices for basis of law are:
*Theocracy
*Oligarchy
*Utopia
*Khanate

Combat follows ''Civilization'' rules with a one for one unit loss.  There are no technologies to obtain but each player's progress is tracked through phases such as clan and tribe. The game is won on the basis of accumulating trade.

The different laws and personalities, and random starting positions, are the only game variations. There is only one map, and no varying difficulty level.{{r|mackames198512}}

==Reception==
[[Jerry Pournelle]] in 1985 reported that Avalon Hill's ''Incunabula'' and ''By Fire and Sword'' "snaffled off more of my time than I could afford".<ref name="pournelle198509">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-09/1985_09_BYTE_10-09_Homebrewing#page/n329/mode/2up | title=PCs, Peripherals, Programs, and People | work=BYTE | date=September 1985 | access-date=20 March 2016 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=347}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' that year noted the resemblance to Avalon Hill's ''Civilization'' board game and wondered why the company did not call the video game ''Computer Civilization'', and cautioned that because of the lack of map variations or difficulty levels, "the probable solitaire life of the game could be rather limited". It nonetheless concluded, "Incunabula is an interesting and enjoyable multi-player game. The combination of combat, good trading, and diplomacy will give a wide variety of gamers something worth a closer look".{{r|mackames198512}} In 1990 and 1993 the magazine gave the game three stars out of five.<ref name="brooks199010">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 | title=Computer Strategy and Wargames: Pre-20th Century | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1990 | access-date=16 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
