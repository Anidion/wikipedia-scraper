'''''Raid on Bungeling Bay''''' (バンゲリングベイ lit.: Bungeling Bay) is a [[shoot 'em up]] video game developed by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] and published by [[Broderbund]] for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1984. It was the first [[video game]] designed by Will Wright. The Commodore 64 version was published in the UK by [[Ariolasoft]]. The game inspired Wright to develop ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'' in 1989.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Raid on bungeling bay.gif|thumb|left|Commodore 64 screenshot]]
''Raid on Bungeling Bay'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[shoot 'em up]]. The player controls a [[helicopter]] launched from an [[aircraft carrier]] to bomb six [[factories]] scattered across islands on a small planetoid occupied by the Bungeling Empire (frequent villains in Broderbund games), while fending off escalating counterattacks by [[gun turret]]s, [[fighter jet]]s, [[guided missile]]s, and a [[battleship]]. There is also a hidden island for the player to reload on. Failure means that the Bungeling Empire develops a war machine to take over the planet [[Earth]]. Players have to attack its [[infrastructure]] while defending the [[aircraft carrier]] which serves as home base.

The game offers an insight into the design style of Wright, who also designed ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]''. Over time, the factories grow and develop new technologies to use against the player. There are also visible signs of interdependency among the islands, such as supply boats moving between them. In order to win the game, the player must prevent the escalation by bombing all the factories as quickly as possible, keeping them from advancing their technology. If left alone for too long, the factories create enough new weaponry to overwhelm the player.

==Ports==
''Raid on Bungeling Bay'' was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]] by Hudson Soft. Hudson published this version and released it in Japan on February 15, 1985.<ref name="hudsonfc"/> A conversion for the arcade-based VS. System was created based on this port, and it was distributed to arcades in Japan by Nintendo.<ref name="vsbbj">{{cite magazine|title=Raid on Bungeling Bay|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=258|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 April 1985|page=21|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19850415p.pdf#page=11}}</ref> Although a United States release was planned for the Summer of 1985,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flyerfever.com/vs-system-making-money-is-no-sweat/|title=VS.-Pak Library of Proven Best Sellers|publisher=Flyer Fever}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Great Screen Test of 1985: Nintendo|magazine=[[Cashbox (magazine)|The Cash Box]]|volume=49|issue=11|publisher=The Cash Box Publishing|date=1985-08-24|page=41}}</ref> Will Wright stated in an interview that he was not sure if it actually did get released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjAZjLWw0LA&t=4368|title=Will Wright's lost arcade game lost in a fire.

The Japanese releases of the game are alternatively titled {{nihongo|''Bungeling Bay''|バンゲリングベイ|Bangeringu Bei}}.

==Reception==
''Raid on Bungeling Bay'' for the Commodore 64 sold about 20,000 to 30,000 units in America, while the NES version sold about a million units in Japan. Will Wright attributed this large discrepancy to the lack of [[software piracy]] on the NES due to its cartridge system, along with ''Raid'' being one of the first American games published in Japan. Sales of the game gave Wright the financial freedom to create SimCity.<ref name="gamasutrareplay">{{cite news |last=Donovan |first=Tristan |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134754/the_replay_interviews_will_wright.php |title=The Replay Interviews: Will Wright |work=[[Gamasutra]] |date=2011-05-23 |access-date=2017-02-19}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Wright continued to develop the editor for the game as a personal toy because he enjoyed it so much. He researched [[urban planning]] and realised that others might enjoy constructing and building cities themselves. The result was a more advanced [[Simulation game|simulation]] that eventually became ''SimCity''.<ref name=gg>{{cite episode | title=Interview with Will Wright | series=Good Game | airdate=2008-03-10 | season=4 | number=5}}</ref>
