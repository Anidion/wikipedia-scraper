Unlike the forced scrolling format of the first game, ''Vanguard II'' takes place in [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down]] multi-directional scrolling stages. The ship can move in eight directions as it flies over a floating alien platform with the goal of destroying the power pods providing the station with energy. Aerial defenses must be shot down, while pods on the platform must be bombed with the aid of a crosshair. Once the players have destroyed enough pods they can bomb the core, which destroys the platform and ends the level.<ref name=HG101>{{cite web | url = http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/vanguard-ii/ | last=Vark | first=Aaron | date = October 17, 2015 | title = Vanguard II | accessdate = | work = at Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref>
