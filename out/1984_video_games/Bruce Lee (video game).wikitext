'''''Bruce Lee''''' is a [[platform game]] written by Ron J. Fortier for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published in 1984 by [[Datasoft]].<ref name=giantlist/> The graphics are by Kelly Day and music by John A. Fitzpatrick. The player takes the role of [[Bruce Lee]], while a second player controls either Yamo or alternates with player one for control of Bruce Lee.

[[Commodore 64]]<ref>{{lemon64 game|id=376}}</ref> and [[Apple II]] versions were released the same year. The game was converted to the [[ZX Spectrum]]<ref>{{WoS game|id=0000718|name=Bruce Lee}}</ref> and [[Amstrad CPC]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpczone.net/index.php?game=161 |title=''Bruce Lee'' by US Gold |accessdate=2007-09-26 |work=CPCZone |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815193121/http://www.cpczone.net/index.php?game=161 |archive-date=2007-08-15 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and published by [[U.S. Gold]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Bruceleegame.png|upright=2|left|thumb|Bruce and the Ninja are fighting at the bottom centre. Yamo is preparing to fall from the left-hand platform (ZX Spectrum).]]

The plot involves the eponymous martial artist advancing from chamber to chamber in a wizard's tower, seeking to claim infinite wealth and the secret of immortality. There are twenty chambers, each represented by a single screen with platforms and ladders. To progress, the player must collect a number of lanterns suspended from various points in the chamber.

Most chambers are guarded by two mobile enemies; The [[Ninja]], who attacks with a "[[bokken]] stick"<ref>Bruce Lee game manual</ref> and The Green Yamo, a large unarmed warrior, visually styled as a [[sumo]] wrestler but attacking with punches and "crushing kicks". On platforms with sufficient graphics support, Yamo's skin is actually pictured as green, though in cover art he has a natural human skin tone.

A multiplayer mode allows a second player to control Yamo, or to allow two players to alternately control Bruce. If the player playing Yamo is inactive for a certain time, the computer takes over. The Ninja and Yamo are also vulnerable to the screen's dangers, but have infinite lives so they always return; whereas Yamo is consistently identified as a single person, one version of the manual implies that each reappearance of the ninja is a new individual, replacing the previous one.

Later chambers include more hazards such as mines and moving walls, as well as a "comb-like" surface that has an electric spark racing along it. Skilful walking, climbing, ducking and jumping are required to negotiate them. On the twentieth screen, Lee finally faces the evil Fire Wizard.

Upon completing the game, it "loops" again. From the second loop on, the Ninja and Yamo are replaced as soon as they are killed, and the safe spots in the room with multiple electrified combs are removed.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that the Atari version "delivers all the foot kicking, kick jabbing, quick ducking action-packed adventure you'd expect from a good [[B movie|grade B]], martial arts movie".<ref name="stone198406">{{cite magazine | title=Bruce Lee | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | volume=4 | issue=3 | date=June 1984 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_4.3.pdf | accessdate=2016-04-17 | last=Stone | first=David P. | pages=31â€“32}}</ref> The ZX Spectrum version of Bruce Lee received enthusiastic reviews.

In a 1990 retrospective, ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' found that ''Bruce Lee'' was still too easy to complete and the graphics had not aged well. In addition, it was felt that the fighting moves available to the player lacked impact and were too limited for a beat 'em up. It was described as a historically important game, being the first to combine the platform/collection and beat 'em up genres.<ref name="YS">{{cite journal|date=May 1990|title=The YS Complete Guide To Beat-'em-ups|journal=Your Spectrum|issue=53|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/completeguidetobeatemups.htm|accessdate=2007-09-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083716/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/completeguidetobeatemups.htm|archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref>
