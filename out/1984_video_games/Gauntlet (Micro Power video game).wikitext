==Gameplay==
[[Image:Gauntlet (1984, Micro Power) in-game screenshot (Acorn Electron).png|thumb|left|Electron screenshot]]

The player controls an X15 spacecraft, protecting canisters from the hostile ''Reeg'' forces.<ref name="cassette1984">{{cite journal |year=1984|title = Acorn Electron cassette inlay |journal=Gauntlet}}</ref> In the game, Reeg ''landers'' search the landscape for canisters. If a lander grabs a canister and makes it to the top of the screen, it turns into a ''mutant''. The player must shoot the enemy ship to release a grabbed canister, but if it falls too far, then it's destroyed on impact. There are also other ships such as ''cruisers'', which when hit, unleash ''buzzer'' ships.<ref name="cassette1984"/>

The player has smart bombs available which destroy all on-screen enemies. On the higher levels there are additional enemy ships such as ''mine layers'' which are capable of launching ''killer'' ships, unless the player can destroy them quickly. If the player allows destruction of all canisters, then a hoard of mutants attack and the landscape completely disappears.<ref name="cassette1984"/>
