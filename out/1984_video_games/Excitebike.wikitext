{{nihongo foot|'''''Excitebike'''''|エキサイトバイク|Ekisaitobaiku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[motocross]] [[racing video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]]. In Japan, it was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in 1984 and then ported to arcades as ''VS. Excitebike'' for the [[Nintendo VS. System]] later that year. In North America, it was initially released for arcades in 1985 and then as a [[launch game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] later that year, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling Nintendo Entertainment System video games|best-selling games]] on the console. It is the first game in the ''Excite'' series.

Designed and directed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the smooth [[side-scrolling]] [[game engine]] his team developed for ''Excitebike'' was later used to develop ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985), which had the effect of [[Mario]] smoothly [[accelerating]] from a walk to a run, rather than move at a constant speed.

''Excitebike'' was a critical and commercial success. It spawned several sequels and has been re-released multiple times onto other Nintendo platforms, such the [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]]s, and [[Nintendo Switch Online]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Excitebike (NES) screenshot.png|thumb|left|The player jumps high above the computer racers.]]
''Excitebike'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Racing video game|racing game]] in which the player takes control of a [[motocross]] racer. The two gameplay modes are Selection A as a solo race run, and Selection B against computer-controlled opponents. The objective of the game is to finish in third place or higher in a preliminary race to qualify for the Excitebike championship race.{{sfn|Nintendo|1985|pp=5–9}} The A button accelerates the bike, and the B button activates a turbo boost that enhances the bike's speed, but overheats the engine if it is used for too long, forcing an immobile cooldown period.{{sfn|Nintendo|1985|pp=3–4}} The engine's temperature can be reset by driving over arrows located along the course.{{sfn|Nintendo|1985|pp=5–9}} The player can use the directional pad to shift between lanes, and to shift the racer's balance midair after a jump.{{sfn|Nintendo|1985|pp=3–4}} Landing squarely on both wheels allows the racer to maintain momentum, but an uneven landing will result in a loss of speed or a crash.{{sfn|Nintendo|1985|pp=5–9}} Design Mode allows players to create tracks using 19 types of hurdles,{{sfn|Nintendo|1985|pp=9–12}} with options to save and load created tracks for the [[Famicom Data Recorder]] [[tape drive]], which was unreleased outside Japan.<ref name="NESEncyclo">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IE8IEAAAQBAJ&dq=%22Excitebike%22+-wikipedia&pg=PA72 |title=The NES Encyclopedia |last=Scullion |first=Chris |publisher=Pen & Sword Books |year=2019 |page=72 |isbn=9781526737809}}</ref>

==Other releases==
===''Vs. Excitebike''===
There are two enhanced versions, both titled ''Vs. Excitebike''.

The first version was released on [[VS. UniSystem]] for [[Video arcade|arcades]] in 1984, after the Famicom release. It is similar to its Famicom Disk System counterpart, though this version lacks the Design option, has three difficulty levels, and has other minor differences.

The second was released for the [[Famicom Disk System]] peripheral in 1988. The graphics and core gameplay are still the same, and the FDS version has several distinctive features that the NES and arcade versions lack:
* "Vs. Excite" mode puts two players competing against each other. The options include the maximum number of rounds to play, the track, and the number of laps.
* The music is completely different; none of the songs from the original game are present, and it has a gameplay theme. The music is composed by Soyo Oka.<ref>{{cite interview |url=https://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/soyooka.shtml | title=Game Music :: Interview with Soyo Oka (March 2011) | first=Soyo | last=Oka | interviewer=Chris Greening, Dave Harris | editor-first=Chris | editor-last=Greening | others=Trans. & local. Ben Schweitzer, Shota Nakama | date=March 2011 | access-date=November 3, 2018}}</ref>
* The "Original Excite" mode is based on the main mode of the arcade version, with minor differences such as a different color palette.
* Its writable disk format can save created tracks.

===''Excitebike: Bun Bun Mario Battle Stadium''===
{{nihongo foot|'''''Excitebike: Bun Bun Mario Battle Stadium''''',|エキサイトバイク ぶんぶんマリオバトルスタジアム|Ekisaito Baiku: Bunbun Mario Batoru Sutajiamu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} also known as ''Mario Excite Bike'' or ''BS Excitebike'', is for the Japan-only [[Satellaview]] peripheral for [[Super Famicom]]. As a remake of ''Excitebike'', the human racers have been replaced by [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Princess Peach]], [[Wario]], [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], and some of [[King Bowser|Bowser]]'s [[Koopa Troopas]]. The concept was unchanged except for a "SUPER" mode where the player has unlimited turbo, and coins spread across the courses to increase top speed.

===Re-releases===
''Excitebike'' can be unlocked in ''[[Excitebike 64]]'', which was released in 2000 for the [[Nintendo 64]]. It is also one of several unlockable NES games in ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'' for the [[GameCube]], released in 2001. The Nintendo 64 version restores the Save and Load functionality in Design mode, though it is limited to saving one custom track on the Game Pak, while the ''Animal Crossing'' version can be transferred to the [[Game Boy Advance]] by using a [[GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable|link cable]].<!-- I believe that ''Animal Crossing'' on the GC saves and loads NES save states to the GC memory card; I will double-check. --> ''Excitebike'' was also released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in the form of [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] cards, and later as a Game Pak for the ''[[List of Classic NES Series games|Classic NES Series]]''.

''Excitebike'' was added to the European [[Wii Virtual Console]] on February 16, 2007, the same day its spiritual successor, ''[[Excite Truck]]'', was released there. The game was later added to the North American [[Virtual Console]] on March 19.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.n-sider.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2681 |title=Three new releases for Virtual Console |publisher=N-Sider.com |date=March 19, 2007 |access-date=June 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515201242/http://www.n-sider.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2681 |archive-date=May 15, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It was re-released in North America for the [[Wii U Virtual Console]] on April 26, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/excitebike-wii-u|title=Excitebike|website=www.nintendo.com|access-date=February 21, 2019}}</ref> ''3D Classics: Excitebike'' was released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] as a [[launch game]] for the Nintendo eShop in [[Americas|America]], [[Japan]] and [[Europe]]; the game was initially offered for free for a period but then was sold at £5.40 / €6.00 for European markets<ref>{{cite web|title=3D Classics Excitebike |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/games/nintendo_3ds_download_software/3d_classics_excitebike_43152.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910043915/http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/games/nintendo_3ds_download_software/3d_classics_excitebike_43152.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |publisher=Nintendo of Europe |access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref> and $5.99 in the US.<ref>{{cite web|title=3D Classics Excitebike|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rzR2UbTBHzXgiibdHhfKQZD3PTzDUTG3|publisher=Nintendo of America|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref> It features 3D stereoscopic support and analog control support.

The game has received generally positive reviews. [[Allgame]] gave ''Excitebike'' its highest possible rating of five stars. The review referred to the game as a "staple of any NES collection", praising its graphics as cute and its control as simple that still require strategy to apply properly. The review noted the design mode, as "the first of its kind in a console game, and greatly extends the life of the title by featuring 19 different components you can piece together to build your own course".<ref name="allgame-review" /> ''[[IGN]]'' praised the NES version in 2007, as "ridiculously addictive" and that it "proves video games don't need to have flashy graphics or complex AI to actually be fun. Sure, there are other racing games out there today, hundreds of them. This one may not necessarily be better than the recent stuff, but it's unique, addictive, and demonstrates what gaming is really about".<ref name="ign-nes">{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2007/03/22/excitebike-review|publisher=[[IGN]]|title=Excitebike Review |access-date=May 6, 2015|date=March 21, 2007|last=Birnbaum|first=Mark}}</ref> ''IGN'' ranked ''Excitebike'' as the 14th best NES game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top 100 NES Games |url=https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games/ |website=ign.com |access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref> ''[[GamesRadar]]'' ranked it as the 12th best game on the NES Classic Edition, saying that it has aged well with "a great sense of speed while driving and an excellent sense of balance while jumping and landing".<ref name="Best and Worst Gamesradar">{{cite web | title=The Best (And Worst) Games on the NES Classic Edition | date=December 19, 2016 | first=Connor | last=Trinske | url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-best-and-worst-games-on-the-nes-classic-edition/2/ | access-date=November 3, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Game Informer]]'' ranked the game 44 on its top 100 games of all time.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Cork|first=Jeff|title=Game Informer's Top 100 Games Of All Time (Circa Issue 100)|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2009/11/16/game-informer-s-top-100-games-of-all-time-circa-issue-100.aspx|access-date=November 30, 2020|magazine=Game Informer|language=en}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The [[side-scrolling]] gameplay of ''Excitebike'' was key to the development of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985). The same Miyamoto-led team that developed ''Excitebike'' went on to develop a 1985 NES port of side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]] arcade game ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' (1984) called ''Kung Fu''. Miyamoto's team used the technical knowledge they had gained from working on both side-scrollers to further advance the platforming "[[Platform game|athletic game]]" genre they had created with ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' (1981) and were key steps towards Miyamoto's vision of an expansive side-scrolling platformer.<ref name="Miyamoto Reveals All">{{cite web |last=Gifford |first=Kevin |title=Super Mario Bros.' 25th: Miyamoto Reveals All |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/super-mario-bros-25th-miyamoto-reveals-all.html |website=[[1UP.com]] |access-date=October 24, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105015455/http://www.ugo.com/games/super-mario-bros-25th-miyamoto-reveals-all.html |archive-date=January 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=Beyond Donkey Kong: A History of Nintendo Arcade Games |date=July 30, 2020 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-4176-8 |page=149 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXD0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA149}}</ref> While working on ''Excitebike'' and ''Kung Fu'', he devised the concept of a platformer in which the player can "strategize while scrolling sideways" over long distances, and has colorful backgrounds rather than black.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[Shigeru Miyamoto]] |date=December 2010 |title=Super Mario Bros. 25th Anniversary - Interview with Shigeru Miyamoto #2 |language=Japanese |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNa0M1gymgA |publisher=[[Nintendo Channel]] |access-date=April 12, 2021}}</ref> ''Super Mario Bros.'' utilized the fast scrolling [[game engine]] Miyamoto's team had originally developed for ''Excitebike'', which allowed [[Mario]] to smoothly [[accelerate]] from a walk to a run, rather than move at a constant speed like in earlier platformers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Andrew |title=History of Digital Games: Developments in Art, Design and Interaction |date=March 16, 2017 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-317-50381-1 |pages=152–4}}</ref>
