'''''3D Silicon Fish''''' is a [[video game]] for the [[VIC-20]] published by Thor Computer Software in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fgasking.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/my-trip-to-retrovision-2010/|title=My Trip to 'Retrovision 2010'|publisher=Frank Gasking|date=2 October 2010|access-date=27 May 2014}}</ref> It was developed in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Plot==
According to the instruction manual, the game takes place on [[Earth]] in the future where inhabitants are dependent on [[silicon]] for technology. Unfortunately, the silicon reserves are running out, but another source of silicon has been located in a faraway part of the galaxy. A mercenary going by the name of Sillo is sent to the dangerous area with a vehicle called the "silicon fisher" to gather the silicon and transport the cargo back to Earth.

==Gameplay==
The game consists of a maze located above a stream that flows from the top to the bottom of the screen. The player navigates through the maze with the silicon fisher vehicle while looking for silicon that floats along the river. Collecting the silicon is done by positioning the vehicle towards the direction where the silicon is heading and throwing out a net to catch it. Every so often, an enemy called a "Kryllon" [[Materialization (science fiction)|materializes]] in the air and explodes after a short time span. If the player is within range of the explosion, they will be killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/3d-silicon-fish|title=3D Silicon Fish for Commodore 64|publisher=MobyGames|access-date=23 May 2014}}</ref>

As each level is completed, the speed of the game quickens along with more randomly appearing Kryllons. The colour of the levels change as the game goes on, and the music grows faster as the pace of the game accelerates.<ref>{{cite news |author=Retro Gamer Team |date=20 May 2009 |title=3D Silicon Fish Review |url=http://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/3d-silicon-fish/ |publisher=Retro Gamer |access-date=30 May 2014 }}</ref>
