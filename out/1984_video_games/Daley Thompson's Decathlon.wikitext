'''''Daley Thompson's Decathlon''''' is an [[Olympic video games|Olympic-themed]] [[sports video game]] developed and released by [[Ocean Software]] in 1984.<ref name='SU32'>{{cite news | first=Chris | last=Bourne | title=Daley takes the gold | date=November 1984 | publisher=[[EMAP]] | url =http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/032/ssftwre.htm | work =[[Sinclair User]] | access-date =6 January 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010223023123/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/032/ssftwre.htm | archive-date=2001-02-23}}</ref> It was released in the wake of [[Daley Thompson]]'s popularity following his gold medals in the [[decathlon]] at the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]]. The game is a licensed adaptation of [[Konami]]'s 1983 [[arcade game]] ''[[Track & Field (video game)|Track & Field]]''.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=oceanthehistory>{{Cite book|last1=Wilkins|first1=Chris|title=Ocean - The History|last2=Kean|first2=Roger M|publisher=Revival Retro Events|year=2013|url=https://archive.org/details/The_History_of_Ocean_Software_Retro_Fusion_Books}}</ref>{{rp|42,106}}

A second game, ''Daley Thompson's Super-Test'', was released the following year. The third title, ''Daley Thompson's Olympic Challenge'', was released in 1988 to coincide with the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic Games]].

==Gameplay==
The player takes part in the ten events of the modern decathlon:
* Day 1: [[100 metres]], [[long jump]], [[shot put]], [[high jump]], and [[400 metres]]
* Day 2: [[110 metre hurdles|110 hurdles]], [[pole vault]], [[Discus throw|discus]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], and [[1500 metres]]

The player starts the game with three lives; failure to reach the minimum standard in an event results in the loss of one life. Success in the 1500 metres event results in the game returning to Day 1 to repeat the events with more difficult qualification criteria.

Depending on the computer, running is simulated by hitting two keys (representing the left and right leg) alternately and as quickly as possible or by moving the joystick from side to side as quickly as possible. The game rapidly gained a reputation among players as a "joystick killer" because of the constant vigorous waggling of the joystick required during many of the events.

The Spectrum version was the first game to use [[Speedlock]], a fast loader on the computer.<ref name="crash">{{cite journal|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/44/david_aj.htm|last=Eddy|first=Richard|year=1987|publisher=Crash|issue=44|title=The One David|access-date=9 January 2013}}</ref>

==Music==
The soundtrack of the C64 version of the game was composed by David Dunn. The introduction music, by [[Martin Galway]], is based on the 1978 [[electronic music]] piece "[[Solid State Survivor|Rydeen]]" by [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (YMO).
