'''''Bomb Jack'''''<ref>{{nihongo|''Bomb Jack''|ボンジャック|Bon Jakku}}</ref> is a [[platform game]] published by [[Tehkan]] for arcades and later ported to home systems. The game was a commercial success for arcades and [[home computers]]. It was followed by several sequels: the console and computer game ''[[Mighty Bomb Jack]]'', the arcade game ''[[Bomb Jack Twin]]'',<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7180 |title=Bomb Jack |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate =5 Oct 2013}}</ref> and ''Bomb Jack II'' which was licensed for home computers only.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Bombjackarc.png|thumb|left|Arcade version, round 1]]
Bomb Jack is a hero who can perform high jumps and float in the air. His goal is to collect all 24 red bombs on the screen. The game's antagonists are enemies such as birds and mummies which, once they drop in the bottom of the screen, can morph into enemies such as flying saucers and orbs that float around the screen, making Jack lose a life if he touches them.

Once one bomb is collected, bombs will light up in sequence; if one lit bomb is collected, another will light up. Collecting bombs will increase the bonus meter at the top of the screen (lit bombs increase it more). When the meter is completely filled up, a circular bouncing "P" appears, and when collected, it will turn all the enemies into bonus coins for a short period during which Jack may collect them. Other similar bonuses are the ''B'' (Bonus) which increases the score multiplier (up to 5x), the ''E'' ([[Extra life|Extra]]) which gives an extra life, and the rare ''S'' (Special), which awards a free game. There are five different screens in the game, each featuring a distinct background and set of platforms (the fifth has no platforms at all). There is a special bonus for collecting 20, 21, 22, or 23 lit bombs at the end of a round.
