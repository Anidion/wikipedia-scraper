'''''Thayer's Quest''''' is a [[LaserDisc video game]] initially developed by [[RDI Video Systems]] in [[1984 in video gaming|1984]] for their unreleased [[Halcyon (console)|Halcyon console]], and later released in arcades as a conversion kit for ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'' and ''[[Space Ace]]''.<ref name="dlp">{{cite web|title=Thayer's Quest|url=http://www.dragons-lair-project.com/games/pages/tq.asp|website=Dragon's Lair Project}}</ref> In 1995 it was ported to home consoles and PC under the title '''''Kingdom: The Far Reaches'''''. The arcade machine had a membrane keypad for controls instead of a joystick. To help players learn the daunting&mdash;for an arcade game&mdash;controls, a small holder containing instructional leaflets was attached to the cabinet.<ref name="dlp"/> A sequel, '''''Kingdom II: Shadoan''''', was released in 1996.

==Plot==
One thousand years ago, the Five Kingdoms (Weigard, Illes, Iscar, the Far Reaches, and Shadoan) were united under the benevolent rule of the Elder Kings until the evil wizard Sorsabal allied himself with dark forces from the land of Shadoan. With their dreadful power, Sorsabal destroyed the Elder Kings and claimed Shadoan as his own domain. The Elder Kings preserved their power by parting the Hand of Quoid (pronounced "kwode") - the great Amulet that was the source and focus of all true magic - and creating the Five Relics. They concealed one Relic in each of the Five Kingdoms knowing that, if Sorsabal possessed the Hand, he would wield absolute control over all he surveyed. Indeed, Sorsabal and his dark minions are searching for the Relics. As Thayer Alconred - a sorcerer's apprentice and the last survivor of the Elder Kings' bloodline - the player must find the Relics and restore the Amulet of Power before Sorsabal does.

During the game, Thayer visits only three of the kingdoms and finds their relics.

==Gameplay==
The game is fully animated like ''Dragon's Lair'' but requires more than simply choosing when to fight or which way to dodge in accordance with the animation. Instead the player has full control over Thayer Alconred's movement to different areas and must find and use a variety of magical objects to overcome enemies and obstacles like in most later graphic adventure games. There are many ways to mess up and permanently lose the game. There are several branching paths, resulting in different dialogue. The RDI'S Computer voice sometimes gives hints and the player's score.

In ''Electronic Games'', Roger Sharpe concluded "For the home computer adventurer, who has long eschewed joysticks and buttons for the headier comforts of the keyboard, ''Thayer's Quest'' is reason enough to leave the computer behind for awhile and pass some time in the local arcade again."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Sharpe |first=Roger C. |date=April 1985 |title=Thayer's Quest |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_03_Number_04_1985-04_Reese_Communications_US/page/n57 |magazine=Electronic Games |publisher=Reese Communications Inc. |location=New York, NY |volume=3 |issue=4 |page=58 |issn=0730-6687 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>

The home versions of the game received mostly mediocre reviews. Critics disparaged the trial-and-error gameplay,<ref name="NGen12">{{cite journal|title=Kingdom: The Far Reaches|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=12|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=December 1995|page=186}}</ref><ref name="GPro88">{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Kingdom: The Far Reaches|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=85|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=October 1995|page=96}}</ref> general repetitiveness,<ref name="EWrev">{{cite magazine|last=Rose|first=Michael T.|title=News|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1995/07/21/kingdom-far-reaches|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=29 October 2016|date=July 21, 1995}}</ref><ref name="NGen12"/> limited interaction,<ref name="EWrev"/><ref name="Max1">{{cite journal|title=Maximum Reviews: Kingdom: The Far Reaches|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=1|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1995|page=159}}</ref> and unimaginative and poor quality [[full-motion video]] (likened by many critics to a [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]).<ref name="EWrev"/><ref name="Max1"/><ref name="NGen12"/><ref name="GPro88"/> While Scary Larry of ''[[GamePro]]'' praised the gameplay for being much less linear than ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'', he felt this was insufficient to make it appeal to seasoned gamers.<ref name="GPro88"/>

==Legacy==
A sequel incorporating the rest of Thayer Alconred's journey was planned, but the company went bankrupt before it could be completed.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the mid-1990s, ''Thayer's Quest'' was released to home computers and CD-based consoles titled ''Kingdom: The Far Reaches'', with the characters' names changed (Thayer Alconred became Lathan Kandor, Sorsabal became Torlock, etc., because creator Rick Dyer thought the original character and names were "too 70's") and additional animation and puzzles.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1996 ''Kingdom II: Shadoan'' was released for PC and CD-i, including the final two kingdoms and the final battle with Torlock. ''Shadoan'' was developed over nine months on a budget of over 3 million US dollars, with more than 300 animators working on the project.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Shadoan |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=87|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1996|page=42}}</ref> In 2005 the original ''Thayer's Quest'' was released as a [[DVD]] video game by [[Digital Leisure]], Inc. (true to the original Halcyon version) and could be played on an ordinary DVD player using the remote control. ''Thayer's Quest'' was also released for the [[CD-ROM]] by Digital Leisure.
