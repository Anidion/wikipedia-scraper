Although the cassette inlay gives the release date as 1984, some sources state the release date as 1983, and the game is also known as ''Stock Car Racer''.<ref name="gamefaqs-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/bbc/949710-stock-car-racer|title=Stock Car Racer for BBC Micro|accessdate=2010-10-08|publisher=www.gamefaqs.com|quote=Stock Car Racer is a Racing game, developed and published by Micro Power, which was released in Europe in 1983.}}</ref><ref name="gamespot-1">{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/bbc/driving/stockcarracer/tech_info.html?tag=tabs%3Bsummary|title=Stock Car Racer for BBC Micro|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2010-10-09|quote=Stock Car Racer Tech Info}}</ref>

''Stock Car'' is similar to [[Atari, Inc.]]'s ''[[Sprint 2]]'' arcade game (1976) and ''[[Indy 500 (1977 video game)|Indy 500]]'' for the Atari VCS (1977).

==Gameplay==
[[File:Stock Car in-game screenshot (Acorn Electron).png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot (Acorn Electron)]]

The game provides a top-down view of one of six user-selectable racing tracks. One or two human players in red cars compete against yellow computer-controlled cars. Oil slicks can be added which cause the cars to veer off-course, making the game more challenging. The amount of skidding can also be selected by the player. A race consists of anything between 1 and 40 laps.<ref name="cimweb-1"/>

Players can steer their car left and right, but unlike most racing games, there are no keys for directly braking or accelerating. Instead, the player drives by selecting one of four gears (or neutral) and the car will accelerate according to the currently selected gear.<ref name="onlineracedriver-1">{{cite web|url=http://onlineracedriver.com/2010/08/17/the-stuff-racing-dreams-are-made-of/|title=The stuff racing dreams are made of|first=Tom|last=Bowker|date=2010-08-17|accessdate=2010-10-08|publisher=onlineracedriver.com|quote=To drive the car you didn’t have an ‘accelerate’ and ‘brake’ but instead a choice of four gears which gradually increased and decreased your speed.}}</ref>

==Reception==
Tom Bowker describes the game as "primitive", but he "loved it deeply".<ref name="onlineracedriver-1"/>

The game was reviewed in the August 1984 edition of ''[[Acorn User]]'' (Issue 25)

==Legacy==
Another game, ''Grand Prix'' by S. Merrigan on the ''Triple Deckers volume 1'' compilation was described by Dave Reeder as "a very poor copy of Stock Car".<ref name="acornelectron-2">{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/aab/revs/alternative/r-tds.html|title=Triple Deckers|accessdate=2010-10-08|publisher=A&B Computing Volume 5 No. 03|quote=Volume 1 contains a very poor copy of STOCK CAR by S.
