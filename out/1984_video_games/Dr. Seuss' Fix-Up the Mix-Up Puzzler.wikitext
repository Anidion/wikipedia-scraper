Designed for children ages 4â€“10, '''''Dr. Seuss' Fix-Up the Mix-Up Puzzler''''' is an electronic [[sliding puzzle]] featuring six [[Dr. Seuss]] characters: [[the Cat in the Hat]], [[the Grinch]], a [[The Sneetches and Other Stories|Star-Bellied Sneetch]], the Doorman, and the Woset and Clark. The objective of the game is to reassemble scrambled pictures, each of which is composed of three characters.

== Gameplay ==
There are five [[difficulty level]]s from which to choose. In the easiest level, kids can mix and match the characters' heads, torsos and feet any way they like. In higher levels of play, there are more puzzle pieces, some of which are upside down, and characters must be assembled in their original left-to-right order. Puzzles range in size from 9 to 25 pieces. The fifth level has a time limit which, when beaten, will give the player bonus points.

The manual for ''Dr. Seuss' Fix-Up the Mix-Up Puzzler'' claims that the game promotes "problem-solving strategies, logic, pattern recognition, memory and a variety of other early learning skills."
