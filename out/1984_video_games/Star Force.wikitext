{{nihongo foot|'''''Star Force''''',|スターフォース|Sutā Fōsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} also released in arcades outside of Japan as '''''Mega Force''''', is a [[shoot 'em up|vertical-scrolling shooter]] computer game released in 1984 by [[Tecmo|Tehkan]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:ARC Star Force (Mega Force).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]
In the game, the player pilots a starship called the ''Final Star'', while shooting various enemies and destroying enemy structures for points.

Unlike later vertical scrolling shooters, like [[Toaplan]]'s ''[[Twin Cobra]]'', the ''Final Star'' had only two levels of weapon power and no secondary weapons like missiles and/or bombs. Each stage in the game was named after a letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. In certain versions of the game, there is an additional level called "Infinity" (represented by the infinity symbol) which occurs after Omega, after which the game repeats indefinitely.

In the [[NES]] version, after defeating the Omega target, the player can see a black screen with [[Tecmo]]'s logo, announcing the future release of the sequel ''[[Super Star Force]]''. After that, the infinity target becomes available and the game repeats the same level and boss without increasing the difficulty.

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Star Force'' on its December 1, 1984, issue as the fourteenth most-successful table arcade unit at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=249|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 December 1984|page=31|lang=ja}}</ref>

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
* ''[[Super Star Force: Jikūreki no Himitsu]]'', released in 1986 for the Japanese Nintendo Famicom.
* ''[[Final Star Force]]'', released for arcades in 1992.

===Ports and related releases===
''Star Force'' was ported and published in 1985 by [[Hudson Soft]] to both the [[MSX]] home computer and the [[Family Computer]] (Famicom) in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hudson - Shooting game [NES] (Archive)|url=http://www.hudson.co.jp/user/stgfc.html|website=Hudson|access-date=31 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970206223032/http://www.hudson.co.jp/user/stgfc.html|archive-date=6 February 1997}}</ref>  Sales of the game were promoted through the first nationwide video game competition to be called "a caravan", although it was not the first event of its kind organized by Hudson (they had previously promoted [[Lode Runner]] with a similar event).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-master-speaks-hudson-s-takahashi-meijin-goes-retro|title=The Game Master Speaks: Hudson's 'Takahashi-Meijin' Goes Retro|date=October 2, 2008|website=Game Developer}}</ref>

The North American and European versions for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) were published two years later, in 1987, with significant revisions, and with Tecmo credited rather than Hudson on the title screen and box art.  According to [[Keiji Yamagishi]], the NES version was created separately at Tecmo and is distinct from the port released for the Famicom by Hudson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bravewave.net/interviews/a-conversation-with-keiji-yamagishi|title=A Conversation with Keiji Yamagishi|website=Brave Wave Productions}}</ref> Although the NES version is immediately recognizable as having a great deal in common with the Hudson version released in Japan, there are significant alterations to the graphics, music, and controls and gameplay.  Several bugs in gameplay were fixed (debatably making the NES version more difficult) that allow the player (in the Japanese version) to prevent new enemies from appearing ("spawning") by ''not'' shooting the enemies already on screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Force|title=Star Force|date=September 12, 2022|website=StrategyWiki}}</ref>

''Star Force'' was also ported to the [[SG-1000]] by [[Sega]], [[X68000]] by Dempa Shimbunsha and [[mobile phone]]s by Tecmo.

In 1995, along with two other NES shooters, the Famicom version of ''Star Force'' was remade by Hudson Soft with minimal upgrades for the Super Famicom as part of the Japan-only release of the ''[[Caravan Shooting Collection]]''. The same version was also included in Hudson's compilation of NES shooters in 2006 in ''Hudson Best Collection Vol. 5''.

The original arcade version was later added to the compilation titled ''[[Tecmo Classic Arcade]]'', which was released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. In 2009, the arcade version was made available for download on the [[Wii Virtual Console]] for 500 [[Wii Points]] as one of the four initial offerings for the "Virtual Console Arcade" category of the [[Wii Shop Channel]] (the other three being ''[[Gaplus]]'', ''[[Mappy]]'', and ''[[The Tower of Druaga]]'' from [[Namco]]).

In 1986, Hudson Soft released the shoot 'em up game ''[[Star Soldier (video game)|Star Soldier]]'', which is considered a spiritual successor to ''Star Force''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hg101.kontek.net/starsoldier/starsoldier.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Star Soldier|website=hg101.kontek.net}}</ref> The game spawned [[Star Soldier|numerous sequels]].
