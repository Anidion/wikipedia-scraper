'''''Kung-Fu Master''''', known as {{nihongo foot|'''''Spartan X'''''|スパルタンX|Suparutan X|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan, is a [[side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] developed by [[Irem]] as an [[arcade video game]] in 1984, and distributed by [[Data East]] in North America. Designed by [[Takashi Nishiyama]], the game was based on [[Hong Kong martial arts films]]. It is a loose adaptation of the [[Jackie Chan]], [[Sammo Hung]], and [[Yuen Biao]] film ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' (1984), called ''Spartan X'' in Japan, with the protagonist Thomas named after Jackie Chan's character in the film. The game is also heavily inspired by the [[Bruce Lee]] film ''[[Game of Death]]'' (1972), which was the basis for the game's concept. Nishiyama, who had previously designed the [[side-scrolling shooter]] ''[[Moon Patrol]]'' (1982), combined fighting elements with a [[shoot 'em up]] gameplay rhythm. Irem and Data East exported the game to the West without the ''Spartan X'' license.

The player controls Thomas, the titular Kung-Fu Master, as he fights his way through the five levels of the Devil's Temple to rescue his girlfriend Sylvia from the crime boss Mr. X. As he ascends the tower, he has to fight many enemies along the way and five end-of-level [[boss battles]], a concept inspired by ''Game of Death''. Thomas and each boss have a [[health meter]], and the game temporarily becomes a one-on-one [[fighting game]] during boss battles.

The game was a major commercial success, topping the Japanese arcade charts and becoming America's second highest-grossing [[1985 in video games|arcade game of 1985]], while receiving critical acclaim for its fast-paced, side-scrolling gameplay and detailed, colorful graphics. A port for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (known as the Famicom in Japan) was developed by [[Nintendo]] under the direction of [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], released as ''Spartan X'' in Japan and '''''Kung-Fu''''' in the West, selling 3.5 million copies worldwide. It was also one of the top five best-selling [[Commodore 64]] games of 1986. It spawned the sequel ''[[Spartan X 2]]'' (1991) and the spiritual successors ''[[Trojan (video game)|Trojan]]'' (1986) and ''[[Vigilante (video game)|Vigilante]]'' (1988).

''Kung-Fu Master'' was a highly influential game. It is regarded as the first beat 'em up brawler, and an early example of the side-scrolling character [[action game]] genre, which became popular during the mid-to-late 1980s. Miyamoto's work on the NES port inspired his development of the side-scrolling [[platform game]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985), while Nishiyama was hired by [[Capcom]] where he used the game's boss battles as the basis for the fighting game ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' (1987), before working for [[SNK]] on fighting games such as ''[[Fatal Fury]]'' and ''[[The King of Fighters]]''. ''Kung-Fu Master'' also influenced other media, such as the [[Red Ribbon Army]] saga (1985–1986) of the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', as well as the French film ''[[Kung Fu Master (film)|Kung Fu Master]]'' (1988).

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Kung fu master mame.png|left|thumb|Arcade screenshot]]
The player controls Thomas with an eight-way joystick and two attack buttons to punch and kick. Unlike more conventional side-scrolling games, the joystick is used not only to crouch, but also to jump. Punches and kicks can be performed from a standing, crouching or jumping position. Punches award more points than kicks and do more damage, but their range is shorter. Thomas has a [[health meter]] indicating how much damage he can take.<ref name="Lendino">{{cite book |last1=Lendino |first1=Jamie |title=Attract Mode: The Rise and Fall of Coin-Op Arcade Games |date=27 September 2020 |publisher=Steel Gear Press |pages=289–90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6wCEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA289}}</ref><ref name="Williams">{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Andrew |title=History of Digital Games: Developments in Art, Design and Interaction |date=16 March 2017 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-317-50381-1 |pages=143–6}}</ref> He can absorb a significant amount of damage, but loses a [[Life (video games)|life]] if he takes too many hits.<ref name="CVG"/>

Underlings encountered by the player include Grippers, who can grab Thomas and drain his energy until shaken off; Knife Throwers, who can throw at two different heights and must be hit twice; and Tom Toms, short fighters who can either grab Thomas or somersault to strike his head when he is crouching. On even-numbered floors, the player must also deal with falling balls and pots, snakes, poisonous moths, fire-breathing dragons, and exploding confetti balls.

The Devil's Temple has five floors, each ending with a different [[boss (video games)|boss]] (described as "sons of the devil" at the start of the game). Each boss has a health meter like Thomas, which leads to the game temporarily becoming a one-on-one [[fighting game]] during a boss battle.<ref name="Lendino"/><ref name="Williams"/> In order to complete a floor, Thomas must connect enough strikes to completely drain the boss's energy meter; he can then climb the stairs to the next floor. Thomas has a fixed time limit to complete each floor; if time runs out or his meter is completely drained, the player loses one life and must replay the entire floor. Upon completing a floor, the player receives bonus points for remaining time and energy.

The bosses of the first four levels are Stick Fighter, Boomerang Fighter, Giant, and Black Magician.<ref name="RG"/> The boss of the fifth floor is Mr. X, the leader of the gang that kidnapped Sylvia. Once he is defeated, Thomas rescues Sylvia and the game restarts at a higher difficulty level.

An extra life is given at 50,000 points; thereafter, the rest of the game is on "survival of the fittest" mode. Play continues until the last Thomas is dead, which ends the game.

==Development==
The game was designed for Irem by [[Takashi Nishiyama]].<ref name="Ishizaki">{{cite magazine |title=R-Type Sound Developer Interview – Masato Ishizaki |magazine=Shooting Gameside |date=March 25, 2014 |volume=9 |url=http://shmuplations.com/rtypesound/}}</ref><ref name="Lendino"/><ref name="HG101">{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Trojan |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/trojan/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=January 29, 2019 |access-date=14 April 2021}}</ref> ''Kung-Fu Master'' is based on [[Hong Kong martial arts films]]. It is a loose adaptation of the [[Jackie Chan]], [[Sammo Hung]], and [[Yuen Biao]] film ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' (1984), called ''Spartan X'' in Japan, specifically the final part of the film which involves Thomas (Jackie Chan) climbing a Spanish [[castle]] to rescue Sylvia ([[Lola Forner]]), with the help of Moby (Sammo Hung) and his cousin David (Yuen Biao).<ref name="thegamesmachine">{{cite web |last1=Dellafrana |first1=Danilo |title=Le origini di Street Fighter |url=https://www.thegamesmachine.it/speciali/90208/street-fighter/ |website=[[The Games Machine]] |access-date=20 March 2021 |language=it-IT |date=29 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="RG">{{cite magazine |last1=Mason |first1=Graeme |title=Kung-Fu Master |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |date=March 2015 |issue=140 |pages=70–5 |url=https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____140/70}}</ref> The game also borrows heavily from [[Bruce Lee]]'s 1972 film ''[[Game of Death]]'', with the five-level Devil's Temple reflecting the movie's setting of a five-level [[pagoda]] with a martial arts master in each level; in contrast, ''Wheels on Meals'' takes place in Spain as opposed to the game's [[East Asian]] setting.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Spencer |first1=Spanner |title=The Tao of Beat-'em-ups |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-tao-of-beat-em-ups-article?page=2 |access-date=20 July 2020 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=6 February 2008 |page=2}}</ref> The final part of ''Wheels on Meals'' had itself borrowed its concept of climbing an enemy base by fighting enemies along the way from ''Game of Death''.<ref name="thegamesmachine"/> The game was also influenced by the Bruce Lee film ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973).<ref name="RG"/>

Nishiyama had earlier created Irem's [[1982 in video gaming|1982]] arcade [[side-scrolling shooter]] game ''[[Moon Patrol]]''.<ref name="Ishizaki"/><ref name="1up">{{cite web|last=Leone |first=Matt |title=The Man Who Created Street Fighter |url=http://www.1up.com/features/the-man-who-created-street-fighter.html |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |access-date=12 April 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718180754/http://www.1up.com/features/the-man-who-created-street-fighter |archive-date=July 18, 2012}}</ref> Nishiyama designed ''Kung-Fu Master'' by combining a [[shoot 'em up]] gameplay rhythm with [[Fighting game|fighting]] elements.<ref name="Okamoto">{{cite news |last1=Okamoto |first1=Yoshiki |author1-link=Yoshiki Okamoto |last2=Nishiyama |first2=Takashi |author2-link=Takashi Nishiyama |title=[ENG SUB] A Talk Between the Creators of Street Fighter and Fatal Fury: KOF (Takashi Nishiyama) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqRFod7nuHo |access-date=17 July 2021 |work=世界の岡本吉起Ch |publisher=[[YouTube]] |language=ja |time=1:40}}</ref>

The music and sound for the arcade game were composed by Masato Ishizaki. Nishiyama initially believed the game did not need any music, as it was a [[martial arts]] game and he thought it would sound more impressive to just have the sound effects. Ishizaki had a melody in mind for the game, leading him to suggest that two versions be made, with and without the music, and asked to see which sounded better. After hearing both versions, Nishiyama agreed that the music version sounded better and included Ishizaki's melody in the game.<ref name="Ishizaki"/>

Prior to the game's development, Nishiyama was invited to join [[Capcom]] by its founder [[Kenzo Tsujimoto]] in 1983, after he had left Irem. Nishiyama decided to remain in Irem up until the development of ''Spartan X''. He eventually decided to leave Irem and join Capcom before the game was complete.<ref name="Okamoto"/> Ishizaki later went on to compose the music and sound for ''[[R-Type]]'' (1987).<ref name="Ishizaki"/>

==Release==
The arcade game was originally released as ''Spartan X'' in Japan, on November 24, 1984.<ref name="Copyright">{{cite web |title=Spartan X (Registration Number PA0000234444) |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov |website=[[United States Copyright Office]] |access-date=6 May 2021}}</ref> It was then released internationally as ''Kung-Fu Master'', in North America during late 1984<ref name="flyer">{{cite web |title=Video Game Flyers: Kung-Fu Master, Data East (DECO) |url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=576&image=1 |website=The Arcade Flyer Archive |access-date=12 April 2021}}</ref> and in Europe by early 1985.<ref name="CVG"/>

==Ports==
In June 1985, the game was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], known as the Famicom in Japan.<ref name="Iwata">{{cite web |title=Original Super Mario Developers: The New Guys, Too! |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/mario25th/4/1 |website=[[Iwata Asks]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=February 1, 2011 |access-date=12 April 2021}}</ref> It was released as ''Spartan X'' in Japan, before releasing internationally as ''Kung Fu'' in North America and [[PAL regions]].

The game was ported to the [[Atari 2600]] by programmer Dan Kitchen (brother of [[Garry Kitchen]]), shortly after he had ported ''[[Ghostbusters (1984 video game)|Ghostbusters]]'' (1984) to the Atari 2600. This port of ''Kung-Fu Master'' is considered a significant programming feat considering the technical limitations of the Atari 2600.<ref name="RG"/>

''Kung-Fu Master'' was also ported to the [[Atari 7800]],<ref name=man7800/> [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]] (Irem/[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]] version as ''Seiken Achō''), [[PlayChoice-10]] (arcade, nearly the same as the NES version), and [[ZX Spectrum]].

Claire Edgley of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the arcade game a positive review in March 1985. She was positively surprised by the "hard-hitting" action, the "very fast" and "breath-taking" pace, and large number of enemies. She also praised the controls, referring to Thomas as "a whirling, kicking, jumping, fighting machine" controlled by an eight-way joystick and two buttons, the "energy levels" which allow the player to "absorb a large number of hits" from enemies, the smooth "lifelike" picturesque graphics, and the catchy music jingles. She concluded that if "you thought that ''Karate Champ'' was good — wait 'til you try this one!"<ref name="CVG">{{cite magazine |last1=Edgeley |first1=Clare |title=Arcade Action: Can You Resist the Temptation? |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=16 March 1985 |issue=42 (April 1985) |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=92–3 |url=https://archive.org/details/computer-video-games-magazine-042/page/n91/mode/2up}}</ref>

Mike Roberts also gave the arcade game a positive review in the May 1985 issue of ''[[Computer Gamer]]''. He noted it was part of the "current craze" for arcade martial arts games, but said it had "more of a story line and game play" than others, noting the progression through five floors, simplified controls, abilities such as ducking and jumping, and multiple "standard baddies" followed by "super baddies" who are tougher to beat; he refers to the final opponent as the [[Boss (video games)|boss]] of organization X.<ref name="CG">{{cite magazine |last1=Roberts |first1=Mike |title=Coin-Op Connection |magazine=[[Computer Gamer]] |date=May 1985 |issue=2 |pages=26–7 |publisher=[[Argus Press]] |location=United Kingdom |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_02_1985-05_Argus_Press_GB/page/n25/mode/2up}}</ref> Matt Fox later reviewed the arcade game in 2013, praising the gameplay, animation and innovation.<ref name="Fox">{{cite book |last1=Fox |first1=Matt |title=The Video Games Guide: 1,000+ Arcade, Console and Computer Games, 1962-2012 |edition=2nd |date=3 January 2013 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-0-7864-7257-4 |page=162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzMYYrsDaAEC&pg=PA162}}</ref>

===Sequels and successors===
''[[List_of_SG-1000_games#List_of_SG-1000/SC-3000_series_games|Dragon Wang]]'' is an action game made by [[Sega]] for the [[SG-1000]] released in 1985 and was inspired by ''Kung-Fu Master''. The protagonist is Wang (inspired by Jackie Chan and/or his character Thomas) whose name means "King" in Chinese.

''[[My_Hero_(video_game)|My Hero]]'' was released by Sega for arcades in 1985 and for the [[Master System]] on January 1, 1986. The gameplay format is similar to Irem's ''Kung-Fu Master''.

After designing ''Kung-Fu Master'', Takashi Nishiyama was later hired by [[Capcom]].<ref name="1up"/> He designed an arcade successor for Capcom, ''[[Trojan (video game)|Trojan]]'' (1986), which evolved the basic gameplay concepts of ''Kung-Fu Master''. The NES port included a one-on-one fighting mode, a precursor to Nishiyama's work on ''Street Fighter''.<ref name="HG101"/>

''[[Kung Fu Kid]]'', known in Japan as ''Makai Retsuden'' (魔界列伝), is a Master System video game released in 1987. It is the follow-up to the Sega SG-1000 title ''Dragon Wang'' with both titles playing very closely to ''Spartan X''.

Originally in 1985, Irem began work on the prototype ''[[List_of_Irem_games#Prototypes|Super Kung-Fu Master]]'' which later expanded the work into an arcade sequel called ''Beyond Kung-Fu: Return of the Master'' under development and underwent location testing in 1987, but was shelved after it underperformed. ''Beyond Kung-Fu'' was then revamped into ''[[Vigilante (video game)|Vigilante]]'', after Irem decided to give the game a more Americanized setting, which was released in 1988.<ref>{{cite news |title=Long Lost Kung-Fu Master Sequel Found |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/blog_post/long-lost-kung-fu-master-sequel-found/ |access-date=12 April 2021 |work=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |date=29 April 2015}}</ref>

In 1990, the arcade game received a Game Boy sequel of the same name(s) as the 1984 original, which has similar gameplay to the arcade game, but with a completely different plot and setting with a new protagonist named "Bruce Leap" in the releases outside of Japan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hawken |first1=Kieren |title=The A-Z of Nintendo Game Boy Games: Volume 1 |date=31 August 2018 |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |isbn=978-1-78538-779-1 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8NBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT81}}</ref>

In 1991, a sequel was released in Japan for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]], titled ''[[Spartan X 2]]''. It was originally planned to release in North America as ''Kung Fu II'' in the fall of 1991, but ended up not releasing there.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wilds |first1=Stephen |title=8 NES Games That Were Never Officially Released |website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=12 October 2016 |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/nes/8-nes-games-that-were-never-released/ |access-date=15 April 2021}}</ref> ''Spartan X 2'' did not receive a North American release until 2016, when it was included as a built-in title for the Retro-Bit Generations retro video game console under the name ''Kung-Fu Master 2''.

Indie publisher and developer Toushiryoku Laboratory (闘志力研究所) released [[doujin game|doujin games]] ''Tifa Tan X'' (TifaTan X, ティファタンX) in 2004 and its sequel ''Tifa Tan X2'' (TifaTan X 2, ティファタンX2) in 2005 as light-hearted homages and [[ecchi]] style parodies of ''Spartan X'' for PC and stars [[Tifa Lockhart]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' as a playable character. Inspired heavily from ''Kung-Fu Master'', gameplay is similar across both titles with the second seeing improvement to overall gameplay, graphics, and sound. The second game also features other characters making cameos from other games as boss fights those being [[List_of_Darkstalkers_characters#Lilith|Lilith]] from ''[[Darkstalkers]]'', [[Mai Shiranui]] from ''[[Fatal Fury]]'', [[Athena_(video_game)#Plot|Princess Athena]] from her own game, [[Double_Dragon#Enemy_characters|Abobo]] from ''[[Double Dragon]]'', and a male [[Recurring_elements_in_the_Final_Fantasy_series#Classes|Red Mage]] from ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' who is the main antagonist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.squakenet.com/software-house/toushiryoku-laboratory/|title=List of games developed or published by "toushiryoku laboratory"|website=squakenet.com|access-date= 5 July 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myabandonware.com/game/tifa-tan-x-co6|title=TIFA TAN X WINDOWS - 2004|website=myabandonware}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myabandonware.com/game/tifa-tan-x-2-co7|title=TIFA TAN X 2WINDOWS - 2005|website=myabandonware}}</ref>

The plot features heroine Xiaomei, who embarks on a journey to save her older sister, Xiaoyin, from the evil influence of the Dark Dragon. The Switch version also comes with a new story from Xiaoyin's perspective in Xiaoyin Mode (after completing the main story), with new characters, and unlockables such as wallpapers and character illustrations. Players fight enemies on a single plane from left to right to reach and fight a boss at the end of each stage with a variety of moves including simple and kicks to jumping attacks along with more advanced moves such as a powerful downward strike and short ranged attacks among others. Moves can also be strung together into combos for extra damage and points. While fighting, item pickups can be available to restore health and augment the player's attacks. Enemies include the classic Gripper types the swarm and immobilize the player to drain health with flying birds and dragons attack them from above. Former [[Namco]] [[composer]] Norio Nakagata was brought onboard along with one-time Sega [[sound designer]] Hirofumi Murasaki to do the game's music and sound effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/xiaomei-and-the-flame-dragons-fist-is-a-16-bit-kung-fu-throwback-that-packs-a-punch|title=''Xiaomei And The Flame Dragon's Fist'' Is A 16-Bit Kung Fu Throwback That Packs A Punch|website=nintendolife|date=21 March 2023 |access-date=5 July 2023}}</ref> The game's illustrations and graphics are by Studio Vigor and character voices by Suika.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://leoful.com/xiaomei-and-the-flame-dragons-fist-en/|title=''Xiaomei and the Flame Dragon's Fist'' - leoful.com}}</ref>

''Kung Fu'' was one of the first NES titles that originated from a third-party developer, giving it a "special place" in the [[history of the Nintendo Entertainment System]] according to IGN.<ref name="IGN"/> ''Kung-Fu Master'' also influenced the combat system of ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web |last1=McWhertor |first1=Michael |title=Zelda 2 was Nintendo at its best: unpredictable |url=https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23600112/zelda-2-adventure-of-link-nes-tears-of-the-kingdom |website=Polygon |access-date=24 June 2024 |date=16 February 2023}}</ref>

[[Akira Toriyama]] cited the Famicom version of ''Spartan X'' as an inspiration for a major saga in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Dragon Ball]]'': the [[Red Ribbon Army]] saga (1985-1986), specifically the Muscle Tower arc, which involves [[Goku]] ascending an enemy base and fighting enemies on each floor. This arc was a turning point for ''Dragon Ball'', a departure from the [[tournament]] format of the previous saga.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: STORY GUIDE|year=1995|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=261–265|language=ja|isbn=4-08-782752-6}}

The game also influenced a French film called ''[[Kung Fu Master (film)|Kung Fu Master]]'' (1988) directed by [[Agnès Varda]]. Despite the title, it is not an adaptation of the game, nor is it a [[martial arts film]], but it is rather a [[drama film]] concerning a divorced mother falling in love with a 14 year-old video game player. The film showcases various arcade games, with the character's interest in the ''Kung-Fu Master'' arcade game being a central [[plot device]].<ref name="Ebert">{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |author1-link=Roger Ebert |title=Kung-fu master! |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/kung-fu-master-1989 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |date=November 17, 1989 |access-date=16 March 2021}}</ref>
