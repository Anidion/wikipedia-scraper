'''''Revenge of the Mutant Camels''''' is a [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|horizontally scrolling shooter]] written by [[Jeff Minter]] for the [[Commodore 64]] and published by [[Llamasoft]] in 1984. Enhanced versions for the [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]], and [[IBM PC]] were released in 1992 as [[shareware]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Revenge of the Mutant Camels Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Screenshot from the original Commodore 64 game.]]
A sequel of sorts to ''[[Attack of the Mutant Camels]]'' (also known as ''Advance of the Mega-Camels''), this time the player controls a camel. The camel is armed by default with small blue shots, but can obtain other weapons and weapon upgrades by collecting [[power-up]]s during the game. In all but the Commodore 64 version, the camel is teamed up with a bipedal goat, who can be controlled either by the computer or by a second player. If the camel crouches down, the goat can mount it and ride on its back, enabling them to focus their firepower.

The game features a host of bizarre enemies, including: British telephone boxes, [[Polo (confectionery)|Polo mints]], exploding sheep, skiing kangaroos, guys sitting on flying toilets, and even the jet plane controlled by the player in ''Attack of the Mutant Camels'' and a wave of Jeff Minters. In versions other than the Commodore 64 version, a variety of [[power-up]]s are available, including [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] tablets (for a turn of speed), [[Joint (cannabis)|spliff]]s (to fly over life's troubles), and apples (because they're good for you).

Unlike ''[[Attack of the Mutant Camels]]'', it is possible for the player to win ''Revenge''. After 42 waves of enemies<ref name="gruntingox">{{cite web |url=http://www.medwaypvb.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/gruntingoxfiles/Revenge%20of%20the%20Mutant%20Camels.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219051613/http://www.medwaypvb.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/gruntingoxfiles/Revenge%20of%20the%20Mutant%20Camels.htm |archive-date=19 December 2014 |title=Revenge of the Mutant Camels}}</ref> are defeated the player is declared the winner.  In the Commodore 64 version, this was indicated simply by the message "WELL DONE! YOU HAVE SAVED CAMELKIND!" being briefly flashed over the playfield before the game restarted on the first level.

==Development==
''Revenge of the Mutant Camels'' was announced in the Dec 1983/Jan 1984 issue of ''Commodore Horizons'' with a prospective release for mid-December 1984.<ref>{{cite journal|date=  December 1983 – January 1984|title=And now ... Revenge of the Mutant Camels|journal=Commodore Horizons|pages=9|publisher=Sunshine Books, Scot Press}}</ref> The game was written over a two month period.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/your-computer-magazine-1984-03/page/n56/mode/1up?view=theater | title=Your Computer Magazine (March 1984) | date=March 1984 }}</ref>

Ideas for various attack waves were created by Minter whilst on holiday in Crete and written down in a notebook. An innovation at the time was that this was the first UK program to use a fast loader – the German TURBO system.<ref>http://www.devili.iki.fi/pub/Commodore/docs/Project64/games/yak10.txt {{Bare URL plain text|date=March 2022}}</ref>  Minter was influenced by the reaction to the game ''[[Manic Miner]]'' having 20 levels, and so improved on this by creating 42 different levels for ''Revenge''.<ref name="gruntingox"/>

The theme music for the Commodore 64 version was arranged by [[James Lisney]] and was based on ''[[Ballet égyptien]]'' by [[Alexandre Luigini]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Legacy==
{{Confusing|section|date=May 2019}}

Llamasoft developed a sequel to ''Revenge of the Mutant Camels'' entitled ''Revenge of the Mutant Camels II'' for the PC. It was published by Kool Dog Entertainment, a division of Guildhall Leisure which has since closed down. Due to poor sales and reception the title was withdrawn from shelves just weeks after release.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The plot is a continuation of the story from the original Revenge of the Mutant Camels.

For [[Amiga]], ''Revenge of Mutant Camels II'' was released with poor reception<ref>38% from Zapp, 48% from The Games Machine</ref> by [[Mastertronic]] in 1988. This release did not involve Minter himself, but in 1992 Minter released his own Amiga version entitled simply ''Revenge of the Mutant Camels'' as a [[shareware]] game (this is similar to the Atari ST version).

Almost 40 years after its first release, in 2021 Jeff Minter fixed a bug on collision detection in the Commodore 64 version.
