'''''Star Fleet I: The War Begins''''' is a 1984 [[strategy video game]] designed by Trevor Sorensen<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0793579|title="Star Fleet I: The War Begins"}}</ref> and developed by Interstel (some versions by Cygnus Multimedia). It was released for [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[MS-DOS]] and [[Commodore 64]]. Versions for the [[Commodore 128]] (bundled together as Commodore 64/128, though it included a discrete version for the 128 with 80-column support), [[Atari ST]], and [[Atari 8-bit computers]] were released in 1986 and versions for the [[Amiga]] and [[Mac (computer)|Mac]] were released in 1987.<ref name="moby">{{moby game|id=/star-fleet-i-the-war-begins|name=''Star Fleet I: The War Begins''}}</ref> The game was successful enough to spawn sequels which are collectively known as the [[Star Fleet (video game series)|''Star Fleet'' series]].

==Description==
The game resembles the [[Star Trek (1971 video game)|''Star Trek'' text game]].{{r|murphy198609}}{{r|info198701amiga}}{{r|brooks199211}}<ref name="cgw199405">{{Cite magazine |date=May 1994|title=Taking A Peek|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=118|magazine=Computer Gaming World|pages=174–180}}</ref> The player is a new graduate of [[Starfleet Academy]] in command of a [[starship]]. The United Galactic Alliance (UGA) is at war with the Krellans and Zaldrons, so the player has plenty of combatants to engage from the beginning of the game.<ref name="moby" />

Eschewing [[computer graphics|digital graphics]], ''Star Fleet I'' presents all its information in color [[ASCII]] characters. Gameplay centers on two main activities: navigation and combat. Navigation takes place on the Main Computer [[graphical user interface|GUI]]. It consists of a main [[star chart]] map, the player's current position, and visual displays. Other information may be accessed using the appropriate commands. Navigation may be conducted manually or automatically.<ref name="moby" />

Each area, or quadrant, on the map is displayed as a series of numbers representing [[asteroid]]s, [[starbase]]s, and enemy ships present. The ship's long-range sensors can detect entities in adjacent quadrants, while short-range sensors detect items in the current quadrant. The ship also has a limited number of [[Uncrewed spacecraft|probes]] for very long-range exploration.<ref name="moby" />

Combat is the primary activity of ''Star Fleet I'', and is initiated whenever the player's starship enters a hostile area. Each quadrant may contain a number of starbases, [[space marines]], and Krellan (maximum of five) or Zaldron (often just one) enemy ships. The player may find hostile quadrants by chance or may be summoned by a starbase under attack.<ref name="moby" />

Enemies automatically engage the player's ship with [[List of weapons in Star Trek#Phasers|phaser]]s. While the player's ship outmatches Krellan starships, several enemy starships can prove dangerous. Zaldron ships may also be present but [[cloaking device|cloaked]]. The Zaldron ships must de-cloak before engaging the player, also using phasers as a primary weapon.<ref name="moby" />

The player may either destroy or disable enemy starships. Disabled starships can then be captured and [[Tractor beam|tractored]] to friendly starbases.<ref name="moby" />

The player has a lethal arsenal at their disposal with which to engage the enemy: phasers, [[List of weapons in Star Trek#Photon torpedoes|torpedoes]], and [[List of weapons in Star Trek#Multikinetic neutronic mines|mines]]. Torpedoes destroy enemy ships (provided they strike the target), while the other weapons may disable (or ultimately destroy) enemy ships. When disabled, a ship may be captured by ordering space marines to board the vessel, and automatic combat between the enemy's crew and the marines will then ensue. If victorious, the player receives some power and a number of prisoners. The captured ship may then be towed to a starbase.<ref name="moby" />

However, during capture attempts, enemy spies or prisoners may escape on the player's ship undetected and disable vital systems. Such situations result in an "Intruder Alert", forcing the player to search for the culprit.<ref name="moby" />

As a last resort, the player may to choose to self-destruct his ship, which will adversely affect the game's final score.<ref name="moby" />

After completing a mission, the player is rated on several factors, including number of enemies eliminated or captured and starbases rescued. Successful missions may result in promotions or commendations.<ref name="moby" />
