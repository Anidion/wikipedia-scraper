==Reception==
Earl Buckelew wrote in ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'': "while it's designed with younger players in mind, ''Stocker'' has enough thrills to provide the rest of us with hours of fun. With skill and determination, you may even see the checkered flag in California."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/1989-03-computegazette/page/n25/mode/2up|title=Compute! Gazette Issue 69|date=March 22, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Bill Kunkel for ''[[Ahoy!]]'' wrote, "''Stocker'' is a quaint game, almost like an antique that's been painfully restored using state-of-the-art techniques."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/ahoy-magazine-60/page/n51/mode/2up|title=Ahoy! Magazine Issue 60|date=December 22, 1988|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Paul A. Hughes for ''[[.info (magazine)|Info]]'' wrote, "The whole game is simple, including the graphics, sound, and game play. You will probably play this game a few times and then put it away."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Info_Issue_23_1988-11_Info_Publications_US/page/n77/mode/2up|title=Info - Issue 23 (1988-11)(Info Publications)(US)|date=November 25, 1988|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Scott Wasser for ''[[Run (magazine)|Run]]'' magazine wrote, "at home, where only boredom limits the number of times a game can be played, Stocker reaches that limit fairly quickly. So, unless you're someone who couldn't get enough of Stocker in the arcades, I'd recommend you save your software quarters for something else."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/run-magazine-61/page/n27/mode/2up|title=Run Magazine Issue 61|date=January 25, 1989|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>
