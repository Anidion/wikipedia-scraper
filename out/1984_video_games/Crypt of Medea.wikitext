'''Crypt of Medea''' is an [[Adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]] written by Arthur Britto and Allan Lamb.  It was published for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] by [[Sir-Tech]] in 1984. ''Crypt of Medea'' makes use of graphics, but the game is still controlled through the use of text commands in the traditional style of [[interactive fiction]] games.

The game begins with the player trapped inside [[Medea|Medea's]] crypt, and the goal is to find a way out.  To do so, the player must make use of a variety of items and avoid falling victim to a number of enemies and traps.

==Plot==
After falling unconscious during a late night drive, the unnamed [[protagonist]] wakes up in an unfamiliar tomb.<ref name="cgw">Reams, 1984, p. 35</ref>  This tomb is the crypt of [[Medea]], and it is filled with hostile creatures and deadly traps.  The protagonist is forced to explore the crypt in hopes of escaping.

Very little plot is made available to the player during the course of the game.  No information is given about how the player ended up in Medea's tomb, and no background information is ever given about Medea.  In fact, the protagonist does not ever encounter Medea during the course of the game, and the only mention of her is through an inscription that she wrote.<ref>'''Inscription:''' MANY HAVE TRIED AND MANY HAVE FAILED.  BECAUSE YOU LACK STRENGTH, YOU HAVE FAILED ME ALSO!  YOU ARE NOT WORTHY OF ME. . . OR YOUR LIFE!  IT IS SIGNED. . .MEDEA!' (''Crypt of Medea'')</ref>

==Gameplay==
The game's environment is divided into a series of distinct sections.  Each section is represented with a picture and a text description.  Objects or creatures that the player can interact with will be visible in the picture and described in the text description.  The player can move from one section to another by moving in one of the [[cardinal direction]]s or occasionally through other actions (such as going up a staircase, going down a hole, or swinging across a ravine).

One of the primary gameplay mechanics in ''Crypt of Medea'' is the use of items.  Items can be found in many locations throughout the crypt, and the player can carry a limited number of these items at any given time.  Often one or more items are the key to solving a puzzle or defeating an enemy that blocks the player's progress.  Since the player can only hold a few items at once, inventory management is often a crucial factor to the player's survival.

==Reception==
At the time of its release, ''Crypt of Medea'' was considered a fairly graphic and adult game due to its detailed descriptions of violent deaths.  Kim Schuette, author of [[The Book of Adventure Games]], described ''Crypt of Medea'' as "a humorless and gruesome game, full of blood, gore, and little else."<ref>[http://www.if-legends.org/~yois/column.php?column_date=2001-09-10 Schuette, 1984 as cited in]</ref>  The cover of the game even describes ''Crypt of Medea'' as "an adventure game for the very mature and strong of heart."

''Computer Gaming World'' described ''Crypt of Medea'' as "an example of a mature and excellent product" and an "excellently designed game." The magazine praised the game for its controls and for having a level of challenge that is enjoyable for both novice and expert players.<ref name="cgw"/> ''[[St.Game]]'' described the game as "something of an [[Addams Family]] on disk. It is macabre and witty and stupid and inventive and repetitious and altogether kooky". The magazine criticized the game's typos and poor parser, but stated that it was "full of funny surprises", and recommended it to "beginning adventurers in the family".<ref name="zilbert19840304">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&pub=6&id=16 | title=Crypt of Medea | work=St.Game | date=Marâ€“Apr 1984 | access-date=29 July 2014 | author=Zilbert, Todd | pages=53}}</ref>
