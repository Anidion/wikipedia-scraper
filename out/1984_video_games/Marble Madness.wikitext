'''''Marble Madness''''' is an [[arcade video game]] designed by [[Mark Cerny]] and published by [[Atari Games]] in 1984. It is a [[platform game]] in which the player must guide a marble through six courses, populated with obstacles and enemies, within a time limit. The player controls the marble by using a [[trackball]]. ''Marble Madness'' is known for using innovative game technologies: it was Atari's first to use the [[Atari System 1]] hardware, the first to be programmed in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], and one of the first to use true [[stereophonic sound|stereo sound]] (previous games used either [[monaural]] sound or [[Duophonic|simulated stereo]]).

In designing the game, Cerny drew inspiration from [[miniature golf]], [[Racing video game|racing game]]s, and artwork by [[M. C. Escher]]. He aimed to create a game that offered a distinct experience with a unique control system. Cerny applied a [[Minimalism|minimalist]] approach in designing the appearance of the game's courses and enemies. Throughout development, he was frequently impeded by limitations in technology and had to forgo several design ideas.

Upon its release in arcades, ''Marble Madness'' was commercially successful and profitable. Critics praised the game's difficulty, unique visual design, and stereo soundtrack. The game was ported to numerous platforms and inspired the development of other games. A sequel was developed and planned for release in 1991, but canceled when location testing showed the game could not succeed in competition with other titles.

==Gameplay==
[[File:marblemadnessscreenshot.png|thumb|left|alt=Horizontal rectangular video game screenshot of the arcade version that is a digital representation of a grided plane with ramps and spikes. A blue marble is near the center of the screen, with moving green tubes below it.|The blue, player-controlled marble (center left) traverses an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] course. Scores and available time are tracked at the top of the screen.]]
''Marble Madness'' is an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric]] [[platform game]] in which the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective. In the arcade version, a player controls the marble's movements with a [[trackball]]; most home versions use [[game controller]]s with [[D-pad|directional pads]]. The player's goal is to complete six maze-like isometric race courses before a set amount of time expires. With the exception of the first race, any time left on the clock at the end of a race is carried over to the next one, and the player is granted a set amount of additional time as well. The game allows two players to compete against each other, awarding bonus points and extra time to the winner of each race; both players have separate clocks.<ref name="Fever"/><ref name="Retro"/><ref name="GameTrailers"/><ref name="NP-1989"/>

Courses are populated with various objects and enemies designed to obstruct the player, as well as track surfaces that make control of the marble more difficult. As the game progresses, the courses become increasingly difficult and introduce more enemies and obstacles. Each course has a distinct visual theme. For example, the first race (titled "Practice") is a simple course that is much shorter than the others, while the fifth race (named "Silly") features polka-dot patterns and is oriented in a direction opposite that of the other courses.<ref name="Fever"/><ref name="Retro"/><ref name="GameTrailers"/><ref name="NP-1989"/>

==Development==
''Marble Madness'' was developed by [[Atari Games]], with [[Mark Cerny]] as the lead designer and Bob Flanagan as the software engineer.<ref name="RG-67"/> Both Cerny and Flanagan handled programming the game.<ref name="Retro"/> It uses the [[Atari System 1]] hardware, which was an interchangeable system of circuit boards, control panels, and artwork.<ref name="PriceGuide-1"/> The game features [[raster graphics|pixel graphics]] on a 19-inch [[Electrohome]] G07 model [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT monitor]] and uses a [[Motorola 68010]] [[central processing unit]] (CPU) with a [[MOS Technology 6502]] subsystem to control the audio and coin operations.<ref name="klov"/> ''Marble Madness'' was the very first arcade game to use an [[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM]] [[sound chip]] produced by [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], similar to a [[Yamaha DX7]] [[synthesizer]], which created the music in real time so that it was in [[synchronization]] with the game's on-screen action.<ref name="Retro"/><ref name="ArtOfGameWorlds"/> The game's music was composed by [[Brad Fuller (composer)|Brad Fuller]] and Hal Canon who spent a few months becoming familiar with the sound chip's capabilities.<ref name="Retro"/>

Cerny and Flanagan first collaborated on a video game based on [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's ''Thriller'']]. The project was canceled and the two began working on an idea of Cerny's that eventually became ''Marble Madness''. Development lasted {{Nowrap|10 months}}.<ref name="RG-67"/> Following the [[video game crash of 1983]], game development within Atari focused on providing a distinctive experience through the use of a unique control system and by emphasizing a [[Multiplayer video game|simultaneous two-player]] mode. Cerny designed ''Marble Madness'' in accordance with these company goals. He was first inspired by [[miniature golf]] and captivated by the idea that a playfield's contours influenced a ball's path. Cerny began testing various ideas using Atari's digital art system. After deciding to use an isometric grid, Cerny began developing the game's concept. His initial idea involved hitting a ball in a way similar to miniature golf, but Atari was unenthusiastic. Cerny next thought of [[Racing video game|racing game]]s and planned for races on long tracks against an opponent. Technology limitations at the time were unable to handle the in-game physics necessary for the idea, and Cerny switched the game's objective to a race against time.<ref name="Retro"/>

The development toolkit for the Motorola CPU included a [[compiler]] for the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], which the two programmers were familiar with. After Atari had conducted performance evaluations, it approved usage of the language.<ref name="RG-67"/> Cerny and Flanagan's decision to program ''Marble Madness'' in the C language had positive and negative consequences. Atari games had previously been programmed in [[assembly language]]. The C language was easier to program, but was less efficient, so the game operates at the slower speed of {{Nowrap|30 [[Hertz|Hz]]}} instead of the normal {{Nowrap|60 Hz}} frequency of arcade games at the time. Cerny decided to use a trackball system (marketed by Atari as Trak-Ball) to give the game a unique control system, and he chose a motorized trackball for faster spinning and braking when the in-game ball traveled downhill and uphill, respectively. As it was building the prototypes, Atari's design department informed Cerny that the motorized trackball's design had an inherent flaw—one of the four supports had poor contact with the ball—and the use of a regular trackball was more feasible. Additionally, Cerny had anticipated the use of powerful custom chips that would allow [[Random-access memory|RAM]]-based [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] to be animated by the CPU, but the available hardware was a less advanced system using [[Read-only memory|ROM]]-based static sprites.<ref name="Retro"/>

[[File:MarbleMadness-diagrams.jpg|thumb|alt=A group of four boxes with a hand-drawn diagram and text description in each box.|Concepts for ''Marble Madness'' were outlined in an extensive design document. The document contains a number of ideas, like the tilting ramp and see-saw scale above, that were not used in the final product.]]

These technical limitations forced Cerny to simplify the overall designs. Inspired by [[M. C. Escher]], he designed abstract landscapes for the courses. In retrospect, Cerny partly attributed the designs to his limited artistic skills.<ref name="Retro"/> He was a fan of the [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] used in ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' and ''[[I, Robot (video game)|I, Robot]]'', but felt that the visuals lacked definition and wanted to create a game with "solid and clean" 3D graphics.<ref name="GDC2011"/> Unlike most other arcade games of the time, the course images were not drawn on the [[pixel]] level. Instead, Cerny defined the elevation of every point in the course and stored this information in a [[heightmap]] array. The course graphics were then created by a [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] program that traced the path of light rays, using the heightmap to determine the appearance of the course on screen. This format also allowed Cerny to create shadows and use [[spatial anti-aliasing]], a technique that provided the graphics with a smoother appearance. Cerny's course generator allowed him more time to experiment with the level designs. When deciding what elements to include in a course, practicality was a big factor; elements that would not work or would not appear as intended were omitted, such as an elastic barricade or a teeter-totter scale.<ref name="Retro"/> Other ideas dropped from the designs were breakable glass supports, black hole traps, and bumps and obstacles built into the course that chased the marble.<ref name="GDC2011"/>

Cerny's personal interests changed throughout the project, leading to the inclusion of new ideas absent from the original design documents. The game's enemy characters were designed by Cerny and Sam Comstock, who also animated them. Enemies had to be small in size due to technical limitations. Cerny and Comstock purposely omitted faces to give them unique designs and create a minimalistic appearance similar to the courses.<ref name="Retro"/> Atari's management, however, suggested that the marble should have a smiley face to create an identified character, similar to [[Pac-Man]]. As a compromise, the cabinet's artwork depicts traces of a smiley face on the marbles.<ref name="GDC2011"/> Flanagan programmed a three-dimensional [[Computer simulation|physics model]] to dictate the marble's motions and an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] script for enemy behavior.<ref name="RG-67"/> As ''Marble Madness'' neared completion, the feedback from Atari's in-house [[Focus group|focus testing]] was positive. In retrospect, Cerny wished he had included more courses to give the game greater longevity, but extra courses would have required more time and increased hardware costs. Atari was experiencing severe financial troubles at the time and could not extend the game's development period as it would have left their production factory idle.<ref name="Retro"/>

==Reception==
''Marble Madness'' was commercially successful following its December 1984 release and was positively received by critics.<ref name="Retro"/><ref name="GDC2011"/><ref name="BetaBlues"/> Around {{nowrap|4,000 cabinets}} were sold, and it soon became the highest-earning game in arcades. However, the game consistently fell from this ranking during its seventh week in arcades where Atari tracked the game's success.<ref name="Retro"/><ref name="GDC2011"/> Cerny attributed the six-week arcade life to ''Marble Madness''{{'}}s short gameplay length.<ref name="GDC2011"/> He believed that players lost interest after mastering it and moved on to other games.<ref name="Retro"/> In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Marble Madness'' on their May 1, 1985 issue as being the second most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=259|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=May 1, 1985|page=21|lang=ja}}</ref>

Many reviewers felt that the high level of skill required to play the game was part of its appeal.<ref name="GameTrailers"/><ref name="Dream"/> In 2008, Levi Buchanan of ''[[IGN]]'' listed ''Marble Madness'' as one of several titles in his "dream arcade", citing the game's difficulty and the fond memories he had playing it.<ref name="Dream"/> Author John Sellers wrote that difficulty was a major reason that players were attracted. Other engaging factors included the graphics, visual design and the soundtrack.<ref name="Fever"/> ''[[Retro Gamer]]''{{'}}s Craig Grannell, in referring to the game as one of the most distinctive arcade games ever made, praised its visuals as "pure and timeless".<ref name="Retro"/> In 1995, ''[[Flux (magazine)|Flux]]'' rated the game ninety-ninth on its "Top 100 Video Games".<ref>{{Cite journal |date=April 1995 |title=Top 100 Video Games |url=https://archive.org/details/flux-issue-4/page/n31/mode/2up |journal=Flux |issue=4 |pages=32}}</ref> In 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' ranked the arcade version of ''Marble Madness'' as 15 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time".<ref name="NG-Top100">{{cite magazine|date=September 1996|title=Top 100 Games of All Time|url=https://archive.org/details/nextgen-issue-021/page/n69/mode/2up|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|issue=21|page=66}}</ref> In 1997 ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' listed it as the 10th best arcade game of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The 10 Best Arcade Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=130}}</ref> In 2003, ''Marble Madness'' was inducted into ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s list of the greatest games of all time.<ref name="Gamespot">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-29.html|title=The Greatest Games of All Time: ''Marble Madness''|website=[[GameSpot]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709103724/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-29.html| archive-date=July 9, 2007}}</ref> In 2008, ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' listed it as the number seventy-nine arcade game in technical, creative and cultural impact.<ref name="GWR08"/> ''Marble Madness'' was one of the first games to use true [[Stereophonic sound|stereo sound]] and have a recognizable musical score.<ref name="GameTrailers"/><ref name="ArtOfGameWorlds"/> British composer Paul Weir commented that the music had character and helped give the game a unique identity.<ref name="ArtOfGameWorlds"/> A common complaint about the arcade cabinet was that the track ball controls frequently broke from repeated use.<ref name="Dream"/><ref name="20AtariGames"/>

===Home versions===
The different ports were met with mixed reception. John Harris of ''[[Gamasutra]]'' thought the arcade's popularity fueled the sales of the home versions, while Thomas Hanley of [[ScrewAttack]] commented that most versions were not as enjoyable without a track ball.<ref name="GameTrailers"/> Grannell echoed similar statements about the controls and added that many had poor visuals and [[collision detection]]. He listed the [[Amiga]], [[Game Boy]] and [[Sega Genesis]] ports as the better conversions, and the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s and [[Game Boy Advance]] versions among the worst.<ref name="Retro"/> ''[[MegaTech]]'' reviewers rated the Sega Genesis release favorably.<ref name="MegaTech"/> ''Next Generation'' staff also liked the Sega Genesis version, but noted that the experience is better when playing with the original trackball controls.<ref name="NG-Top100"/>

''[[Compute!]]'' writers called the Amiga version's graphics and gameplay "arcade-quality".<ref name="bateman198610">{{cite news|author=Bateman, Selby|url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-10-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_077_1986_Oct#page/n19/mode/2up|title=A Great Year For Games|date=October 1986|work=Compute!|access-date=November 9, 2013|issue=77|pages=18}}</ref> Reviewing for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', Roy Wagner stated that the Amiga version was superior to the arcade original.<ref name="wagner198611">{{cite news|author=Wagner, Roy|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_32/page/n37/mode/2up|title=Amiga Preferences|date=November 1986|magazine=Computer Gaming World|issue=32|pages=38}}</ref> [[Bruce Webster]] of ''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' wrote that the graphics of the Amiga version of ''Marble Madness'' in December 1986 "are really amazing".

==Legacy==
''Marble Madness'' inspired other games which involve navigating a ball through progressively more difficult courses.<ref name="Retro"/><ref name="GWR08"/><ref name="20AtariGames"/> [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House's]] ''[[Gyroscope (video game)|Gyroscope]]'' and [[Electric Dreams Software]]'s ''[[Spindizzy (video game)|Spindizzy]]'' were the first such games; both met with a good reception.<ref name="Retro"/><ref name="YS-1"/><ref name="YS-7"/> In 1990, Rare released ''[[Snake Rattle 'n' Roll]]'', which incorporated elements similar to ''Marble Madness''.<ref name="RareHistory"/> The ''[[Super Monkey Ball]]'' series uses similar gameplay based on rolling a ball, but adds other features such as [[minigame]]s and monkey characters.<ref name="Retro"/><ref name="20AtariGames"/>

===Unreleased sequel===
An arcade sequel titled ''Marble Man: Marble Madness II'' was planned for release in 1991, though Cerny was uninvolved in the development.<ref name="Retro"/><ref name="BetaBlues"/> Development was led by Bob Flanagan who designed the game based on what he felt made ''Marble Madness'' a success in the home console market. Because the market's demographic was a younger audience, Flanagan wanted to make the sequel more accessible and introduced a superhero-type main character. ''Marble Man'' expanded on the gameplay of the original game with new abilities for the marble such as invisibility and flight, added pinball minigames between sets of levels, and allowed up to three players to traverse isometric courses. Flanagan intended to address the short length of the first game and, with the help of Mike Hally, developed seventeen courses.<ref name="Retro-55"/>

Atari created prototypes for location testing, but the game did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as ''[[Street Fighter II]]''. Atari assumed the trackballs accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls. Because the new models were met with the same poor reception, production was halted and the focus shifted to ''[[Guardians of the 'Hood]]'', a [[beat 'em up]] game.<ref name="BetaBlues"/><ref name="MM2"/> [[Arcade system board]]s for the sequel were rumored to have been destroyed to clear inventory for tax purposes in 1996, but Cerny has called the destruction an urban legend, indicating that at most 12 prototypes' boards were produced.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=February 1997|title=Williams 'Cements' Reputation as Ball Breaker|url=https://archive.org/details/nextgen-issue-26/page/n43/mode/2up|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|issue=26|page=43}}</ref> These prototypes have since become [[Collectable|collector items]].<ref name="PriceGuide-3"/> In 2022, a prototype of the joystick-controlled version of ''Marble Madness II'' was leaked online.<ref>{{cite web|last=Orland|first=Kyle|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/after-30-years-the-world-can-now-play-the-lost-marble-madness-ii/|title=After 30 years, the world can now play the lost Marble Madness II|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=May 26, 2022|access-date=2022-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220526173831/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/after-30-years-the-world-can-now-play-the-lost-marble-madness-ii/|archive-date=2022-05-26|url-status=live}}</ref>
