'''''Spy Hunter''''' is a [[vehicular combat game|vehicular combat game]] developed by [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]] and released for [[Arcade video game|arcades]] in 1984.<ref name="CB"/><ref name="Akagi"/> The game draws inspiration from the [[James Bond films]] and was originally supposed to carry the [[James Bond games|James Bond]] brand. The object of the game is to drive down roads in the technologically advanced "Interceptor" car and destroy various enemy vehicles with a variety of onboard weapons. ''Spy Hunter'' was produced in both sit-down and standard upright versions with the latter being more common.<ref name="Spy Hunter">{{cite web |url =http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9742 |title =Spy Hunter |publisher =The International Arcade Museum |access-date =4 October 2013}}</ref> The game's controls consist of a [[steering wheel]] in the form of a futuristic aircraft-style yoke with several special-purpose buttons, a two-position [[Manual transmission|stick shift]] (offering 'low' and 'high' gears), and a pedal used for acceleration.

''Spy Hunter'' was a commercial success in American arcades, where it was one of the top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1984 and 1985. It was ported to the [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II]], [[ColecoVision]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], and [[BBC Micro]]. ''Spy Hunter'' was followed by ''[[Spy Hunter II]]'', which added a 3D view and two-player split-screen play, a pinball tie-in, and a successor series of games bearing the ''Spy Hunter'' name. In addition, the NES received a sequel titled '''''Super Spy Hunter'''''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Spy Hunter.png|thumb|left|The player has shot an innocent civilian car and is penalized with no points for a short duration.]]
''Spy Hunter'' is a [[Scrolling#Video games|vertical scrolling]] [[Racing game|driving]] game with the player in the role of a spy driving an armed sportscar. The object of the game is to travel the freeway destroying as many enemy vehicles as possible while protecting civilian vehicles. The game uses a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]]. Controls consist of a two-position gearshift lever, a floor-mounted accelerator pedal, and a steering yoke with five buttons, and the cabinet also includes a dashboard with status lights.

The game begins with the player driving the fictitious G-6155 Interceptor, using the yoke, pedal, and gearshift to steer and control speed. The car is equipped with a machine gun that has unlimited ammunition and can be fired by pressing and holding the corresponding button on the yoke. 

Various enemy vehicles try to destroy the player's car or force it off the road, including a helicopter that drops bombs from overhead. A counter increments the [[point (gaming)|score]] while the car is moving and on the road. Additional points are earned by destroying enemy vehicles using weapons or forcing them off the road. After an initial lead-in time during which the player has an unlimited supply of cars, the player must earn extra cars by reaching score thresholds. Destroying non-enemy cars halts the score counter for a short while, and no points are scored whenever the player's car is off the road. The car can be destroyed by a hard collision with another vehicle, if it is hit by an enemy weapon (including the craters blasted into the road by the helicopter's bombs), or by running far enough off the roadway (or waterway).

Following periodic forks in the road, the player can enter new regions with different terrain or weather conditions. The player can also acquire special weapons by entering a weapons van, which appears in each new territory and can be periodically summoned by pressing its button on the yoke when its dashboard light is flashing. Available special weapons consist of [[oil slick]]s, [[smoke screen]]s, and [[surface-to-air missile]]s; each is controlled by a different button, and the dashboard lights indicate which ones are available at any given time. Special weapons have a limited ammunition supply and are lost whenever the player's car is destroyed.

At certain points, the player will have the option to convert the car into a [[speedboat]] for a brief time by driving through a boathouse; at others, the player will be forced to make the transition. Enemy boats can attack from in front or behind, and the helicopter can drop bombs from above. While in speedboat mode, the oil slick becomes a [[flamethrower]], while the smoke screen and missiles remain unchanged. 

The game has no ending, and play continues until the player has lost all cars.<ref name=Ellis />

==Development==
Game designer [[George Gomez]] drew inspiration for the game from listening to an [[audio cassette tape]] of music from [[James Bond films]]. He designed the game with Tom Leon, with whom he had worked on ''[[Tron (video game)|Tron]]''. Gomez sketched out the in-game road map on a long scroll of drawing paper and also came up with the idea of the weapons van. Originally the game was to be based directly on James Bond and have the "[[James Bond Theme]]" as in-game music, but the license could not be acquired. Instead, an electronic arrangement of [[Henry Mancini]]'s [[Peter Gunn (song)|theme to ''Peter Gunn'']] plays throughout.<ref name=Ellis>{{cite web|url=http://www.liketotally80s.com/2012/10/spy-hunter/|title=Chat with Spy Hunter Game Designer|author=Dave Ellis|date=October 2, 2012|publisher=Like Totally 80s}}</ref>

[[File:Spy Hunter ZX Spectrum.png|thumb|ZX Spectrum version]]

A pinball table based on ''Spy Hunter'' was released in 1984 by [[Bally Technologies|Bally]].

The arcade game was ported to the ColecoVision in January 1985.<ref name="CE1985">{{cite magazine |title=1985 Index |magazine=[[Computer Entertainer]] |date=January 1986 |volume=4 |issue=10 |page=6 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/newsletters/video_game_update/computer_entertainer_jan86.pdf#page=6}}</ref>

The original ''Spy Hunter'' was followed by an arcade sequel, ''[[Spy Hunter II]]'' in 1987. It retained the "Peter Gunn" music and incorporated a cooperative two-player mode, but the top-down view was replaced with a perspective from behind and above the car.

After Japanese video game developer [[Sunsoft]] ported ''Spy Hunter'' to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the company created ''Battle Formula'' with similar gameplay. Sunsoft America signed a deal with Bally Midway to release it outside Japan as '''''Super Spy Hunter'''''.

The series was reprised in 2001 with ''[[SpyHunter]]'' developed by [[Paradigm Entertainment]] and published by [[Midway Games]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[Game Boy Advance]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].

In the summer of 2003, [[Universal Pictures]] acquired the rights to the arcade game ''Spy Hunter'' from [[Midway Games]]. The following September, Universal signed actor [[Dwayne Johnson|Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]] to star in the film adaptation based on the game. Screenwriters [[Michael Brandt]] and [[Derek Haas]] were hired to write the screenplay, though a director had not been decided at the time.
