'''''Turmoil''''' is a [[platform game]] released in [[1984 in video gaming|1984]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], and in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]] for the [[MSX]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generation-msx.nl/msxdb/softwareinfo/2682|title=Turmoil (1985, MSX, Bug-Byte Software) &#124; Generation MSX}}</ref> by [[Bug Byte]]. The player takes control of Mechanic Mick who has been employed by a rich Arabian [[Sheikh]]. The Sheikh has refused to pay Mick for work done, so Mick decides to steal his collection of expensive cars in lieu of payment. He must build the cars by collecting oil from a dripping oil tank. The oil can also be used as an offensive weapon against the pursuing Arabian guards.<ref name="SP_Preview">{{Citation|last=Mortimer|first=June|title=Soft Spot: Turmoil|newspaper=[[Sinclair Programs]]|date=January 1985}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==

The playing area consists of a number of platforms, ladders, conveyor belts and swinging ropes which Mick must negotiate. First he must collect an oil can, which he must take to a tap which is dripping oil. The oil that has been collected must be taken to the garage. Once there Mick can empty his can, a drop at a time, to fill his car. The car is invisible initially, and is built up as each drop of oil is deposited. On the first level the car is a [[Mini]], but as on subsequent levels the cars become more sleek and expensive.<ref name="CRASH_Review">{{Citation|title=Turmoil Review|newspaper=[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]|date=December 1984}}</ref>

Also present on each level are a number of enemies (resembling Arabs) who will attack Mick and cause him to lose a life. Unlike other platform games, the main character cannot jump by himself, but must fall onto one of the springs which are present on each level to bounce to a different platform. The Arabs will also make use of the ladders, ropes and springs.<ref name="YS_Review">{{Citation|last=Nicholls|first=Dave|last2=Willis|first2=Roger|title=Turmoil Review|newspaper=[[Your Spectrum]]|date=February 1985}}</ref>
