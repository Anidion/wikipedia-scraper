'''''Blue Max 2001''''' is a diagonally-scrolling shooter written by Bob Polin (also credited as Rob Polin) for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published by [[Synapse Software]] in 1984. A [[Commodore 64]] version was released the same year. ''Blue Max 2001'' is the sequel to 1983's ''[[Blue Max (video game)|Blue Max]]'', also by Polin, with the player piloting a futuristic [[hovercraft]] instead of a World War I [[biplane]].<ref name=manual/> Critics found the game disappointing compared with the original, citing the indistinct graphics and confusing documentation.

==Reception==
In contrast to the positive reception given to ''Blue Max'', reviews of ''Blue Max 2001'' on both Atari and Commodore systems were mixed.

''[[Ahoy!]]'' called the Commodore 64 release an "exciting sequel" which "extends and refines the elements which made the original game popular, while it introduces enough new challenges to generate fresh excitement."<ref name="katz198506">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_18_1985-06_Ion_International_US#page/n61/mode/2up | title=Blue Max 2001 | work=Ahoy! | date=June 1985 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Katz, Arnie | pages=63, 66}}</ref> ''[[Zzap!64]]'' labeled it "one of the most disappointing sequels of all time". Reviewer [[Julian Rignall]] wrote, "The graphics are very poor", citing the "[[Gelatin dessert|jelly]] mould" ship and "wonky" perspective. He mentioned the difficulty caused by use of the joystick diagonals.<ref name='zzap64' />

Atari magazine ''[[Page 6]]'' also considered it a "disappointment" compared to its predecessor, remarking that the [[Polo (confectionery)|Polo mint]] ship is "a nightmare to fly, far less operate the bombs and lasers, with any degree of accuracy."<ref name="page6" /> Bill Kunkel wrote  in an ''Atari Explorer'' review, "this game is plagued with ridiculous terminology and some of the shoddiest documentation since the days when computer software was sold in baggies."<ref name="kunkel">{{cite journal |last1=Kunkel |first1=Bill |title=Reviews: Blue Max 2001 |journal=Atari Explorer |date=June 1985 |page=44 |url=https://archive.org/details/Atari_Explorer_1985-06_Atari_US/page/n45?q=%22blue+max+2001%22}}</ref> ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' found the Atari version had "fairly good graphics with some interesting touches, but the manual is a poor introduction to the game:

{{blockquote|text=The documentation, unfortunately, appears to have been written in some other language and translated three or four times by volunteers. This means that the first half hour of play can be quite frustrating as you try to figure out exactly what is going on.
