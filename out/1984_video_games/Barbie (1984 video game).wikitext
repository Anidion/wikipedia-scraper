==Reception==

Reviewing the game for ''[[Run (magazine)|Run Magazine]]'', Marilyn Annucci gave it a score of C (the middle of 5 possible scores, which the magazine describes as "Good"), complimenting its detailed graphics and "unusually realistic sound", she was highly critical of the programs "many sexist elements" including how much of the game was built around playing to the whims of [[Ken (doll)|Ken]]. She also thought that children would quickly tire of the "unimpressive" gameplay.<ref name="RUN" />
