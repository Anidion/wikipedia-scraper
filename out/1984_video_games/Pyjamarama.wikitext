'''''Pyjamarama''''' is a [[video game]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and the [[Commodore 64]]. It features Wally Week as the central character and is the second (after ''Automania'') of a series of games featuring Wally and/or members of his family. It was published by [[Mikro-Gen]] (through [[Amsoft]] for the Amstrad version). Starting in July 1986, ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' magazine published a monthly comic strip based on the character.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/WallyMonthly-7-1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616003256/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/WallyMonthly-7-1.htm |archivedate=16 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

There are two different versions of the game. The original plays the song "[[Popcorn (instrumental)|Popcorn]]", the second release plays an original tune.

Four other Wally Week games were released: ''Automania'', ''[[Everyone's A Wally]]'', ''Herbert's Dummy Run'', and ''[[Three Weeks in Paradise]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Pyjamarama'' is an [[action-adventure game]] set across several interconnecting rooms. The player takes the role of Wally, who has gone to bed for the night and has to wake up early in the morning for work. Unfortunately, his [[alarm clock]] has not been wound, and thus he will sleep late in the morning, and his boss will fire him. However, in his sleep, Wally's [[consciousness]] travels around his home, and other places, wearing his [[pajamas|pyjamas]], in search for the key to rewind the alarm clock and wake himself up.

The game is made up of [[Flip-screen|static single-screen]] rooms, each of which can include platforms in various arrangements, objects to pick up, and enemies to avoid. Wally can walk through the screens to progress through the game's map and to pick up objects. Wally can carry two items in a [[fIFO (computing and electronics)|first in, first out]] arrangement. Contact with an enemy drains Wally's "snooze energy", and if it runs out, Wally loses one of his lives. Snooze energy can be regained by drinking milk, which appears at various locations in the game.  When all lives are lost, Wally returns to sleep and does not wake up until late in the morning, losing the game.

One of the rooms in the game is a video games room, in which Wally can play a version of [[Space Invaders]] against various sprites from other parts of the game.  If all the rounds are completed, Wally is rewarded with an extra life.

''Pyjamarama'' can be played either with a [[joystick]] or with the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]. There are three controls: walk left, walk right, and jump.

==Reception==
The ZX Spectrum version of ''Pyjamarama'' received the Game of the Month award in the November 1984 issue of ''[[Personal Computer Games]]'', beating the [[BBC Micro]] version of ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' to the title.
