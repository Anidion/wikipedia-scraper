{{nihongo foot|'''''Chack'n Pop'''''|ちゃっくんぽっぷ|Chakkun Poppu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[Platform game|platform]] [[arcade game]] developed and released by [[Taito]] in 1984. In the game, the player controls a small yellow creature, Chack'n, with the objective being to retrieve hearts from a cave, all while avoiding the enemies contained within them. Chack'n also has the ability to deploy bombs, which can kill said enemies, which can bring bonuses depending on if all or none of the enemies have been killed.

It is considered to be a spiritual predecessor of ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'' due to the shared characters and similar game structure. Home ports were released for the [[SG-1000]], [[MSX]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]], [[Sharp X1]], [[NEC PC-6001]] and [[NEC PC-8801]]. The arcade version would later be included via emulation in ''[[Taito Legends Power-Up]]'', ''[[Taito Memories|Taito Memories Pocket]]'', ''[[Taito Memories|Taito Memories Gekan]]'', and ''[[Taito Legends 2]]''. The Family Computer version would later be re-released on the [[Wii|Nintendo Wii]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] via [[Virtual Console]].

==Reception==
Sakô felt the game flopped in Japanese arcades due to its difficulty.<ref name=":4" /> However, the home ports, specifically the Family Computer and MSX versions of the game, sold much better and became one of Taito's "top IPs".<ref name=":4" />

Retrospective views on ''Chack'n Pop'' have been mostly negative. A mini review of the game on a retrospective of ''[[The NewZealand Story]]'' found in an issue of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' claimed the game "wasn't a great platformer" due to how complex it is.<ref name=":2" /> ''[[PC Zone]]'' said the game "isn't much fun", despite the ideas it presented for the time, and the fact that it was ''Bubble Bobble''<nowiki/>'s predecessor.<ref name=":0" /> Rhody Tobin of ''HonestGamers'' slammed the Family Computer version of the game for its controls, gameplay, and presentation, and while admitting that the game is "vaguely interesting", ended that it is "best forgotten".<ref name=":3" /> A more positive review of the game came from Alex Kidman of ''[[Kotaku Australia]]'', where he briefly reviewed the Family Computer version of the game, and while he recommended it for fans of ''Bubble Bobble'', he noted that it is a very different game compared to ''Bubble Bobble''.<ref name=":1" />

==Legacy==
''Chack'n Pop'' is often considered to be one of the spiritual predecessors to ''Bubble Bobble'', mostly due to the similar gameplay structure and shared characters.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tursi|first=Lee|date=15 December 2019|title=Fairyland Story, The|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/fairyland-story-the/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216051225/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/fairyland-story-the/|archive-date=16 December 2019|access-date=4 October 2020|website=Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Harris|first=John|date=9 April 2019|title=Exploring the secret depths of Bubble Bobble 's design|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/340040/Exploring_the_secret_depths_of_Bubble_Bobbles_design.php|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603064138/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/340040/Exploring_the_secret_depths_of_Bubble_Bobbles_design.php|archive-date=3 June 2020|access-date=21 April 2020|website=[[Gamasutra]]|language=en}}</ref> The Monstas and Mightas would later appear as common enemies in ''Bubble Bobble''.<ref name=":1" /> Chack'n and other characters from ''Chack'n Pop'' has appeared in various other Taito games as cameos, such as ''[[Ben Bero Beh]]'', ''Bubble Bobble'', ''[[Bubble Memories]]'', and ''NY Captor''.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Bubble Trouble|url=https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue006-010/Retro_Gamer_Issue_008|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|volume=8|pages=41|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Unconverted|url=https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue081-085/Retro_Gamer_Issue_082|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|volume=82|pages=77|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Unconverted|url=https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue071-075/Retro_Gamer_Issue_073|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|volume=73|pages=58|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Daw|first=Mike|date=19 June 2018|title=The joys of living in a Bubble (Bobble)|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-06-19-the-joys-of-living-in-a-bubble-bobble|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925231932/https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-06-19-the-joys-of-living-in-a-bubble-bobble|archive-date=25 September 2020|access-date=25 September 2020|website=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Doolan|first=Liam|date=1 October 2020|title=Taito's 1984 Action Platform Game Ben Bero Beh Joins The Arcade Archives|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/10/taitos_1984_action_platform_game_ben_bero_beh_joins_the_arcade_archives|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006105123/https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/10/taitos_1984_action_platform_game_ben_bero_beh_joins_the_arcade_archives|archive-date=6 October 2020|access-date=31 October 2020|website=[[Nintendo Life]]}}</ref>
