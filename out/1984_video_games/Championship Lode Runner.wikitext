'''''Championship Lode Runner''''' is a sequel to the 1983  [[puzzle-platform game]] ''[[Lode Runner]]''. It was released in 1984 for the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] (as a [[self-booting disk]]), then ported to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]], [[SG-1000]], and [[MSX]]. Mostly the same as ''Lode Runner'', ''Championship Lode Runner'' has levels that are much more difficult. Unlike the original, it does not include a [[level editor]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:ChampionshipLodeRunnerSampleLevel.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot]]

The object of the game is to pick up all the [[Gold coin|gold piece]]s (which appear as piles of gold) and get them to the top.<ref name="gamasutra">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1640/game_design_essentials_20_.php?page=11 | title = Advanced game overview | publisher = Gamasutra | date = | accessdate = 2010-06-08}}</ref> Using non-violent methods, enemies had to be overcome. Bumping into enemies cost the player a life and all of his hard-earned gold pieces. Fifty of the hardest levels ever designed are used and they had to be tackled in proper sequential order. While games can be saved, the player automatically loses a life for restoring his game.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Grannell |first=Craig |date=January 2013 |title=Lode Runner |url=https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____111 |journal=Retro Gamer |issue=111 |pages=24}}</ref>

Unlike the original ''[[Lode Runner]]'' game, this version does not come with a [[level editor]]. Many of the levels made for this game were designed using the built-in level editor from the original game.<ref name=":0" />

== Ports ==
The game was first released for the Apple II. The [[Famicom]] port of the game was published by [[Hudson Soft]]. Famicom players can start at any of the first ten levels while needing [[Password (video games)|password]]s to skip to the next levels. The Apple II version and Famicom offered players a [[wikt:certificate|certificate]] for completing the game.

The [[IBM PC]] [[self-booting disk]] version was written by Doug Greene.

In 1985, [[Sega]] published the game for the [[SG-1000]] in Japan and it was released on the [[Sega Card|My Card]] format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sega.jp/history/hard/sg1000/software.html|title=ソフトウェア一覧: SG-1000|publisher=Sega|accessdate=2020-01-19}}</ref> A port was also released for the [[MSX]]. Both versions were developed by [[Compile (company)|Compile]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compile.co.jp/game/other/sg.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021003185828/http://www.compile.co.jp/game/other/sg.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2002-10-03|title=COMPILE GAME HISTORY -SG-1000-|publisher=Compile|accessdate=2020-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compile.co.jp/game/other/msx.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021003185631/http://www.compile.co.jp/game/other/msx.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2002-10-03|title=COMPILE GAME HISTORY -MSX-|publisher=Compile|accessdate=2020-01-19}}</ref>
