{{nihongo foot|'''''Wild Gunman'''''|ワイルドガンマン|Wairudo Ganman|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[light gun shooter]] game developed and published by [[Nintendo]]. Originally created as an [[Electro-mechanical games|electro-mechanical]] [[arcade game]] in 1974 by [[Gunpei Yokoi]], it was adapted to a video game format for the [[Famicom]] console in 1984. It was released in 1985 as a [[launch game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) with the [[NES Zapper|Zapper]] light gun.

==Original version==
The original version of ''Wild Gunman'' is one of Nintendo's [[Electro-mechanical games|electro-mechanical]] (EM) [[arcade game]]s created by [[Gunpei Yokoi]] and released in 1974. It consists of a [[light gun]] connected to a [[16 mm film|16 mm]] [[projection screen]]. [[Interactive movie|Full-motion video]] footage of an American [[American frontier|Wild West]] gunslinger is [[Video projector|projected]] onto the screen. When this enemy character's eyes flash, the player draws and fires the gun. If the player is fast enough, the projection changes to that of the shot gunman falling down; otherwise it shows the gunman drawing and firing his gun. 

Regardless of their success,<ref>{{cite web | title = ''Wild Gunman - Vierzon 2011'' | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmdOHmnbYHw | website = YouTube}} - Note that the game continues on to the next scene even when the players lose a duel.</ref> the player continues to face off against other gunslinger opponents, of which there are five in total.<ref>{{KLOV game|10432|Wild Gunman (1974)}}</ref> 

Should the player draw their gun prematurely, a "foul" light turns on and the player's input is ignored for the rest of the duel, rendering it unwinnable. 

This version of ''Wild Gunman'' was released in North America by [[Sega]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Cash-Box/70s/1976/Cash-Box-1976-04-24.pdf#page=44|title=SEGA Introduces Two New Games|publisher=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]|date=1976-04-24|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> The game's footage was filmed with local, uncredited [[Extra (acting)|extras]] on location around [[Kyoto]] and at the [[Nara Dreamland]] amusement park.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beyond Donkey Kong: A History of Nintendo Arcade Games|page=15|author=Ken Horowitz|date=August 6, 2020 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476684208}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=In The Chair with Satoru Okada|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=163|page=93|publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref>

The second version has a plastic gunman figure mounted on top of a plastic battery box called ''Custom Gunman'', which later became one of the microgames in the [[Game Boy Advance]] title ''[[WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!]]''.

In Japan, ''Wild Gunman'' was the sixth highest-grossing EM [[1976 in Japan|arcade game of 1976]], below two other Nintendo [[Laser Clay Shooting System]] titles, ''Sky Hawk'' at fourth place and ''Mini Laser Clay'' at fifth.<ref name="GM65">{{cite magazine|title=本紙アンケー 〜 ト調査の結果|trans-title=Paper Questionnaire: Results of the Survey |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=65|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 February 1977|pages=2–3|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19770201p.pdf#page=2}}</ref> In North America, ''Wild Gunman'' was one of the most popular arcade machines at the AMOA 1976 show.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Quick Draw |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=December 18, 1976 |page=42 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1976/Cash-Box-1976-12-18.pdf}}</ref>

The game consists of four film scenes, called Film-A, Film-B, Film-C and Film-D. Each scene was shot on two [[16 mm film]] reels, for displaying [[Multiple endings|alternate outcomes]], making up a total of eight film reels. Two of the original reels were discovered by collector Benjamin Solovey in 2021.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lane |first1=Gavin |title=16mm Film From Nintendo's 1974 Wild Gunman Arcade Cabinet Has Been Found |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/07/16mm_film_from_nintendos_1974_wild_gunman_arcade_cabinet_has_been_found |work=[[Nintendo Life]] |date=2 July 2021}}</ref>

==Video game version==
[[File:NES Wild Gunman.png|frame|left|Screenshot showing typical gameplay of ''Wild Gunman'' for the NES]]
Nintendo converted the electro-mechanical concept into a [[video game]], replacing filmed footage with cartoon-style sprites.

In 1984 in Japan, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] version was released for use with the original version of the [[NES Zapper|Zapper]] gun peripheral. This version, named the ''Beam Gun'', was a plastic, western-style revolver accessory (modeled after the [[Colt Single Action Army]]) that came packaged with a plastic holster belt. In 1985 in the United States, it was released on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].

In the NES version, the player waits for the opponent's eyes to flash (accompanied by a [[Speech balloon|speech bubble]] reading "FIRE!!") before shooting. It features a [[shooting range|shooting gallery]] where opponents are to be shot from the windows of a [[Western saloon|saloon]]. A piece of [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s "[[Funeral march]]" indicates the player's defeat. This version was also published on the [[PlayChoice-10]] arcade system. On the [[Wii U Virtual Console]], the [[Wii remote|Wii Remote]] pointer is used instead of the Zapper.

==Popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=February 2018}}
Experimental filmmaker [[Craig Baldwin]]'s 1978 short ''Wild Gunman'' features footage from the original 1974 arcade game which was re-edited, sped up, and slowed down to surreal effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hi-beam.net/mkr/cb/cb-bio.html#gunman |title=Craig Baldwin |website=Hi-beam.net |access-date=April 9, 2016}}</ref>

The original 1974 arcade game also appears in the 1981 film ''[[Gas (1981 film)|Gas]]'', being played by the main antagonist. The film establishes the antagonist's ruthless cowboy-like personality by juxtaposing directly captured clips of the game with footage of him giving an expository monologue to his sons (and the audience) while playing. After delivering the monologue, he loses to a gunman and proceeds to shoot the game's projector screen multiple times with a real gun. The game's appearance is also a nod to the character's actor, frequent [[western film|western]] star [[Sterling Hayden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acriticalhit.com/wild-gunman-74-the-forgotten-first-fmv-game/|title=''Wild Gunman '74: The Forgotten First FMV Game''|website=acriticalhit.com |date=February 22, 2021|access-date=June 18, 2021}}</ref>

In the 1989 film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', protagonist [[Marty McFly]] plays a non-existent arcade version of the NES ''Wild Gunman'' resembling a [[Nintendo VS. System]] cabinet. The 1990 follow-up, [[Back to the Future Part III|''Part III'']], reveals that frequently playing the game has given Marty the skill to shoot a real revolver. Nintendo re-released the game to the [[Wii U Virtual Console]] on October 21, 2015, to coincide with [[Back to the Future Day|''Back to the Future'' Day]], honoring the game's appearance in the film.<ref name="wired">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/wild-gunman-virtual-console-wii-u/|title= Nintendo Re-Releases Marty McFly's Favorite Game This Week|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=October 21, 2015|access-date=October 21, 2015|first=Chris|last=Kohler}}</ref><ref name="Nintendo Revives">{{cite web | title=Nintendo revives 'Wild Gunman' in time for 'Back to the Future' Day | first=Jon | last=Fingas | date=September 21, 2015 | url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/21/nintendo-back-to-the-future-tribute/ | work=Engadget | access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref>

In the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, the [[Duck Hunt#Legacy|''Duck Hunt'']] duo can summon ''Wild Gunman'' characters to attack their opponents. Their "Final Smash" attack causes opponents to get caught in the middle of a shootout between the gunmen and the enemy characters from ''[[Hogan's Alley (video game)|Hogan's Alley]]''.
