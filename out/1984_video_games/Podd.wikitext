'''''Podd''''' is an [[educational game]] for the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] published by [[Acornsoft]] in 1984. The main character, Podd, teaches [[verb]]s, performing an appropriate animation when a recognised word is typed.

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to find the 120 verbs that Podd recognizes.  Several words are mapped to one animation (e.g. "walk", "hike", "stroll", etc.), and children who realise this will be able to guess more words by thinking of synonyms for the words that have already been discovered.
