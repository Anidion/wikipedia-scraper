'''''Cosmic Cruiser''''' is a game developed by [[Imagine Software]] and released for the [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Dragon 32]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984. The object of the game is to fight off an alien raiding party that has taken over a distant space station and save the crew.

==Gameplay==
The player controls the astronaut, whose first objective is to navigate to the laser cannon and blast holes into the side of the space station through which he can enter.
