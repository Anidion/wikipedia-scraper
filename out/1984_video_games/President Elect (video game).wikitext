'''''President Elect''''' is a [[Turn-based game|turn-based]], [[Government simulation game|political simulation game]], first released by [[Strategic Simulations]] for the Apple II in [[1981 in video gaming|1981]], followed by a Commodore 64 port in 1984. The sequel, ''[[President Elect: 1988 Edition]]'', appeared in 1987. 

==Description==
''President Elect'' gives the player the ability to play as various real historical, potential historical, or completely fictional presidential candidates during the [[United States presidential election|Presidential campaigns]] from [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] to [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] (most versions also include the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] campaign).  Players are given the option of playing a "Historical" or "Ahistorical" scenario for each of the given years.  Under the "Historical" option, the candidates, as well as economic and foreign policy conditions, and the status of the [[Incumbent#In politics|incumbent]], are fixed.  During an "Ahistorical" session, all of those variables can be determined by the player (for example, the player can choose a [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] race between an incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], versus a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]], in the midst of an unpopular war and an economic boom).  Alternatively, players can select the option of creating a fictional presidential candidate (or a real candidate from outside of the game's timeframe), through the selection of various political, personal, and geographic attributes (somewhat in the manner of creating an [[Role-playing game|RPG]] [[player character]]).  In addition, there is the option of selecting an "Ahistorical" set of candidates within the otherwise "Historical" conditions of the selected year.  The game is preset with not only all the major candidates of the elections covered by the span of the game, but also a number of hypothetical candidates from across the time frame, such as [[Jerry Brown]], [[George W. Romney|George Romney]], [[Gary Hart]], and [[Howard Baker]].<ref name="compute">{{cite journal|last1=Bobo|first1=Ervin|title=President Elect: 1988 Edition|journal=Compute!|date=October 1987|issue=89|page=32|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue89/President_Elect.php}}</ref>

The game can be played with either two or three candidates (for example, the "Historical" scenarios for 1968 and 1980 include [[Third party (United States)|third party]] candidates [[George C. Wallace]] and [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]], respectively, and "Ahistorical" scenarios for any year can include the addition of a third party candidate), and the computer can control any or all of the candidates (thus allowing for the possibility of a non-player, straight simulation of an electoral scenario), meaning the game can be played by one, two, or three players.

[[Gameplay]] centers on the activity of dispersing PAPs ("Political Action Points"), which are approximately equivalent to campaign funds, in terms of their relationship to real life presidential campaigning, as well as scheduling personal, campaign visits to various states.  Additionally, at the end of each of the nine, week-long, post-[[Labor Day]] game turns, there is a potential [[United States presidential election debates|debate]] phase.

The role of the [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] [[running mate]] is extremely limited, in that the running mate's identity is never given, but rather is simply represented by his or her being from a particular state, thus giving the [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] an electoral advantage in that particular state, and to a lesser extent in the other states within the region of the running mate's home state (for purposes of the game, the country is broken up into seven different regions, corresponding to: [[New England]], the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]], [[Southern United States|the South]], the [[Midwestern United States|Industrial Midwest]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Mountain States]], and the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coastal States]]), although the vice presidential candidate's role in any state or region other than his own is nonexistent. The vice presidential candidate can tour foreign countries which if favourable gives an advantage in the elections. A foreign tour can also be performed by presidential candidate, but it shortens the election campaigning that can be taken up by him for that particular week depending on the number of days for which the tour is taken up. Foreign tour costs PAPs, the amount of which is dependent on the number of days. A failed foreign tour can negatively impact polls, while a successful tour can cause a given candidate to see a polling surge. 

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' found in 1981 that incumbency was the most important factor in winning elections in the original version of ''President Elect''. The review began with the results of a simulated election in which [[Ronald Reagan]] won reelection in 1984 with 525 electoral votes from 49 states and 55% of the popular vote, versus [[Walter Mondale]]'s 13 electoral votes (from [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Minnesota]]) and 44%.<ref name="sipe19811112">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1981&pub=2&id=1 | title=The Political Apple | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=Nov–Dec 1981 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Sipe, Russell | pages=23}}</ref> The results of the [[1984 United States presidential election|real 1984 election]] were very similar, with the same candidates receiving the same electoral votes from the same states, and a 59%/41% popular vote.<ref name="sipe198501">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1985&pub=2&id=20 | title=You Read It Here First! | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=January 1985 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Sipe, Russell | pages=13}}</ref>
