Jasper Sylvester reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Reforger '88'' is an excellent game using a free-flowing and user-friendly system which is satisfying to play from the initial boot to the last turn of battle. It is the product of an incredible amount of research and even a perusal of the list of weapon systems makes some Pentagon budget considerations seem clearer."<ref name="CGW22">{{cite magazine |last=Sylvester |first=Jasper |title=Micro-Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=June–July 1985 |volume=1 |issue=22 |pages=33}}</ref>

In a 1985 survey of computer wargames for ''Current Notes'', M. Evan Brooks called ''Reforger '88'' a flawed title that "suffer[s] from the same defects as ''Objective: Kursk''", although he considered it "somewhat more successful".<ref name=cn1985 /> In his similar 1989 survey, J. L. Miller of ''Computer Play'' called ''Reforger'' "somewhat dated" and offered it a middling score.<ref name=computerplay />
