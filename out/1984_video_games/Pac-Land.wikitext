{{nihongo foot|'''''Pac-Land'''''|パックランド|Pakku Rando|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1984 [[side-scrolling]] arcade [[platform game]] developed and released by [[Namco]]. It was distributed in North America by [[Bally Midway]], and in Europe by [[Atari Games]]. Controlling [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], the player must make it to the end of each stage to return a lost fairy back to its home in Fairyland. Pac-Man will need to avoid obstacles, such as falling logs and water-spewing fire hydrants, alongside his enemies, the Ghost Gang. Eating large flashing Power Pellets will cause the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points.

''Pac-Land'' was created by Namco Research and Development 1 programmer Yoshihiro Kishimoto, who was tasked with creating an arcade game based on the American [[Pac-Man (TV series)|''Pac-Man'' cartoon television series]] by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. The backgrounds were made to be vibrant and colorful, and the characters to be detailed and move smoothly to match the show's animation style. The control scheme was inspired by [[Konami]]'s ''[[Track & Field (video game)|Track & Field]]'' (1983), using buttons instead of a traditional joystick to make it stand out among other games at the time. A new [[Namco Pac-Land]] arcade system was created to make it easier to develop the game and was used for several later Namco games, including ''[[Baraduke]]'' (1985) and ''[[Metro-Cross]]'' (1985).

''Pac-Land'' was a commercial success in arcades, becoming one of the top five highest-grossing [[1985 in video games|arcade games of 1985]] in the United States. It was well-received by critics for its colorful graphics, stage designs, and soundtrack, although was often criticized for its difficulty. It is cited as an important and influential game in the platform genre, paving the way for many games to follow such as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Ghosts'n Goblins]]'', ''[[Alex Kidd]]'' and ''[[Wonder Boy]]''. It was ported to several home consoles and computers, including the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]], [[PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Atari Lynx]]. It is the first platform game in the ''[[List of Pac-Man video games|Pac-Man]]'' series, and was followed by ''[[Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures]]'' (1994).

==Gameplay==

Controlling [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], the player is tasked with reaching the end of each level while avoiding enemies and other obstacles. Stages are known in-game as "trips" and are broken into four sections — the first three have Pac-Man running to return a lost fairy back to "Fairyland", and the last having Pac-Man return home to his family. Pressing either of the directional buttons will make Pac-Man walk in that direction, and repeatedly tapping either button will make him run. Pac-Man can also jump over pits and obstacles by pressing the jump button.<ref name="Lynx Manual">{{cite book |title=Pac-Land Atari Lynx instruction manual |date=1992 |publisher=[[Atari Games]] |url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareID=2383 |access-date=9 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317200610/https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareID=2383 |archive-date=17 March 2017}}</ref>

In each stage, Pac-Man will encounter the four ghosts from the original game — Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde — alongside a purple ghost named Sue, originally a replacement for Clyde in ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''.<ref name="Lynx Manual"/> Eating large flashing Power Pellets will cause the ghosts to turn blue for a short time, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.<ref name="Lynx Manual"/> The ghosts are often seen driving vehicles, such as airplanes, buses, cars, pogo-sticks and flying saucers, and will sometimes drop miniature ghost enemies from the air to try and hit Pac-Man.<ref name="Lynx Manual"/> Other types of obstacles are also present in stages, such as water-spewing fire hydrants, springboards, falling logs, quicksand and geysers.<ref name="Lynx Manual"/>

Trips consist of cities, forests, deserts and abandoned castles. Most trip sections end with a large sign saying "BREAK TIME" with a church on a hill in the background, and bonus points are awarded for jumping at certain points at the end of each section.<ref name="IGN TG16"/> The final section of a trip gives Pac-Man a special pair of boots that will allow him to jump infinitely into the air, and tasks the player with returning home to Pac-Man's family.<ref name="Lynx Manual"/> The player can find hidden items by pushing against specific objects in certain stages, including a helmet that protects Pac-Man from falling mini ghosts, an item that makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible, and a [[Galaxian|''Galaxian'' flagship]] that awards the player a large sum of points.<ref name="Lynx Manual"/><ref name="KLOV"/> Jumping in certain spots will reveal fruit items that can be consumed for points.<ref name="KLOV"/>

The game features the theme song from the [[Pac-Man (TV series)|''Pac-Man'' cartoon series]], which plays in a constant loop throughout.<ref name="IGN TG16"/> The North American version of the game by Midway features the characters being re-designed to more closely resemble the designs found in the show, while the Japanese Namco version has the characters modeled after ''Pac-Man'' marketing material and cabinet artwork. It's currently unknown what version the European version looks like.<ref name="IGN TG16"/><ref name="KLOV">{{cite web |title=Pac-Land - Videogame by Bally Midway |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8955 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |access-date=9 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626224036/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8955 |archive-date=26 June 2019}}</ref>

==Development and release==
''Pac-Land'' was programmed by Yoshihiro Kishimoto of Namco Development Division 1, who would later work on the ''[[Family Stadium]]'' franchise. After seeing the success of the American [[Pac-Man (TV series)|''Pac-Man'' cartoon series]], Namco requested Kishimoto that he create an arcade game based on the show.<ref name="Untold History">{{cite book |last1=Szczepaniak |first1=John |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers Vol. 2 |date=4 November 2015 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |isbn=978-1518655319 |pages=207–208 |edition=1 |url=https://archive.org/details/TheUntoldHistoryOfJapaneseGameDevelopersVol.2JohnSzczepaniak/page/n207 |access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> Kishimoto stated that the hardest part of development were Pac-Man's animations. Most arcade games in Japan at the time simply used two or three frames to convey movement, which he found unconvincing.<ref name="Untold History"/> The team wanted the game's backgrounds to be vibrant and colorful, and to have the characters move smoothly to replicate the show's animation style.<ref name="Untold History"/> Pac-Man himself was given 24 different frame patterns, alongside several facial expressions and clothing swaps.<ref name="Untold History"/>

Kishimoto cited Konami's [[sports video game]] ''[[Track & Field (video game)|Track & Field]]'' (1983) as the "number one influence" on ''Pac-Land''. The game's controls were heavily influenced by ''Track & Field'', a game that allowed the player to become faster by constantly tapping the button in succession;<ref name="Untold History"/> Kishimoto thought the idea was interesting and that it would make it stand out among other games.<ref name="Untold History"/> To allow for two-layer scrolling backgrounds, more sprites, and more colors, the team created the [[Namco Pac-Land]] arcade board, which was used for several later Namco games including ''[[Baraduke]]'' (1985) and ''[[Metro-Cross]]'' (1985).<ref name="Untold History"/> The game was tested in [[Yokohama]], where Kishimoto recalls the springboards being difficult for new players.<ref name="Untold History"/>

The arcade game was released in Japan in 1984, but there are conflicting release dates. ''Arcade TV Game List'', a Japanese-language book of arcade release dates authored by Masumi Akagi and published by the Amusement News Agency in 2006, lists the Japanese release date as August 1984.<ref name="Akagi">{{cite book |last1=Akagi |first1=Masumi |title=アーケードTVゲームリスト国内•海外編(1971-2005) |trans-title=Arcade TV Game List: Domestic • Overseas Edition (1971-2005) |date=13 October 2006 |publisher=Amusement News Agency |lang=ja |location=Japan |isbn=978-4990251215 |pages=52, 125 |url=https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005/page/n53}}</ref> However, the United States Copyright Office<ref name="Copyright">{{cite web |title=Pac-land.

Though based on the original arcade version, this re-release was modified by Bandai Namco to replace the graphics of [[Ms. Pac-Man]] and Baby Pac-Man, who greet Pac-Man at the end of each trip. In their place are two new characters named "Pac-Mom" and "Pac-Sis"; which were created for the then-upcoming compilation Pac-Man Museum+, which also replaced the characters in all the games featured in the collection.

The only feature of ''Pac-Land'' Miyamoto cites as a direct inspiration was the blue background of the game as opposed to the black ones he typically would put in his games.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eno |first=Kenji  |author-link=Kenji Eno |date=June 1, 1998 |title=スーパーヒットゲーム学 単行本 |publisher=Fusosha |isbn=9784594025052 }}</ref>

Shortly after the game's release, Namco produced a board game adaptation for its ''Fantasy Board Game'' series, based on the player reaching the end of the board without losing the "fairy chip". A Japanese LCD handheld game was released in 1990. Many of Pac-Man's moves in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series are directly based on ''Pac-Land,'' such as his fire hydrant attack. ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' include a stage based on the game, featuring automatic scrolling.<ref name="Destructoid"/>
