The game presents a backdrop of Washington, with various landmarks such as the [[Washington Monument]] visible. Flying saucers descend from the top of the screen. The player has to move a [[crosshair]] at the saucers and fire bullets to destroy them. If allowed to proceed unharmed, saucers will hover near a famous landmark and shoot a beam of [[electricity]] at it, eventually destroying it. If all landmarks are destroyed, the game is lost.
