==Reception==
''[[Commodore Microcomputers]]'' stated that "''Dream House'' is not exactly a game ... but it is just as entertaining and challenging as any traditional game out there". The reviewer concluded that it "has not replaced nor diminished my old stand-by dream-weaving habitual hobby" of drawing homes on graph paper, but "with ''Dream House'', dreaming comes that much closer to coming true".<ref name="essoe198509">{{Cite magazine |last=Essoe |first=Kelley |date=September–October 1985 |title=Dream House |url=https://archive.org/stream/Commodore_MicroComputer_Issue_37_1985_Sep_Oct#page/n23/mode/2up |magazine=Commodore Microcomputers |pages=22,124–125}}</ref>
