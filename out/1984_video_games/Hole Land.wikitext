==Gameplay==

Player controls a multi-colored robot able to move to right and left, jump and shoot enemies such as small humanoids, rats, ghosts and snakes that come from holes above on the screen, vertically far away from the player, who stands always at the bottom of the stage and has to eliminate them all before they reach the bottom or simply avoid them to complete each level.<ref name="gh">{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=hole-land&page=detail&id=1136|title=Hole Land|publisher=Gaming History}}</ref> Enemies are able to attack the player with bombs, making him unable to jump, move and shoot for a short time.<ref name="klov"/> The player can also become defenseless getting hit by incoming rocks from vulcans.<ref name="klov"/> A life is lost when enemies touch the player and take away the robot's lower half, which can be avoided by jumping over them without touching them.<ref name="gh"/>

The game has three stages.<ref name="klov"/> In the first two, each time the robot is damaged by rocks and bombs, a friendly, short, old man appears to help fix it.<ref name="klov"/>

At the last part of the third one, the player faces off the game's boss: a [[grotesque]] giant monster with a ball-shaped body and an enormous mouth with pointed teeth.<ref name="klov"/> The goal is to shoot and destroy all of its teeth before it can reaches the player's position, otherwise the monster will devour the robot.<ref name="klov"/> If the player manages to win the boss, he is returned to the first stage.
