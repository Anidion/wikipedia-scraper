==Development and release==
''Black Belt'' was programmed by Kevin Ryan for publisher [[Earthware Computer Services]], based in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. The company had previously published the Apple II titles ''Volcanos'', ''Star Search'', and ''Zoo Master'', the last of which was also programmed by Ryan and released in 1983.<ref>{{cite magazine | author=''Softalk'' staff | date=January 1982 | title=Marketalk Reviews | url=https://archive.org/details/softalkv2n05jan1982/page/98/mode/2up | publisher=Softalk Publishing Inc. | magazine=Softalk | volume=2 | issue=5 | pages=98–9 | issn=0274-9629}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | author=''Apple Orchard'' staff | date=June 1983 | title=Games/Simulations | url=https://archive.org/details/Apple-Orchard-v4n4-1983-Jun/page/n93/mode/1up | publisher=International Apple Core | magazine=Apple Orchard | volume=4 | issue=4 | page=90}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | author=''Softalk'' staff | date=October 1983 | title=Marketalk Reviews | url=https://archive.org/details/softalkv4n02oct1983/page/182/mode/1up | publisher=Softalk Publishing Inc. | magazine=Softalk | volume=4 | issue=2 | page=182 | issn=0274-9629}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=''inCider'' staff | date=November 1983 | title=Home & Family Entertainment | url=https://archive.org/details/inCider_83-11/page/n174/mode/1up | publisher=CW Communications Inc. | magazine=[[Wayne Green|inCider]] | page=175 | issn=1054-6456}}</ref> Alongside the instructions for ''Black Belt'' was a handbook containing a message from Earthware head Donna J. Goles, explaining that the game should  serve as an [[Educational video game|educational]] supplement to traditional taekwondo training. She concluded, "If it has no other effect, we hope it will help to dispel the [[Effects of violence in mass media|image of aggressive violence]] which shrouds the image of all of the martial arts owing to television." The handbook includes history, terminology, and rules of the sport.<ref name="handbook"/> Ryan consulted with his own taekwondo instructor Master Hwang in Eugene for its gameplay intricacies.<ref name="hcg101"/> Although both versions of the game contain a 1984 copyright, the Apple II edition may have been available as early as 1983.<ref name="hcg101"/> However, the Apple-centric magazine ''[[Softalk]]'' did not list the game as new commercially released software until its June 1984 issue.<ref>{{cite magazine | author=''Softalk'' staff | date=June 1984 | title=Fastalk: Home-Arcade | url=https://archive.org/details/softalkv4n10jun1984/page/n173/mode/1up | publisher=Softalk Publishing Inc. | magazine=Softalk | volume=4 | issue=10 | page=172 | issn=0274-9629}}</ref> The game is compatible with the Apple [[Mockingboard]] for additional sound.<ref name="applebook"/> The Commodore 64 port replaced the graphical [[dither]]ing in its Apple II counterpart with more individual colors and added [[Speech synthesis|synthesized speech]].<ref name="hcg101"/> Ryan began working for the newly-founded [[Dynamix]] in 1984 shortly after the release of ''Black Belt''.<ref>{{cite magazine | author=''Retro Gamer'' staff | date=September 2010 | title=From the Archives: Dynamix | pages=56–7 | issue=80 | magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] | publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] | issn=1742-3155}}</ref>

==Reception==
Sparse critical reception of ''Black Belt'' was mostly positive. Rick Teverbaugh praised the game in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' while mistaking its form of martial arts as karate instead of taekwondo: "If it weren't for ''[[Competition Karate]]'', this would be the game all other karate games would be measured against [...] The graphics are fluid and well-drawn. It is quite easy to see what you're doing and its effect on the other combatant."<ref name="CGW27"/> ''The Book of Apple Software'' rated ''Black Belt'' with an B– (minus), similarly appreciating the graphics and animation and summarizing it as vividly and realistically recreating the sport of taekwondo.<ref name="applebook"/> Eric Cabérla of the French magazine ''[[Tilt (French magazine)|Tilt]]'' was conversely disappointed in its visuals while also criticizing the quality of the sound effects.<ref name="tilt"/> [[Hardcore Gaming 101]] noted that ''Black Belt'' technically contains the first fighting game [[Tutorial (video games)|tutorial]] and that having different horizontal planes on which to battle pre-dates the similar [[Fatal Fury#Gameplay|mechanic in ''Fatal Fury'']].<ref name="hcg101"/>
