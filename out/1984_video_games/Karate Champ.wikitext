{{nihongo|'''''Karate Champ'''''|カラテ・チャンプ|Karate Chanpu}}, originally known as {{nihongo|'''''Karate Dō'''''|空手道|"The Way of the Empty Hand"}}, is a [[fighting game]] developed by [[Technōs Japan]] and released in arcades by [[Data East]] in 1984. A variety of moves can be performed using the [[Dual analog control|dual-joystick]] controls using a best-of-three matches format like later fighting games. The game was commercially successful, especially in the United States where it was the {{nowrap|highest-grossing}} [[1985 in video games|arcade game of 1985]] and the [[List of best-selling PC games|best-selling home computer game]] up until 1989. ''Karate Champ'' established and popularized the one-on-one fighting game genre, for which it is considered one of the most influential games of all time.

An updated version that allows two players the option to compete against each other was released in 1984 under the title {{nihongo|'''''Karate Champ&nbsp;— Player vs Player'''''|対戦空手道 美少女青春編|Taisen Karate Dō: Bishōjo Seishun Hen|"The Competitive Way of the Empty Hand: Pretty Maiden Edition"}}, featuring a [[multiplayer]] mode and more varied gameplay. It was released for the arcades shortly after the original during the same year, also published by Data East. This version was released internationally as ''Karate Champ'' (the original single-player version was exclusive to Japan),<ref name="data_east_v_epyx"/> and would serve as the basis for the home versions of ''Karate Champ''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Karate Champ.png|thumb|left|Gameplay of ''Karate Champ'']]
Using two [[joystick]]s, players can execute 24 moves. Gameplay consists of a two dimensional fight between the first [[karateka]] wearing a white [[karate gi|gi]] who is controlled by player one and the second karateka wearing a red gi who is controlled by either player two or the CPU, followed by various bonus rounds for the successful player. This pattern repeats itself in the next, more challenging round set against a new background, the first level being a [[dojo]] and all following levels taking place at the same tournament stadium.

Unlike most later fighting games, there is no [[Health_(game_terminology)#Health_meter|health bar]] or [[Health_(game_terminology)#Hit_point|hit point system]]. A hit successfully landed ends the round and earns the hitter either one point or half point (along with a numeric score for the top ten, but this has no effect on winning a match). The first to score two points is the winner. If the player loses a battle, the game ends. The game features [[speech synthesis|digitized speech]] for the judge to call out such phrases as "Half point" or "Full point". The speech is in Japanese in the original version.

=== ''Player vs Player'' ===
''Karate Champ — Player vs Player'' is distinguished from the initial ''Karate Champ'' by the addition of a [[player versus player]] mode. It is very similar to the original in the sense that they use the same hardware, improved speech, some new [[sprite_(computer graphics)|sprites]] and title screen, and the gameplay mechanics are basically the same.

''Player vs Player'' has the characters fighting it out over girls in twelve different locations around the world (similar to the later [[SNK]]'s ''[[Street Smart (video game)|Street Smart]]''). A scene runs as a best out of three rounds competition for one girl. After every competition, the player has a chance to earn [[Score (game)|bonus points]] by evading a series of potted plants flying at the player, kicking through a series of boards and stopping a charging bull. The locations of the game are: A harbor, a garden with a view of [[Mount Fuji]], a bamboo forest, on a tree trunk over a chasm, on the stern of a Japanese registered ship, on the side of a road or runway, [[Holland]] with windmills, a big city, a North American desert with Indian [[tipi]]s, a [[Japanese garden]], a dojo, and finally a forest path at night. Afterwards, the game returns to the first scene for a second loop. Completing all 10 scenes again completes the game.

==Versions and re-releases==
''Karate Champ'' was converted to the [[Apple II]] and the [[Commodore 64]] by [[Berkeley Softworks]]. Data East began publishing the home versions in the USA on October 12, 1985.<ref name="data_east_v_epyx">''Data East v. Epyx'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/862/862.F2d.204.87-2294.html 862 F. 2d 204, 9 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1322] {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516005748/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/862/862.F2d.204.87-2294.html | date=2010-05-16}} (9th Cir. 1988).</ref> The [[NES]] version was released in North America in December 1986.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://retrocdn.net/File:ComputerEntertainer_US_Vol.5_10.pdf | title = Computer Entertainer: the Newsletter, January 1987 | access-date = 2017-03-23}}</ref> Like the home computer versions, the NES conversion was inspired by the ''Player vs. Player'' edition of the arcade game, this version was later released in Japan for the [[Family Computer Disk System|Disk System]] on July 22, 1988, but never made it to the cartridge-based Family Computer. Data East published this version of the game, both in North America and Japan.

An [[emulator|emulation]] of the arcade version was released by [[Hamster Corporation|Hamster]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] as part of its ''[[Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono]]'' lineup. Only the original game was included (the ''Player vs. Player'' version being ignored from the compilation). The emulated version from Hamster was re-released in 2015 for the [[PlayStation 4]] on the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' compilation which, unlike ''Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono'', was officially distributed outside of Japan.

In 2010, it was released on the [[iPhone]] platform by developer Revolutionary Concepts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://toucharcade.com/2010/05/07/classic-fighter-karate-champ-gameplay-video-released/ | title=Classic Fighter 'Karate Champ' Gameplay Video Released | author=Hodapp, Eli | date=2010-05-07 | access-date=2010-05-07}}</ref> Although visually identical to the 1984 arcade edition of ''Karate Champ&nbsp;— Player vs Player'', the iPhone version is actually a remake rather than an emulation, as it includes new features such as a difficulty mode as well as the ability for players to compete through a gaming network via [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toucharcade.com/2010/05/20/karate-champ-delivers-a-roundhouse-kick-to-the-app-store/|title='Karate Champ' Delivers a Roundhouse Kick to the App Store|date=20 May 2010|website=Toucharcade.com}}</ref> The game was also released for the [[iPad]] under the title '''''Karate Champ XL''''', again developed by Revolutionary Concepts. ''Karate Champ XL'' is basically the same game as the iPhone's ''Karate Champ'', but with additional attributes over its phone counterpart such as a split-screen option.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iphonelife.com/blog/29299/karate-champ-xl-review|title=[REVIEW] Karate Champ XL|date=15 July 2012|website=iPhoneLife.com}}</ref>

The arcade version and the NES version were released in 2018 by Dreamgear LLC under its "My Arcade" brand. The arcade version of ''Karate Champ'' is part of a compilation released in the shape of a mini arcade cabinet featuring 34 Data East games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamester81.com/myarcade-data-east-classics-minicade/|title=MyArcade Data East Classics MiniCade!|website=Gamester81.com|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> The NES version was released both as a standalone mini arcade cabinet and in a handheld device that includes 300 built-in games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/12/17109454/mini-arcade-machines-amazon-data-east|title=What the My Arcade line of mini arcade cabinets gets right about nostalgia|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|date=12 March 2018|website=Polygon.com|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://readretro.com/data-east-classic-titles-making-return-via-my-arcade-gaming-deal/|title=Data East Classic Titles Making Return Via My Arcade Gaming Deal|date=11 January 2018|website=Readretro.com|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> In the case of the NES version, the referee's digital voice was removed and the music tracks were replaced. The arcade version is unedited. Since My Arcade's releases are [[single-player]] only, the two-player mode was removed from the NES version, and the ''Karate Champ&nbsp;— Player vs Player'' edition was not included in the compilation of 34 arcade games.

The NES version returned as part of the "Data East Collection 1" set for the [[Evercade]] handheld console.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/05/exclusive_the_evercade_handheld_is_getting_earthworm_jim_clayfigher_and_midnight_resistance|title = Exclusive: The Evercade Handheld is Getting Earthworm Jim, Clayfigher and Midnight Resistance|date = 22 May 2019}}</ref> Except for the removal of the Nintendo license on the game's titlescreen, the re-release is identical to the 1986 original with all soundtracks and digital voice intact as well as the two-player mode.

===Home computers===
On home computers in the United States, Data East's ''Karate Champ'' floppy disk received a "Gold Award" from the [[Software Publishers Association]] (SPA) in July 1987 for sales above 100,000 units, then a "Platinum Award" for over 250,000 sales in February 1988, and then a "Diamond Award" for sales above 500,000 units in January 1989. It was the first game to receive the "Diamond Award" from the SPA, and it was one of the top two [[List of best-selling PC games|best-selling computer games]] in the United States (along with ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?

Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the home computer version for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', stating the game is "fast-paced" and "the graphics are very good" but "my only complaint is that some of the in-match options are counters for a move of your opponent, but there often isn't any time for those reactions".<ref name="CGW27">{{cite magazine |last=Teverbaugh |first=Rick |title=Sports Scorecard |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1986 |volume=1 |issue=27 |pages=41}}</ref> ''[[Ahoy!]]'' opined that the [[Commodore 64]] version "isn't quite as electrifying as the arcade version, but it's an entertaining action-strategy test". The magazine concluded that "the learning curve is steep, but ... when the joysticks are in the hands of two practiced gamers, it is one of the most exciting games to hit the computer screen in a long time".<ref name="katz198601">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_25_1986-01_Ion_International_US#page/n51/mode/2up | title=Karate Champ | work=Ahoy! | date=January 1986 | access-date=2 July 2014 | author=Katz, Arnie | pages=53–54}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Karate Champ'' inspired numerous martial arts games.<ref name="megahits"/> Its release was followed by a wave of [[karate]] and [[kung fu]] games attempting to capitalize on its success.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Carter |first1=Jay |title=The Great Screen Test Of 1985 |magazine=[[Cash Box]] |date=1985-08-24 |pages=39, 41 |url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox49unse_9/page/39 |publisher=Cash Box Pub.

''Karate Champ'' influenced titles such as [[Konami]]'s ''[[Yie Ar Kung-Fu]]'' (1985), [[Beam Software]]'s ''[[The Way of the Exploding Fist]]'' (1985), and other fighting games.<ref>{{cite web|title=IGN's Top 10 Most Influential Games|url=http://games.ign.com/articles/840/840621p1.html|author=Ryan Geddes & Daemon Hatfield|date=2007-12-10|website=ign.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604020558/http://games.ign.com/articles/840/840621p1.html|archive-date=June 4, 2012|access-date=2009-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|date=January 1995|title=Data East and Capcom Settle their Disputes|url=https://retrocdn.net/images/8/8d/EGM_US_066.pdf|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|issue=66|page=68|quote=Data East created the one-on-one fighting game genre in the 1980s with ''Karate Champ'' ...}}</ref> [[John Tobias]] cited ''Karate Champ'' as the primary inspiration for the gameplay of ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://index.html/|title=John Tobias, Mortal Kombat co-creator {{!}} Interview {{!}} The Gameological Society|website=Index.html|language=en|access-date=2019-01-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813222110/http://index.html/|archive-date=2013-08-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1985, Data East began taking legal action against counterfeit arcade manufacturers, both in Japan and internationally.<ref name="GM259"/> Data East later brought suit against [[Epyx]] alleging copyright infringement for its 1986 game ''[[International Karate|World Karate Championship]]''. The case, ''[[Data East USA, Inc. v.
