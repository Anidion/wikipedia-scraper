==Reception==
[[David Langford|Dave Langford]] reviewed ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'' for ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' #61, and stated that "I borrowed two SF/Adventure buffs and watched in awe as they swiftly solved the first challenge (basically, you have to do the obvious thing quickly or get zapped). [...] The second scene halted my trusty suckers. They complained that the wretched program wouldn't let them go anywhere or do anything interesting. They sat admiring its incredibly slow response time, frustrated by the effort to find a command which didn't give 'Try another object/action' or 'You can't do that, Jim/Slippery Jim/James/diGriz/Rat'. . . Eventually the test crew went home, cursing the name of Shards Software (the programmers) and muttering things like 'Harry Harrison should sue'. Perhaps this experience is not typical."<ref name="WD61">{{cite magazine  | last =Langford | first =Dave | author-link =David Langford | title =Critical Mass  | magazine =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | issue =61  | pages =11  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  | date = January 1985  }}</ref>
