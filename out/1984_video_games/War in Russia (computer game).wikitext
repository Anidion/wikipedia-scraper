'''''War in Russia''''' is a 1984 [[computer wargame]] developed and published by [[Strategic Simulations]] for the [[Apple II]] and [[Atari 8-bit computers]]. It was designed by [[Gary Grigsby]].<ref name="brookssurvey199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Brooks' Book Of Wargames: 1900-1950, R-Z | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | accessdate=26 March 2016 | author=Brooks, M.

Grigsby later built on ''War in Russia'' with his project ''[[Second Front: Germany Turns East]]'' (1990), initially planned as a [[remake]] of the game. ''Second Front'' then supplied the foundation for ''[[Gary Grigsby's War in Russia]]'' (1993), another successor product.

==Development==
''War in Russia'' was designed by [[Gary Grigsby]] and released in 1984, the same year he launched ''[[Objective: Kursk]]'' and ''[[Reforger '88]]''.<ref name=guru>{{cite magazine | authorlink=Alan Emrich |last=Emrich |first=Alan | title=The Pioneering Spirit of a Wargame Guru | date=September 1995 | issue=134 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=201, 202, 204 }}</ref>

In a 1985 survey of computer wargames for ''Current Notes'', M. Evan Brooks called ''War in Russia'' the definitive monster wargame and "another essential addition to the Wargamer's Library", despite noting the challenge of its large scope and the flaws with its artificial intelligence.<ref name=cn1985 />

In his 1989 survey of computer wargames, J. L. Miller of ''Computer Play'' recommended ''War in Russia'', which he found highly detailed and "much more complex" than [[Strategic Studies Group]]'s competing product ''[[Russia: The Great War in the East 1941–1945]]''. However, he said that it contained "more flaws as well" and noted that "the AI does not handle the later stages of the war well".<ref name=computerplay />
