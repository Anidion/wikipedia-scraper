'''''Quest of the Space Beagle''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] written by Scott Lamb for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published by [[Avalon Hill|Avalon Hill Microcomputer Games]] in 1984.<ref name=giantlist/> It is the sequel to ''[[Jupiter Mission 1999]]''.<ref name=mania/> A [[Commodore 64]] port followed in 1985.<ref name=gb64/>

==Gameplay==
''Quest of the Space Beagle'' is a collection of [[minigame]]s about the player finding and returning to Earth after a failed trip to [[Jupiter]] in the previous game.<ref name=ciraolo/>

==Development==
Scott Lamb wrote the game in [[Atari BASIC]].<ref name=mania/>

The manual contains a note about a programming technique used to create the visuals: "One effect employs alternating graphics screens every 60th second, which considerably extends the graphics capabilities of the Atari computer. A side effect of this technique is flicker."<ref name=man3/>

==Reception==
In an ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' review, Michael Ciraolo wrote, "there is little incentive to get to the next level so the game gets boring quickly. You do the same thing again and again."<ref name=ciraolo/> He also disliked the flickering effect of the graphics. Steve Hudson wrote in ''[[Compute!]]'': "The game's programmers have used some pretty fancy techniques to jazz up an already exciting game," and called one screen "an incredibly realistic display".<ref name=hudson/>
