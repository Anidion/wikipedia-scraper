{{nihongo|'''''Doughboy'''''|ダウ・ボーイ|Dauboi}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://superfamicom.org/famicom/info/dough-boy/ | title = English-Japanese title translation | publisher = SuperFamicom.org | date = | accessdate = 2011-05-19}}</ref> is a [[Commodore 64]] video game by Ken Coates released in North America in 1984. A port for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] was released in Japan in 1985 with the spelling changed to ''Dough Boy''.

''[[Doughboy]]'' is a nickname given to [[United States Army|American]] soldiers during the [[World War I|First World War]] because they would often rush into battle while wearing white dust on them; this originated in the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1848 when they had to march through the deserts of northern [[Mexico]].<ref name="Origin of Term Doughboy">Hanlon, Michael E., ''The Origins of Doughboy'', 16 June 2003, [http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/origindb.htm Origin of Term Doughboy]</ref>

[[File:DoughBoyFamicomVideoGameScreenshot.png|left|thumb|During the later missions in the game, getting run over by a tank leads to instantly losing a life.]]

The player must rescue a [[prisoner of war|POW]] from a [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]].<ref name="odino">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/578263-dough-boy/faqs/46503 | title = Basic summary | publisher = odino ([[GameFAQs]]) | date = | accessdate = 2011-05-19}}</ref><ref name="famicomreviews">{{cite web | url = http://www.famicomreviews.com/2011/04/famicom-review/dough-boy/ | title = Basic summary (second reference) | publisher = Famicom Reviews | date = | accessdate = 2011-05-19 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110502011308/http://www.famicomreviews.com/2011/04/famicom-review/dough-boy/ | archivedate = 2011-05-02}}</ref>

Players can die by being shot, falling into water (by [[drowning]]), being blown up by a [[land mine]], and being run over by a tank.<ref name="odino"/> Players are in possession of machine gun and can use dynamite as a way to attack the enemies. A strict time limit of 24 hours (five real-time minutes) is used in order to keep the pace of the game relatively brisk.<ref name="odino"/> After each round is completed, time is taken off the clock to make things more difficult.<ref name="odino"/>
