==Reception==
David Long reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "I have been involved in the world of judo since 1959, and taekwondo (Korean style of karate) since 1975, while my wife is a two time US champion as well as a Pan Am gold medalist. We both found CK to be truly reflective of the type of tactics which actually win in top level competition; specifically to move a lot, conserve your energy, and make a few good attacks rather than many ineffective ones."<ref name="CGW20">{{cite magazine |last=Long |first=David |title=Micro-Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=February 1985 |volume=1 |issue=20 |pages=35}}</ref>
