'''''Puzzle Panic''''', also known as '''''Ken Uston's Puzzle Panic''''', is a [[puzzle video game]] created by [[blackjack]] strategist [[Ken Uston]], Bob Polin (designer of ''[[Blue Max (video game)|Blue Max]]''), and Ron Karr. It was published by [[Epyx]] in 1984 for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and [[Commodore 64]].<ref>{{lemon64 game|id=2025|name=Puzzle Panic}}</ref>

The player guides Benny, a [[light bulb]], through a series of 11 puzzles, each with varying difficulty settings (a total of over 40 levels). At the completion of each level, there are a few available exits, each bearing an obscure symbol, which take Benny forward or back in the game (or possibly to repeat the level). The final level, the "Metasequence," is a cryptic puzzle with a non-explicit objective. Its original purpose was part of a contest: those who solved it correctly by the August 13, 1984 deadline<ref name=panak/> could enter in a drawing to win a weekend at an [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] [[casino]] with co-creator [[Ken Uston]].

==Development==
A pre-release version of the game was called ''PuzzleMania''.<ref>{{cite web|title=PuzzleMania|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-puzzlemania_4190.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref>

==Reception==
Steve Panak wrote in ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'', "''Puzzle Panic'' is so radically different, so unlike anything else you've ever set your cathode-raybloodshot eyes on, that there's no readily memorable program to compare it with," and called the game "addictive." He disliked the brief window for winning the contest; it had already expired by the time he played.<ref name=panak/>

Fred Pinho wrote in ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'': {{quote|''Puzzle Panic'' is a nice blend of puzzle solving, strategy and arcade action.  The puzzles are nowhere as frustrating as the typical adventure game.  Neither are the arcade segments as demanding as the typical shoot-em-up.  For those not gifted with the joystick touch (the majority of us), this game will give a sense of accomplishment since every screen is conquerable.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pinho |first1=Fred |title=Product Reviews: Puzzle Panic |journal=Antic |date=December 1984 |volume=3 |issue=8 |url=https://www.atarimagazines.com/v3n8/productreviews.html}}</ref>}}
