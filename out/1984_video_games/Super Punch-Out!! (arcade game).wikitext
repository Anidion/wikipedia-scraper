The sequel to ''[[Punch-Out!! (arcade game)|Punch-Out!!]]'', it follows the same format while adding several new features and characters. Along with punching, blocking and dodging, players also have the ability to duck. The game also [[Saved game|saves]] and displays the three fastest [[knockout]] times, while the game's difficulty is increased.<ref name="Horowitz"/>

It introduces a number of new characters to the [[Punch-Out!!|''Punch-Out!!'' series]], including [[List of Punch-Out!! boxers#Bear Hugger|Bear Hugger]], [[Dragon Chan]], [[Vodka Drunkenski]] (whose name was changed to Soda Popinski in later releases), [[Great Tiger]], and [[Super Macho Man]].

==Gameplay==
{{See also|List of Punch-Out!! characters}}
[[Image:Arcade macho.png|left|thumb|The final match against Super Macho Man]]

As in the original ''Punch-Out!!'', the player assumes the role of a green-haired boxer (later recast as [[Little Mac]] in the 1987 [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version),<ref name=Miiverse>[https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHkNotf5VQ One of the Origin/Game Settings Tips about Little Mac's origin and All-Star Mode for ''Super Smash bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U'' reveals that Little Mac was actually debut in the 1984 ''Punch-Out!!'' arcade]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> known by three initials, who works through the ranks of the WVBA (World Video Boxing Association).  During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from the rear as a [[Wire-frame model|wireframe]] so the opponents are visible to the player. The player must precisely time punches, dodges, and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer. Hints are given as to the opponent's next move by subtle eye changes, but the player must ultimately predict what moves the opponent will make and react appropriately. Mostly, the opponent's eyes turn yellow before attacking, as well as winding up. Like in the previous arcade game, if the player loses, the opponent will glide up and laugh, with their stun animation and their neutral animation being reused.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A rom site |url=https://retrogames.cc/arcade/punch-out!! }}</ref>

Once the player defeats the final opponent, the player will win the Heavyweight Belt, then defend it against the same characters that have already been beaten. Each successive time they are met, the opponents are harder and quicker. In order to win a bout, the player must [[Knockout|knock out]] the opponent within one 3-minute round; failure to do so results in an automatic loss. A [[technical knockout]] is awarded if either fighter is knocked down three times, but the opponent will sometimes fail to rise after the first or second knockdown.

The arcade game is housed in a modified [[Arcade cabinet#Upright cabinets|upright cabinet]]. Like the previous game, it requires two vertically stacked [[Computer display|monitors]]. The top monitor is used to display statistics while the bottom one is the main game display. It is otherwise a standard upright arcade cabinet.  It has a [[joystick]] and three buttons. Two buttons control left and right punches, one for each arm. One button delivers a strong [[uppercut]] or right hook, but it only works when the super meter (also known as the KO meter or power meter) is full. The super meter (an early version of the ''super meter'' used in modern [[fighting games]]) is filled by landing successful punches. It is drained when the player fails to block or dodge an attack, or if the player is knocked down. Unlike the original, ''Super Punch Out!!'' also features a joystick which can be pulled straight up from the panel, allowing the player to duck opponents' punches.

== Development ==
The game was developed by [[Nintendo R&D3]], with development led by [[Genyo Takeda]]. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], due to his increasing responsibilities with the [[Famicom]], had a smaller role for the sequel, aiding artists with their concept images. Takeda held brainstorming sessions with R&D3 on how to improve on ''Punch-Out'', but initially had difficulties coming up with ideas within the rules of [[boxing]]. Takeda said they "did everything we could do with boxing," so the "only thing we could do was to include illegal moves, and that's why we made it so anything goes and had characters who would kick or were like [[martial artists]], and that became ''Super Punch-Out!!''"<ref name="Horowitz">{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=Beyond Donkey Kong: A History of Nintendo Arcade Games |date=6 August 2020 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-8420-8 |pages=144–5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3D0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA144}}</ref>

== Reception ==
In Japan, ''Game Machine'' listed ''Super Punch-Out!!'' on their November 15, 1984 issue as being the third most-successful upright arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - アップライト, コックピット型TVゲーム機 (Upright/Cockpit Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=248|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 November 1984|page=25|lang=ja}}</ref>

In the United States, the U.S. National Video Game Team selected ''Super Punch-Out'' as the best game at the AMOA Expo show in October 1984, and as one of the six games to be played in the 1985 national video games competition. Team member Phil Britt said the "inclusion of world records and the increased difficulty make it more" playable.<ref name="Horowitz"/>

It was developed and published by [[Elite Systems]] exclusively in [[Europe]]. Instead of the nameable wireframe boxer, real-life boxer [[Frank Bruno]] stars as the protagonist of the game. Only the first three opponents of the ''Super Punch-Out!!'' arcade are included in the game; however, their names were changed. Bear Hugger was renamed "Canadian Crusher", Dragon Chan was renamed "Fling Long Chop", and [[Vodka Drunkenski]] was renamed "Andra Puncharedov". Five exclusive characters were added to the game: Tribal Trouble, Frenchie France, Raviolo Mafiosi, Antipodean Andy, and Peter Perfect. Like ''Super Punch-Out'', it features a KO meter, allowing a more powerful punch to be thrown when the bar is filled.<ref name="crashrev" />

''Frank Bruno's Boxing'' was the sixth best-selling [[1985 in video games|home video game of 1985]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=News Desk: Exploding Fist tops Gallup 1985 charts |magazine=[[Popular Computing Weekly]] |date=20 March 1986 |page=4 |url=https://archive.org/details/popular-computing-weekly-1986-03-20/page/n3}}</ref> Elite Systems later re-released the game as ''Frank Bruno's World Championship Boxing'' on their Encore budget label to coincide with the [[Mike Tyson vs. Frank Bruno]] bout of 1989.

===Others===
Great Tiger, Super Macho Man, and Vodka Drunkenski appear in the 1987 [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version of ''[[Punch-Out!! (NES)|Punch-Out!!]]''. Vodka Drunkenski was renamed "Soda Popinski" in order to eliminate alcohol references in a family-oriented game.

The ''Super Punch-Out!!'' arcade inspired the development and release of ''[[Super Punch-Out!!]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] console in 1994.  Several elements were slightly changed for this version. Characters from both ''Punch Out!!'' arcade games are featured in the game with basically the same looks and attacks. including Bear Hugger, Dragon Chan, and Super Macho Man.

As in the original ''Punch-Out!!'' arcade, [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], and [[Donkey Kong Jr.|Donkey Kong Junior]] all appear in the audience part of the ''Super Punch-Out!!'' arcade. Also, one of the victory tunes heard in the ''Super Punch-Out!!'' arcade was later used in Nintendo's 1985 ''[[Baseball (1983 video game)|Baseball]]'' for the NES as the home run theme.

As part of the [[Hamster Corporation|HAMSTER Corporation]]'s [[Arcade Archives]] series, ''Super Punch-Out!!'' was released on [[Nintendo Switch]] on August 14, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arcade Archives SUPER PUNCH-OUT!! for Nintendo Switch - Nintendo Official Site |url=https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/arcade-archives-super-punch-out-switch/ |access-date=2024-06-13 |website=www.nintendo.com |language=en-US}}</ref>
