'''''B.C. Bill''''' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Action game|action]] video game published by [[Imagine Software]] in 1984.<ref name="WoS"/> It was released for the [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[TRS-80 Color Computer]], [[Dragon 32/64]] and [[BBC Micro]].<ref name="MobyGames">{{cite web|title=B.C.

==Gameplay==
The player controls the [[eponym]]ous B.C. Bill, a [[caveman]], and must gather wives and enough food to feed his growing family, while avoiding predatory dinosaurs. Bill is armed with a [[club (weapon)|club]], which he uses to stun cavewomen and to kill a variety of roaming creatures. Smaller creatures may be dragged back to the cave as food, whereas larger dinosaurs will eat potential wives and food, and will kill Bill on contact. Bill can die from a broken heart if too many wives leave the cave, and from starvation if he is unable to provide enough food to feed himself and his family.<ref name="YSReview" /><ref name="Retrogamer">{{cite web |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/b-c-bill/ |title=B.C.

The seasons change, which affect the number and variety of food animals and also act as an internal gameplay timer: in spring, every wife who has food will produce a child, while in autumn any wife with no food will die and any child with no food will leave home.<ref name="CVG">{{cite journal |title=B.C.

==Development==
B.C. Bill was developed in the UK by [[Creative Technology Group]], and was published in the UK by Imagine Software in 1984 and in Spain by ABC Soft. Versions of the game were developed and released for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, TRS-80, Dragon 32/64 and BBC Micro [[home computer]]s.

The game was the last title published by Imagine, which was [[liquidation|wound up]] in July 1984 due to unpaid debts of Â£10,000.<ref name=PCW19Jul84>{{cite news| title=Imagine in hands of receiver| date=19 July 1984| url=http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/8bitgamer/?cat=39| work=[[Popular Computing Weekly]]| access-date=9 August 2018| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028125837/http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/8bitgamer/?cat=39| archive-date=28 October 2008}}</ref> Prior to the company's collapse [[Beau Jolly]] acquired the rights to market Imagine's games,<ref name="CrashNewsAug84">{{cite web |url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/07/news.htm |title=The Bubble Bursts |date=August 1984 |website=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash Online]] |access-date=9 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118201900/http://www.crashonline.org.uk/07/news.htm |archive-date=18 January 2018 }}</ref> so after the company's demise Beau Jolly took over marketing and distribution of B.C.

The game received generally favourable reviews at release, with reviewers variously praising its graphics, sound and [[gameplay|playability]].<ref name="YSReview" /><ref name="CVG" /><ref name="Crash" /> Looking back at the game in 2010, however, [[Retro Gamer]] described it as "an exceedingly poor game".<ref name="Retrogamer" />

While reviewers praised the gameplay, the game has been criticised by both contemporary and modern reviewers for its [[Sexism|sexist]] subject matter, as a core element of gameplay involves the protagonist clubbing women and then dragging them by the hair into his cave to become his wife.<ref name="YSReview" /><ref name="Retrogamer" /><ref name="Crash" /> ''[[Your Sinclair|Your Sinclair's]]'' (then ''Your Spectrum'') Ron Smith speculated that this might have been deliberate on the part of Imagine, and Imagine's Tim Best appeared to confirm this, saying that he expected the "[[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|Greenham Common women]]" to take up residence outside Imagine's Liverpool offices.<ref name="YSPreview">{{cite journal |title=Rumbles: Imagine gets chauvinist |last=Smith |first=Ron |journal=[[Your Sinclair]] |issue=5  |date=July 1984 |page=56 |url=https://archive.org/stream/your-spectrum-magazine-05/YourSpectrum_05_Jul_1984#page/n57}}</ref>
