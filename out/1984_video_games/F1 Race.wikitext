{{nihongo foot|'''''F1 Race'''''|F1レース|F1 Rēsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[racing video game|racing]] [[video game]] developed by [[HAL Laboratory]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in 1984. A version was released in 1990 for the [[Game Boy]] in Japan and in 1991 in Europe and North America, including the [[Game Link Cable#First generation|Four Player Adapter]] for four-player gameplay.

==Gameplay==
[[File:F1_Race_game_screenshot.png|thumb|left|In the Famicom version, the player prepares to turn a corner.]]
The game features [[auto racing|racing]] in one of two [[Formula One]] cars on a variety of tracks in landmark scenery. On Famicom, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.<ref>[http://www.retrogamezone.co.uk/f1race.htm Images of ''F-1 Race'' for the Family Computer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221000054/https://retrogamezone.co.uk/f1race.htm |date=2016-12-21}} at Retro Game Zone</ref>

Famicom gameplay is similar to that of [[Namco]]'s ''[[Pole Position (video game)|Pole Position]]''. The player must finish 2 laps of each course within the time limit in order to progress to the next. Points are scored based on the distance the car travels, with the goal being to gain a high score. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a "LOW" setting and a "HI" setting).<ref name="xrea">[http://famicon.s348.xrea.com/entries/19841102_f1race/ Basic game summary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806021919/http://famicon.s348.xrea.com/entries/19841102_f1race/ |date=2017-08-06}} at Xrea</ref> A time extension is granted after completing the first lap of each course. The game has 3 skill levels, with each skill level having a set of 5 tracks, where the tracks in skill level 1 are the simplest, and the tracks in skill level 3 are the most complex. On the fifth track of each skill level, the race will never end, no matter how many laps the player completes, and the time extension granted with each lap completion diminishes, eventually forcing a game over. When the player's car come into contact with other cars racing on the track, or with objects off the side of the road, it will be destroyed and respawn, usually losing several seconds. Additionally, the player must be careful on bends, as if the car is going too fast, it will skid on them, forcing the car towards the outside of the bend and will potentially cause a crash or run off the road.

Several Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits for the Game Boy version: [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Princess Peach]], [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], [[Samus Aran|Samus]], [[Pit (Kid Icarus)|Pit]] and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]]. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring ''[[Famicom Grand Prix#Famicom Grand Prix: F1 Race|Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race]]'' and ''[[Famicom Grand Prix#Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally|Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally]]''. Similar to the original, both games were never released outside Japan.

The Game Boy version has different gameplay, with longer race tracks set in different countries and new driving mechanics, and different game modes. The player can activate a temporary speed boost by holding up on the D-pad, replacing the low-high gear setting from the Famicom version. [[Powersliding]] is activated by continuing to hold left or right at sharp corners. Unlike the Famicom version, colliding with other cars does not destroy the player's car and hitting an obstacle simply makes the car spin out.

==Development and release==
[[HAL Laboratory]] developed ''F1 Race'', in a small team led by [[Satoru Iwata]].<ref>{{cite web |title=『スーパーマリオ』が完成しても |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/smnj/vol2/index6.html |website=[[Nintendo]] |access-date=11 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331154328/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/smnj/vol2/index6.html |archive-date=31 March 2019 |date=2009 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Shmuplations">{{cite web |title=Satoru Iwata - 1999 Developer Interview |url=http://shmuplations.com/iwata/ |website=Shmuplations |access-date=11 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914133304/http://shmuplations.com/iwata/ |archive-date=14 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Production began shortly after the completion of ''[[Golf (1984 video game)|Golf]]'', and lasted alongside several other Famicom games such as ''[[Pinball (1984 video game)|Pinball]]'', ''[[Mach Rider]]'', and ''[[Balloon Fight]]''.<ref name="Iwata Asks">{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks - Mario Kart Wii - It Started With A Guy In Overalls |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/mariokart/0/0 |website=[[Nintendo]] |access-date=11 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191130152303/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/mariokart/0/0 |archive-date=30 November 2019 |date=2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> In a 1999 interview with ''Used Games'' magazine, Iwata recalled production being a challenge, as the first Famicom game with raster scrolling, a feature not built into the system and so programmed from scratch.<ref name="Shmuplations"/> It was developed based on Iwata's personal love for racing games, which influenced later [[Nintendo]] projects such as the ''[[F-Zero]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series.<ref name="Iwata Asks"/> It was published by [[Nintendo]] and released in Japan on November 2, 1984.

A [[Game Boy]] version of ''F1 Race'' was published in Japan on November 9, 1990, in North America on February 3, 1991, and in Europe on October 10 of the same year. It was developed by [[Nintendo Research & Development 1]] (R&D1) and designed by Naotaka Onishi, with music by Ryo Yoshiyoshi Ninohe and programming by Kenji Imai. Renamed ''F-1 Race'', it allows for four-person multiplayer via the [[Game Link Cable|Game Boy Four Player Adapter]].
