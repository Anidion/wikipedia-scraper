'''''Seastalker''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] game written by Stu Galley and [[James Duncan Lawrence (author)|Jim Lawrence]]<ref name="giantlist"/> and published by [[Infocom]] in 1984. It was released simultaneously for several popular computer platforms of the time, such as the [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II series|Apple II]], and [[IBM PC compatible]]s (as a [[self-booting disk]]). The game was marketed as an introduction to interactive fiction for preteen players, having difficulty rating of "Junior." It was the only game to ever use this rating, which was replaced by the "Introductory" label given to games such as ''[[Wishbringer]]''. It is Infocom's twelfth game.

Galley and Lawrence later wrote ''[[Moonmist]]'' for Infocom.<ref name="giantlist"/>

==Plot==
The player's character is a young inventor and marine scientist. A research facility called the Aquadome issues a call for help, indicating that the undersea structure is being attacked by a sea monster. With helpful assistant Tip, the player must navigate to the Aquadome in the new untested two-person [[submarine]] ''Scimitar'' and investigate the problem. But that isn't all... it looks like there may be a [[saboteur]] within the Aquadome as well.

The game has 30 locations.<ref>[http://www.if-legends.org/~pdd/infocom/fact-sheet.txt Infocom Fact Sheet], Section VI, Game Statistics</ref>

==Release==
The package includes the following physical items:
#A logbook for the ''Scimitar'', including a letter from "[[President of the United States|The President]]" congratulating the player on acceptance into the Discovery Squad
#Four double-sided "top secret Infocards", containing hints printed in blue ink beneath a pattern of red ink
#A decoder featuring a small square of red plastic to reveal the hints on the Infocards
#A nautical chart of Frobton Bay for navigation
#A "Discovery Squad "badge" sticker

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' noted ''Seastalker''{{'}}s easiness, recommending it only as a beginner's text adventure, particularly for young kids. Exemplifying this are the numerous tips dropped by both in-game characters and the game itself, directing the player to the included Infocards. The review complained of minor inconsistencies like items that could not be interacted with until an in-game character told the player of its existence.<ref name="CGW">{{cite magazine | last = Fitzgibbons | first = Patricia | url = http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_4.5.pdf | title = Micro-Reviews: Seastalker | magazine = [[Computer Gaming World]] | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | date = October 1984 | page = 38 | accessdate = 21 February 2017}}</ref>

''[[PC Magazine]]'' gave ''Seastalker'' 10.0 points out of 12. It also noted the game's relatively low difficulty level, praised the prose, and stated, "I enjoyed myself immensely".<ref name="wiswell19841030">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58pZmMUUxWQC&pg=PA273 | title=Trolls and Snarks | work=PC Magazine | date=1984-10-30 | accessdate=25 October 2013 | author=Wiswell, Phil | page=273}}</ref>
