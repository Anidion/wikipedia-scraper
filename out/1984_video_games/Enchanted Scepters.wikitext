[[Image:Enchanted-Scepters-Opening-.png|thumb|left|Opening screen]]'''''Enchanted Scepters''''' is a [[Graphic adventure game#Point-and-click adventure games|point-and-click adventure game]], released in 1984.<ref>{{cite book | author=Craig Glenday | title=Guinness World Records 2009 | publisher=Guinness World Records Limited | location=London | date=2009 | isbn=9781904994473 | url= |page=58}}</ref>

The player must find the four fire, earth, air and water scepters hidden across the Kingdom, and return them to the Wizard. The gameplay is much like a [[text adventure game]]; the screen shows a picture of the room the player is currently in and to the right is a description of the room. The description mentions any items that can be used or picked up, but to do that the player must click on the item in the picture. The pictures change as the player moves to a new scene. There is no movement in the picture, but enemies are inserted when encountered, accompanied by sound effects. The player can then choose from a drop down menu whether to flee, and which way (north, south, east or west and occasionally up or down), or to fight, and with which weapon.

''Enchanted Scepters'' was created with the [[World Builder]] adventure authoring system which was later released to consumers in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Legacy==
In 1990, a [[fangame]] titled ''[[Lost Crystal]]'' was released that was also developed using the ''World Builder'' engine and that took up the plot of ''Enchanted Scepters''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}
