''II Computing'' in 1985 called the Apple II version of ''Carriers at War'' "the best-playing simulation of naval warfare I have seen on either tabletop or video monitor" and favorably citing its historical accuracy.<ref name="shapiro198510_11">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/II_Computing_Vol_1_No_1_Oct_Nov_85_Premiere#page/n25/mode/2up | title=Of Jewels and Ghouls and Butterflies and Strategies of War | work=II Computing | date=October–November 1985 | accessdate=28 January 2015 | author=Shapiro, Neil | pages=24–26}}</ref> ''inCider'' was less positive, rating the Apple II version two stars in 1986. The reviewer stated that the game "is so difficult to master, it takes much of the joy out of playing it ... Carriers' big drawback is its complexity", adding that he preferred [[Gary Grigsby]]'s [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.|SSI]] naval games as "they're less flexible, but they're just as detailed and much more playable".<ref name="murphy198609">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/inCider_1986-09#page/n111/mode/2up | title=Game Room | work=inCider | date=December 1986 | accessdate=2 July 2014 | author=Murphy, Brian J. | pages=113–114}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that "Carriers at War is the best game available on World War II carrier operations.
