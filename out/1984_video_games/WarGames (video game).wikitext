'''''WarGames''''' is a [[strategy video game]] developed by [[Coleco]] for the [[ColecoVision]] and published in 1984. It was [[porting|ported]] to the 
[[Atari 8-bit computers]] and [[Commodore 64]]. The game's goal is to defend the [[United States]] against nuclear attack, much in the style of a less frantic ''[[Missile Command]]''. The principal [[game designer|designer]] was Coleco staffer Joseph Angiolillo.<ref name="Jaquays Price List">Jaquays, Paul.

Joseph Angiolillo presented a one-hour seminar on the creation of WarGames at the August 2011 Board Game Players Convention in Lancaster, PA where he showed a DVD of his creation process and memos and lists from Coleco showing the designers of each Coleco product.

The game was directly inspired by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM's]] [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[WarGames]]'', but instead of depicting the film's events, it adapts its iconic [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] scene into playable form.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:Wargames.gif|frame|right|The initial [[Defense Readiness Condition|DEFCON]] for each sector is 5.]]
As the game begins, the iconic line "Greetings Professor Falken:" appears on the screen, quickly followed by, in a box: "Select a Challenge Level from 1 to 8 for Global Thermonuclear War". After the skill level has been chosen, the main game screen appears.

The continental [[United States]] is divided into six sectors, each with its own bases and major cities. [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]s and bombers rain over the North Pole, while submarines inch toward coasts. Defenses consist of [[Anti-ballistic missile|ABM]]s, [[interceptor aircraft]], submarines and an experimental [[Strategic Defense Initiative|particle beam satellite]] that trumps everything else but weaves in and out of sectors on a fixed orbit. US units are individually far superior, but vulnerable to the destruction of interceptor and missile bases. Events proceed in real time in all sectors as defenses gradually crumble.

Enemy presence and the destruction of bases and cities lower a sector's [[Defense Condition]] (DEFCON) status. The DEFCON level for each sector is factored into the total DEFCON status. If it stays at 1 for 60 successive seconds, or if at any time all cities and bases have been destroyed, an automated counterstrike triggers global thermonuclear war and loses the game. The game is won by preventing a counterstrike long enough for a cease-fire to be reached. With eight difficulty levels, one game takes approximately four to eight minutes.

The game is visually stark and technical by 1984 standards. As in the original movie, the manual hints that the attack is an imagined result of a computer glitch; the counterstrike is not.
