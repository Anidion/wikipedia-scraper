{{nihongo foot|'''''Pinball'''''|ピンボール|Pinbōru|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[pinball]] [[video game]] developed by [[Nintendo]] and [[HAL Laboratory]] and published by Nintendo for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It is based on a [[Game & Watch]] unit of the same name, and was first released for the Famicom in Japan in 1984. It was later released as an [[arcade game]] for the [[Nintendo VS. System]] in Japan and North America in 1984. In 1985, it was a [[launch game]] for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America.

==Gameplay==
The player controls the paddles of a virtual [[pinball machine]]. Two [[electronic page|screens]] represent the traditional pinball table plus a bonus mode. The player launches a ball with the [[plunger (pinball)|plunger]] from the first screen—the bottom of the pinball table—through the top of the screen to the second screen. Play moves to the first screen if the ball falls through the bottom of the top screen and returns to the top screen if the ball is hit back through the space at the top of the first screen. The player controls the [[flipper (pinball)|flipper]]s on either screen to deflect the ball to keep it from falling off the bottom of the lower screen.

''Pinball'' has a secondary ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]''-like mode, which the player reaches by hitting the ball into a bonus hole that takes the player to a bonus stage to control [[Mario]] carrying a platform. The object of this mode is to rescue [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Pauline]] who had debuted with Mario in ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' (1981). The player achieves this by bouncing the ball off Mario's platform and hitting various targets, the destruction of which also earns points. When the blocks under her are all gone, she will drop. Catching her on Mario's platform earns bonus points, but allowing her to hit the ground causes the player to lose.

==Re-releases==
''Pinball'' was re-released on NES in 1985, and for the [[Family Computer Disk System]] on May 30, 1989.

The game is [[Unlockable (video games)|unlockable]] within the 2001 games ''Dōbutsu no Mori'' for Nintendo 64 and ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'' for GameCube. The latter can be played on a [[Game Boy Advance]] via a [[GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable|link cable]]. In 2002, ''Pinball'' was re-released for the [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] on the Game Boy Advance.

''Pinball'' was released on [[Virtual Console]] for the [[Wii]] on November 19, 2006 in North America, December 2 in Japan, and December 15 in [[PAL region]], and on [[Wii U]] on October 24, 2013. It was released on [[Nintendo Switch Online]] on May 26, 2022.

Pinball'' in its October 1, 1984 issue as being the twenty-fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=245|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=1 October 1984|page=35|lang=ja}}</ref>
