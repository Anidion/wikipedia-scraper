{{nihongo foot|'''''Vulgus'''''|バルガス|Barugasu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] video game developed and published by [[Capcom]] in Japan in 1984 and released in North America by [[SNK Playmore|SNK]] the same year. The game was [[Capcom]]'s first video game. The game is included in ''[[Capcom Classics Collection]]'' and is available as [[freeware]].<ref name=geek>{{Cite web |url=https://www.geek.com/blurb/capcom-gives-away-vulgus-for-free-550460/ |title=Capcom gives away Vulgus for free - Geek.com |access-date=2017-06-12 |archive-date=2018-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227050856/https://www.geek.com/blurb/capcom-gives-away-vulgus-for-free-550460/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

A [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] sequel was developed but never released, but a playable finished ROM has surfaced online since its cancellation.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a spaceship with a single objective: destroy incoming enemies. The vessel has two different weapons: a primary weapon with infinite ammunition and a limited supply of bombs. By picking up the "Pow" icons, which sporadically appear throughout the levels, the player can replenish supplies. Similar to ''[[Xevious]]'', the game does not have distinct levels; the background alternates between the surface of a planet and a space field. The game repeats with increased difficulty until the player loses all of their lives.

==Reception==
According to ''Game Machine'', ''Vulgus'' was among the most popular arcade games in Japan during June 1984.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos) |magazine=Game Machine |issue=238 |publisher=Amusement Press |date=15 June 1984 |page=25 |lang=ja}}</ref>

In ''[[Play Meter]]'' magazine, Roger C. Sharpe gave it a generally favorable review and rated it three [[Number sign|hashes]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Sharpe |first=Roger C. |title=Critic's Corner |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |date=December 1, 1984 |volume=10 |issue=22 |pages=83–7 |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-10-number-22-december-1st-1984/Play%20Meter%20-%20Volume%2010%2C%20Number%2022%20-%20December%201st%201984/page/83}}</ref>

==Legacy==
A follow-up game, ''Titan Warriors'', originally known as ''Neo Vulgus'', was in development for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but went unreleased. In 2001, Capcom released ''Vulgus'' as freeware for IBM PCs and PDAs.<ref name=geek/> ''Vulgus'' is available in the compilation title ''[[Capcom Generation 3]]'' for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]]. The game was also included in the 2005 ''[[Capcom Classics Collection]]'' for the Sony [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], in ''[[Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and as a bonus game at ''[[Capcom Arcade Cabinet]]''.

The Pow icon is re-used in many other Capcom games, like ''[[1941: Counter Attack]]'', ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]'' and ''[[Exed Exes]]''. Likewise, the Yashichi enemy has made later appearances in many Capcom games, usually in a more benign role as a power-up. [[List of Power Stone characters#Valgas|Valgas]], a boss character from the ''[[Power Stone (video game)|Power Stone]]'' series, has his name based on this game.

In ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', [[Deadpool]] reveals that he is petitioning for Capcom to make ''Vulgus 2''.
