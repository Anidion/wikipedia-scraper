The objective of the game is to successfully travel from point to point while utilizing the map. There are three levels of difficulty.

==Plot==
''Jenny's Journeys'' takes place in the fictional town of Lake City. Players control Jenny, the protagonist of the game, while being accompanied by 'Aunt Jenny'. Players can access Aunt Jenny's car to drive around Lake City, transport [[non-player characters]] ([[Non-player character|NPCs]]), and input street intersections to receive directions while referencing the map. Players are challenged to identify their location on a map based on their surroundings, identify a destination from an address, and plot a route across town while managing their gas. On the hardest difficulty, there are multiple stops and occasional detours.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jenny's Journeys |url=https://archive.org/details/a2_Jennys_Journeys_v1.0_1984_MECC_US |via=archive.org |date=1984 |publisher=Minnesota Educational Computing Corporation}}</ref>
