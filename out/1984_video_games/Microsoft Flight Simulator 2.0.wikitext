In May 1984, [[Microsoft]] released their version 2 (v2.10)<ref name="auto1"/> for [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PCs]]. This version made small improvements to the original version, including the graphics and a more precise simulation in general. It added [[joystick]] and [[Computer mouse|mouse]] input, as well as support for [[RGB monitor|RGB]] (4-color [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA graphics]]) and composite monitors<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/pcworld512unse|title=PC World Dec. 1987, p.209|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> and [[IBM PCjr]].

The new simulator expanded the scenery coverage to include a model of the entire [[United States]],<ref name="auto"/> although the airports were limited to the same areas as in ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0]]''.

Version 2.10a,<ref name="auto1"/> released in August 1984, added [[PC AT]] support and minor bug corrections.

Later versions (2.11,<ref name="auto1"/> unreleased and v2.12,<ref name="auto1"/><ref>{{Cite web |date=1985 |title=PC Mag 23 Jul 1985 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dwvc24nC0IQC&dq=%22%22Microsoft+Flight+Simulator+3%22&pg=PA53}}</ref> released in April 1985) fixed a no color problem on PCjr graphics, adding [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules graphics]] and [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] support.

Version 2.13,<ref name="auto1"/> released in August 1986, added support for [[IBM PC Convertible]], enhanced keyboard, [[3.5" inch floppy drive]]s, [[MS-DOS 3.2]] and laptop [[LCD]] displays.

Version 2.14,<ref name="auto1"/> released in June 1987 brought [[IBM PS/2]] support.

Over the next year or two, compatibility with [[Sublogic]] Scenery Disks was provided, gradually covering the whole U.S. (including [[Hawaii]]), [[Japan]], and part of [[Europe]].

Jason Durbin for ''[[PC World]]'' said of v. 2.13 "for the timid types who wouldn't be caught living or dead at 10,000 feet, ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' is an excellent way to enjoy the thrill of flight vicariously."<ref name="auto"/>
