==Gameplay==
The [[player character]] is an [[Stereotypes of indigenous people in North America|"Indian brave" stereotype]] who wears a tanned vest and trousers, and a headband with a feather. The player ascends a magical tree by hopping from branch to branch and climbing vines and ladders—while also dodging [[larva]]e, [[owl]]s, and [[Thunderbolt|lightning bolts]]. The player can jump and dangle from branches. He earns points by gathering apples, [[arrow]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[coronet]]s.

The tree is {{convert|2004|m|sp=us}} tall. A gauge tracks the player's altitude, and at the conclusion of each level the game informs the player how much further to climb to reach the goal: A castle on the treetop. The ascent is divided into nine [[game level]]s; the player character dances at the conclusion of each level.

When the player clears the ninth level, a curtain opens to reveal the castle at the top of the tree. Smiling from the [[crenel]]s of the castle's [[parapet]] are a young woman in a purple frock, and a man wearing a [[war bonnet]]. After the end sequence, the game then continues at the base of the tree.
