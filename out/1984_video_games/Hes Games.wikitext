'''''Hes Games''''' is a 1984 sports game released for the [[Commodore 64]] by [[HESware]].

It was originally developed by 3-2-1 Software for the [[Commodore 64|C64]] .  It was later upgraded by Michael Crick and released in the UK by Americana as '''''Go For The Gold''''' (#1 hit September 1986) and in the US by [[Cosmi Corporation|COSMI CORP]] under the label Celery Software. The US title, '''''World Games''''', was changed to  '''''Gold Medal Games'''''  to avoid confusion with an [[Epyx]] product also called ''[[World Games (video game)|World Games]]''.{{citation-needed|date=August 2016}}
