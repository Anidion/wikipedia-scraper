{{nihongo|'''''Ozma Wars'''''|オズマ・ウオーズ|Ozuma Uōzu}} is a [[fixed shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed by [[Shin Nihon Kikaku]] (SNK) and released in 1979. The moving starfield background gives the impression of vertical scrolling, but the player ship's movement is restricted to the bottom of the screen.<ref name=GameSpot>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-history-of-snk/1100-6089278/|title=The History of SNK|last=Provo|first=Frank|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=2004-06-11|access-date=2020-11-20}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[file:Ozma wars01.png|thumb|left|Four enemy ships (top) attacking the player (bottom center)]]

The player controls a spacecraft which must fend off UFOs, [[meteor]]s, and [[comet]]s. Instead of lives, the player is given an energy reserve that is constantly diminishing; getting hit by the enemy causes gameplay to stop momentarily and a large amount of energy is depleted. Every so often, a mothership will appear and dock with the player's spacecraft, allowing the energy to be refilled. There are 3–4 recognizable stages as the game progresses and new enemies begin to appear. After these, the mothership will appear, and the cycle starts over; this continues indefinitely until the energy reaches zero.

Due to the game being monochrome and a [[Glossary of video game terms#conversion kit|conversion kit]] for ''[[Space Invaders]]'', many ''Ozma Wars'' monitors used the ''Space Invaders'' color overlay.

==Legacy==
There are two bootleg versions of this game called ''Space Phantoms'' and ''Solar Flight''. In ''Space Phantoms'' the player's ship looks like an angel, and the enemies appear as different types of insect.
