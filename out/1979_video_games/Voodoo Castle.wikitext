It was available for the [[VIC-20]], the [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II series|Apple II]], and other contemporary computers.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay involves moving from location to location, picking up any objects found there, and using them somewhere else to unlock puzzles. Commands take the form of [[verb]] and [[noun]], e.g. "Climb Tree". Movement from location to location is limited to North, South, East, West, Up, and Down. There are limited graphics and the player must type in commands.

The goal is to wake up the [[Count Dracula]]-esque Count Cristo, who is lying in a coffin at the starting location in the game. In order to do so, the player needs to obtain certain items, which requires overcoming certain obstacles, such as an exploding test tubes and a doorway that's too small to pass through normally. The player must visit all 24 areas of the castle, and must use magic on voodoo items.
