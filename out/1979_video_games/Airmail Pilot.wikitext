Must be willing to fly in every type of weather. Only the foolhardy need apply." The player pilots a [[Curtiss JN-4]]D "Jenny" [[biplane]] carrying mail from [[Columbus, Ohio]] to [[Chicago]], via [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]].

==Reception==
Bruce Campbell reviewed ''Airmail Pilot'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 36.<ref name="SG">{{cite magazine |last=Campbell |first=Bruce |date=February 1981 |title=Capsule Reviews |url=https://archive.org/stream/space-gamer_201601/Space_Gamer_36#page/n27 |journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=36|pages=27}}</ref> Campbell commented that "If you are looking for a realistic airflight simulation, ''Airmail Pilot'' is not for you. Since its price is on the lower end of the software spectrum, I do recommend it for those looking for a quick, easy, enjoyable game with limited staying power."<ref name="SG"/> Another reviewer from ''[[Moves (magazine)|Moves]]'' commented, "It can be fun and amusing, but it is not designed to hold an adult's attention for very long."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chadwick |first=Ian |editor-last=Simonsen |editor-first=Redmond A. |date=April–May 1981 |title=Why I'm Really Buying a Microcomputer and What I'll Play When It Gets Here, Part 2 |url=https://archive.org/stream/Moves39/Moves%2056#page/n23/ |magazine=[[Moves (magazine)|Moves]] |publisher=Simulations Publications |location=New York, NY |issue=56 |pages=23–29 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>
