}}'''''Starhawk''''' is a 1979 [[Vector monitor|vector]] [[arcade game]] designed and programmed by [[Tim Skelly]] and manufactured by [[Cinematronics]].<ref name="giantlist"/> ''Starhawk'' is a [[shoot 'em up]] unofficially based on the ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV]]'' trench run, one of the first arcade games to blatantly use concepts from ''Star Wars''.<ref name="Retrovolve"/> The game was unique at the time for its [[pseudo-3D]] graphics. It was distributed in Japan by [[Sega]], and was later ported for the [[Vectrex]] home system in 1982.

The arcade cabinet had a [[cinder block]] placed inside of it, to prevent it from tipping onto the player.<ref name="Retrovolve">{{cite web|last1=Wirtanen|first1=Josh|title=The First Star Wars Arcade Game Wasn't Officially a Star Wars Game|url=http://retrovolve.com/the-first-star-wars-arcade-game-wasnt-officially-a-star-wars-game/|website=Retrovolve|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref>

==Plot==
According to the Vectrex manual, the story involves "protecting your comrades from alien ships trying to infiltrate your culture" and "defending the sovereignty of your planet."

==Gameplay==
Various ships, reminiscent of [[TIE fighter]]s, appear on the horizon of the trench and the player has to shoot them before they destroy the player's ship. The player is given initially sixty seconds, but additional twenty seconds is awarded for every 10,000 points scored. The player continues flying down the trench towards a target similar to the Star Wars [[Death Star]] target.  The game gets progressively more difficult as the player advances. Similar to the flying saucer from ''[[Space Invaders]]'', a command ship periodically appears and shoots at the player. If the command ship is not destroyed quickly, the player loses 800 points.

Besides the firing button, there are three buttons that control the speed of the crosshairs.

===Scoring===
* Command ship: 800
* Starship: 500
* Rocket: 300
* Missile: 100
* Bomber: 100

==Reception==
''Starhawk'' was the fifth highest-earning [[1979 in video games|arcade video game of 1979]] in the United States, below ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Football (1978 video game)|Football]]'', ''[[Sprint 2]]'' and ''[[Head On (video game)|Head On]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Video Games |journal=RePlay |date=November 1979}}</ref>
