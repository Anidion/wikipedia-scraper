''Sargon II'' was [[porting|ported]] to a variety of personal computers popular in the early 1980s.<ref name = '6809 Flex'>It was even ported to the 6809 variety of the [[FLEX (operating system)|FLEX]] operating system by Brian N.

''BYTE'' in 1980 estimated that ''Sargon II'' had a 1500 rating at the highest tournament-time difficulty level, and speculated that it was the best chess program for sale, including dedicated devices.<ref name="martellaro198012">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1980-12/1980_12_BYTE_05-12_Adventure#page/n115/mode/2up | title=Sargon II / An Improved Chess-Playing Program for the Apple II | work=BYTE | date=December 1980 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Martellaro, John | pages=114}}</ref>

==Reception==
J. Mishcon reviewed The Software Exchange's ''Sargon II'' for the TRS-80 and Apple II in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 32 (1980). Mishcon commented that "This effort stands strongly in the small group of programs that set industry standards. It is a competent computer opponent in the incredibly complex world of chess. Highly recommended for everyone short of the chess master".<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Mishcon|first=J. |date=October 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=32|pages=28}}</ref> John Martarello in ''BYTE'' that year stated "buy it. Sargon II is everything Sargon I should have been ... Nearly every deficiency of Sargon has been corrected". While vulnerable to the [[fried liver attack]] and other human strategies, and unable to recognize a two-king [[draw (chess)|draw]], ''Sargon II'' was the first computer program that he found able to [[trap (chess)|trap]] the opponent. Martarello concluded that the game "is about all we computer chess players could wish for".{{r|martellaro198012}} He also favorably reviewed the Sargon 2.5 for the Chafitz Modular Gaming System, stating that its faster performance and addition of pondering resulted in "small yet definite" chess improvement. Martarello nonetheless advised Sargon II owners to "wait for Sargon 3" because of the cost of the Chafitz system.<ref name="martellaro198101">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-01/1981_01_BYTE_06-01_Hand-held_Computers#page/n209/mode/2up | title=The Newest Sargon - 2.5 | work=BYTE | date=January 1981 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Martellaro, John | pages=208–212}}</ref>

''[[Ahoy!]]'' in 1984 stated that the VIC-20 version of ''Sargon II''{{'}}s "chess-playing capability is excellent" and a bargain compared to dedicated chess computers,<ref name="salm198403">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_03_1984-03_Ion_International_US#page/n47/mode/2up | title=VIC Game Buyer's Guide | work=Ahoy! | date=March 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Salm, Walter | pages=49}}</ref> and gave a similarly favorable review of the Commodore 64 version.<ref name="herring198409">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_09_1984-09_Ion_International_US#page/n37/mode/2up | title=Sargon II | work=Ahoy! | date=September 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Herring, Richard | pages=39–40}}</ref> ''The [[Addison-Wesley]] Book of Atari Software 1984'' gave the game an overall A− rating, stating that only ''[[Chess 7.0]]'' was superior on a microcomputer and concluding that it "is a very worthy opponent for any chess enthusiast".<ref name="aw1984">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/Atari_Software_1984#page/n39/mode/2up | title=The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software | publisher=Addison-Wesley | year=1984 | pages=40 | isbn=0-201-16454-X |editor1=Stanton, Jeffrey |editor2=Wells, Robert P. |editor3=Rochowansky, Sandra |editor4=Mellid, Michael }}</ref> [[Tim Harding (chess player)|Tim Harding]] in 1985 called ''Sargon II'' the first "halfway competent chess program" for home computers. He stated that "in early 1984 the VIC/Sargon II combination was still among the strongest home computer chess programs" despite its age, with "many features superior to today's weaker amateur programs".<ref name="harding1985">{{cite book | authorlink=Tim Harding (chess player) | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pECeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 | title=The New Chess Computer Book | publisher=Pergamon Press | author=Harding, T.

Ian Chadwick for ''[[Moves (magazine)|Moves]]'' issue #56 said that "If you want to see what the fuss is all about, and try your hand at a game which must be considered state-of-the-art in computer programming, then ''Sargon II'' is the programme to get."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://strategyandtacticspress.com/library-files/Moves%20Issue56.pdf|title=Moves.
