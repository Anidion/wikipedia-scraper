Most of the screen is a side view of the water with enemy submarines patrolling in it. The goal is to destroy as many submarines as possible by dropping explosives from either the left or right side of the ship while avoiding mines launched from these submarines.<ref name=SSM16>{{cite magazine |title=Preview: Die Hard Arcade|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=16 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=February 1997|page=24}}</ref> A [[mini-map]] at the bottom of the screen shows submarines coming from the sides, before they are visible.
