'''''Tail Gunner''''' is a [[monochrome]] [[Vector graphics|vector]] arcade game created by [[Vectorbeam]] in 1979. The premise of the game is that the player is the [[tailgunner]] of a large space ship. Enemy spacecraft attack the vessel in groups of three, and the player must aim a set of [[Reticle|crosshair]]s and shoot the enemies before they slip past the player's cannons. Because of the game's viewpoint, instead of appearing to fly into the starfield, the stars move toward the left and center of the screen.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XiM0ntMybNwC&pg=PA68|title=The Video Game Explosion: A History from PONG to Playstation and Beyond|isbn=9780313338687|last1=Wolf|first1=Mark J. P.|year=2008}}</ref>

In addition to shooting down the enemy ships, the player is also given limited use of a shield that can block ships from passing. The game ends when ten ships slip past the player's cannon. The game was sold as '''''Tail Gunner II''''' in a sit down cabinet<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mikesarcade.com/cgi-bin/spies.cgi?action=url&type=info&page=CineHistV2-0.txt|title=THE HISTORY OF CINEMATRONICS AND A DESCRIPTION OF THEIR VECTOR GAMES|quote=Tail Gunner came out in a sit-down version, Tail Gunner II.}}</ref> and its controls consisted of a single metal joystick with fire button integrated to the tip.

''Tail Gunner''{{'}}s sound card was more complicated than any Cinematronics/Vectorbeam game before it. The cabinet uses the monitor's [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] to translate input from the joystick, so other games cannot necessarily be mounted in a ''Tail Gunner'' cabinet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mikesarcade.com/cgi-bin/spies.cgi?action=url&type=info&page=CineHistV2-0.txt|title=THE HISTORY OF CINEMATRONICS AND A DESCRIPTION OF THEIR VECTOR GAMES}}</ref>
