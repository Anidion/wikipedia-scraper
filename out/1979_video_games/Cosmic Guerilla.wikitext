''Cosmic Guerilla'' is a two-dimensional [[shoot 'em up#Fixed shooters|fixed shooter]] game. The player takes control of a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen whose movement is limited to left and right, and must fire at the aliens above.<ref name="zxcomp"/> In contrast to ''Space Invaders'' the aliens are arranged in a single vertical line on each side of the screen,<ref name="sincuser"/> with their movement being towards the centre, one or more at a time, in an attempt to capture and remove the player's shields.<ref name="homecomp"/> The aliens cannot be hit by the player's shots until they begin to move, and the player may only fire one projectile at a time.<ref name="crash"/> Once a row of shields has been removed, one of the player's "[[Health (gaming)|lives]]", is exposed and able to be captured.<ref name="homecomp"/> Occasionally a very fast "mothership" will appear and traverse the screen just above the player dropping bombs.<ref name="crash"/>

There are six levels of difficulty<ref name="crash"/> along with four game modes<ref name="homecomp"/> allowing combinations of the regular game, bonus enemies, and faster aliens. There is also a two player mode where players take alternative turns.<ref name="homecomp"/>
