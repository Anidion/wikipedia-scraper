'''''Temple of Apshai''''' (also known as '''''Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai''''') is a [[dungeon crawl]] [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by Automated Simulations (later renamed to [[Epyx]]) in 1979. Originating on the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]], it was followed by several updated versions for other computers between 1980 and 1986.

''Temple of Apshai'' is considered one of the first graphical role-playing games for home computers,<ref name="scorpia199110"/> predating even the commercial release of [[Richard Garriott]]'s ''[[Akalabeth: World of Doom]]''. It was an enormous success for its era, selling 20,000 copies by the end of 1981,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thedoteaters.com/?bitstory=epyx |title=Epyx Journey| website=The Dot Eaters}}</ref> and 30,000 copies by 30 June 1982<ref name="cgw_1982"/> and remaining a best-seller for at least four years.<ref>''Personal Computing'', October 1986, p. 88</ref>

It was followed by several sequels and two expansions. The latter were bundled with the main game into the remake ''Temple of Apshai Trilogy'' in 1985. Games using the ''Apshai'' engine were collectively known as the ''[[Dunjonquest (series)|Dunjonquest]]'' series.

==Gameplay==

The player in ''Temple of Apshai'' assumes the role of an adventurer who explores the mysterious ruins of the Temple of Apshai. The [[player character]] investigates room after room of the [[dungeon crawl]] while seeking treasure and combatting monsters. Along the way, the player discovers powerful weapons and armor with which to overcome the Temple's inhabitants. The game consists of four dungeons with over 200 rooms in total and features 30 monster types.<ref name="epyx198005">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1980-05/1980_05_BYTE_05-05_Floppy_Disks#page/n223/mode/2up | title=Did you read about the Dungeonmaster who became so enchanted playing a real life version of Dungeons and Dragons that he disappeared for a month? | work=BYTE | date=May 1980 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | type=advertisement}}</ref>

''Temple of Apshai'' consists of two programs: the Innkeeper and the Dunjonmaster. The game starts with the Innkeeper and the choice to either generate a new character or input an existing one.<ref name="colsher198009"/> The game uses six base values taken from ''Dungeons & Dragons''<ref name="byte12-80">{{Cite journal|journal=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]|first=Jon|author-link=Jon|last=Freeman|date=December 1980|pages=186–190|title=Character Variation in Role-Playing Games}}</ref> Early tape versions of the game had no means to save progress. The player was prompted to write down all statistics when quitting the game and had to type them in when resuming play.<ref name="scorpia199110"/><ref name="lindsay1979fall"/> Later floppy versions fixed this by saving the status on the disk.<ref name="foulger198212"/> Weapons and armor are purchased in a shop, where it is possible to haggle with the shopkeeper for a discount. Character stats determine which items can be worn.<ref name="lindsay1979fall"/> Finally, the player chooses between four dungeons of increasing difficulty to enter the Dunjonmaster part.<ref name="colsher198009"/>

In the Dunjonmaster program, the screen is divided into a birds-eye view representation of the surroundings and a status summary for the character. Traps, treasures and secret doors are hidden inside the dungeons.<ref name="lindsay1979fall"/> ''Temple of Apshai'' uses a hybrid between a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games|turn-based]] and a real time combat system. A player's turn can be used to walk up to 9 steps in the direction the character is facing, turning towards either direction, trying to talk the monster out of the fight, or executing a number of different attacks. A bow and arrows can be used to attack enemies from afar. If the player doesn't make any input for a while, the enemies continue to move and attack in set intervals regardless.<ref name="lindsay1979fall"/> All actions decrease the player character's fatigue rating, depending on stats and carrying weight. When this value sinks below zero, the character cannot act anymore before resting.<ref name="manual79p16-17">{{cite book|title=Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai Book of Lore|publisher=[[Epyx|Automated Simulations]]|year=1979|pages=16–17}}</ref> The player gains experience points while adventuring, which raise a number of hidden statistics.<ref name="manual79p17">{{cite book|title=Dungeonquest: Temple of Apshai Book of Lore|publisher=[[Epyx|Automated Simulations]]|year=1979|page=17}}</ref>

''Temple of Apshai'' was the first computer role-playing game with room descriptions.{{r|scorpia199110}} Detailed descriptions of all the rooms in the game's manual complement the sparse graphics and provide vital information. Pen-and-paper games like ''Dungeons & Dragons'' frequently make use of verbal depictions given by dungeon masters to suggest to players what is of interest in a setting. Similarly, in ''Temple of Apshai'' the player matches an on-screen room number to its entry in the manual that accompanies the game. One sample entry reads: "The aroma of vanilla makes the senses reel and the floor of the room is covered with the shiny stuff previously observed. Bones lie scattered across the floor and the clicking sound grows fainter from within. Gems stud the south wall."<ref name="manual79pl15">{{cite book|title=Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai Book of Lore|publisher=[[Epyx|Automated Simulations]]|year=1979|page=L1-5}}</ref> A vanilla scent is used in the game to suggests the presence of Antmen, the dominant monster type in the temple.<ref name="lemurian">{{cite web| url = http://dangermuffy.blogspot.kr/2010/04/dunjonquest-temple-of-apshai.html| title = Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai | work = Lemurian Congress| first = Adam| last = Thornton| date = 20 April 2010 | accessdate = 2014-07-05}}</ref>

When beaten by a monster, the player character may be rescued by one of several non-player characters. Depending on the rescuer, a portion of the player's inventory is removed as payment.<ref name="foulger198212"/>

The game has no particular goal other than fighting monsters, collecting treasure<ref name="scorpia199110"/> and gaining experience points.<ref name="lindsay1979fall"/>

==Development and releases==

[[File:Temple of Apshai TRS-80 Screenshot.png|thumb|left|The TRS-80 version uses abstract graphics.]]

''Temple of Apshai'' was originally programmed by Jim Connelley, founder and president of Automated Simulations / Epyx Software, for [[TRS-80]] and Commodore PET, using [[BASIC]].<ref name="scorpia199110"/> The role-playing system, named ''Dunjonquest'' was designed by [[Jon Freeman (game designer)|Jon Freeman]], while the level design of the dungeons was provided by [[Jeffrey Johnson (game designer)|Jeff Johnson]] (''[[Roadwar 2000]]'').<ref name="manual79p2">{{cite book|title=Dungeonquest: Temple of Apshai Book of Lore|publisher=[[Epyx|Automated Simulations]]|year=1979|page=2}}</ref>

According to Connelley, his motivations to create ''Temple of Apshai'' were "the popularity of noncomputer role-playing games" and the opportunity "to create a graphics-oriented adventure game".<ref name="compute-gazette"/> Like most early computer RPGs, ''Temple of Apshai'' was influenced by ''Dungeons & Dragons''. Both Connelley and Freeman played ''Dungeons & Dragons'' in a group where Connelley acted as the [[Dungeon Master]].<ref name="dadgum">{{cite web| url = http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/FREEFALL.HTM| title = Free Fall Associates: Jon Freeman & Anne Westfall| work = Halcyon Days| first = James| last = Hague| accessdate = 2014-07-04}}</ref> An advertisement for ''Temple of Apshai'' called the game a "version of Dungeons and Dragons" and described Connelly as an experienced "Dungeon Master, running continuous D & D campaigns".<ref name="kb198001">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/kilobaudmagazine-1980-01/Kilobaud_Microcomputing_1980_January#page/n29/mode/2up | title=Is it Dungeons and Dragons or Dragons and Dungeons? | work=Kilobaud Microcomputing | date=January 1980 | accessdate=23 June 2014 | pages=31 | type=advertisement}}</ref> The game's documentation included instructions for importing [[pen-and-paper role-playing game]] [[player character]]s.<ref name="colsher198009"/>

''Temple of Apshai'' was first released in August 1979.<ref name="cgw_1982"/> The original release contained the program cassette and the manual in a plastic bag, an unusually professional packaging for the time.<ref name="lindsay1979fall"/> Early advertisements promoted versions for TRS-80 and Commodore PET,<ref name="epyx197911">{{cite news | title=Dunjonquest Presents The Temple of Apshai | work=BYTE | date=November 1979 | page=209| type=advertisement}}</ref> but a version for the Apple II followed in 1980.<ref name="kb198001"/> The TRS-80, Apple II, and PET versions were sold for $24.95 on cassette and $29.95 on disk.<ref name="epyx198005"/>

Early reviews of ''Temple of Apshai'' praised the game's graphics and unusual complexity, while criticizing long loading times and slow screen build-up for the dungeon graphics. ''[[Compute!]]'' stated that ''Temple of Apshai'' for the PET "is for anyone who is tired of simple 'video games' ... [it] is quite an experience". It advised readers to be aware that "this is a serious game. Be prepared to THINK".<ref name="lindsay1979fall">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1979-Fall-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_001_1979_Fall#page/n87/mode/2up | title=32K Programs Arrive: Fantasy Role Playing Game For The PET | work=Compute! | date=Fall 1979 | accessdate=25 October 2013 | author=Lindsay, Len | pages=86}}</ref> [[Jerry Pournelle]] in ''[[BYTE]]'' called it "an excellent real-time dungeon game",<ref name="pournelle198007">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1980-07/1980_07_BYTE_05-07_Computers_and_Education#page/n199/mode/2up | title=Omikron TRS-80 Boards, NEWDOS+, and Sundry Other Matters | work=BYTE | date=July 1980 | accessdate=October 18, 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=198}}</ref> and later reported that his sons had "nearly worn out the Dungeons of Apshai".<ref name="pournelle198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-06/1983_06_BYTE_08-06_16-Bit_Designs#page/n411/mode/2up | title=Zenith Z-100, Epson QX-10, Software Licensing, and the Software Piracy Problem | work=BYTE | date=June 1983 | accessdate=20 October 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | volume=8 | issue=6 | pages=411}}</ref> ''[[Kilobaud Microcomputing]]'' criticized the long load times, but liked the game's graphics and "excellent" documentation.<ref name="colsher198009">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/kilobaudmagazine-1980-09/Kilobaud_Microcomputing_1980_September#page/n103/mode/2up | title=Role-Playing Games Reviewed | work=Kilobaud Microcomputing | date=September 1980 | accessdate=23 June 2014 | author=Colsher, William L. | pages=106–108}}</ref> ''[[PC Magazine]]'' stated that the IBM PC version did not fully exploit the computer's graphics capability, but that players "will find excitement and entertainment ... it's certainly worth the silver to grab this game for the PC".
