'''''Pyramid 2000''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] game.<ref>[http://www.figmentfly.com/pyramid2000/pyramid.html Figmentfly.com]</ref> The game is an altered version of ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Colossal Cave]]'' that takes advantage of an Egyptian setting, re-theming some of the locations, objects, and puzzles. For instance, the "little bird" from Adventure is now a "bird statue" and the "clam" is a "sarcophagus."

==Development==
The system was written by Robert Arnstein using a custom [[p-code machine]] with 32 instructions. Unlike the [[Infocom]] [[z-machine]], this machine was specific to this game (e.g., command 13 asserted the player was carrying the emerald and only the emerald).<ref>{{cite web|title=Pyramid Code|url=http://computerarcheology.com/CoCo/Pyramid/Code.html#ScriptCommands|website=Computer Archeology|accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref>

==Reception==
It was panned by ''[[80 Micro]]'': "This game is yet another example of [[Radio Shack]]'s inability to deal with the consumer in a consumer's market... ''Pyramid'' suffers from the lack of a command word base... You can try typing <code>HELP</code>, but don't expect any."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Brian|first1=William|title=Pyramid|journal=80 Microcomputer|date=August 1980|page=21|url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1980-08|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref>
