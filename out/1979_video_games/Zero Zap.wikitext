'''''Zero Zap''''' is a video game programmed by Herb Schmitz for the TI-99/4 and [[TI-99/4A]] home computers and published by [[Milton Bradley Company]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Games at Home |journal=Vidiot |date=1982 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=36 |url=https://archive.org/details/Vidiot_Vol_1_No_1_1982-10_CREEM_Magazine_US/page/n33/mode/2up?q=Zero+Zap}}</ref> It is part of the Milton Bradley Gamevision series, which consists of seven cartridges: ''Connect Four'', ''Yahtzee'', ''Hangman'', ''Zero Zap'', ''Card Sharp'', ''Stratego'', and the Gamevision Demonstration Cartridge. These seven cartridges were the launch titles for the TI-99/4 in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zero Zap |url=https://www.videogamehouse.net/zerozapgv.html |website=Video Game House |access-date=October 26, 2021}}</ref> This would mark the first third party to actually release games for the TI-99/4 system. Milton Bradley was only planning on producing these cartridges for a short time period (about one year) before passing production over to Texas Instruments.<ref>{{cite web |title=TI-99/4 Home Computer Timeline |url=https://www.ti994.com/timeline/ |website=ti994.com |access-date=October 26, 2021}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Zero Zap'' is included in the 1984 book, ''The Best Texas Instruments Software'': "Zero Zap is colorful, fast-paced, and has excellent sound."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Starfire |first1=Brian |title=The Best Texas Instruments Software |date=1984 |publisher=Beekman House |isbn=0517424762 |page=145 |url=https://archive.org/details/tibook_the-best-texas-instruments-software/page/n145/mode/2up?q=Zero+Zap}}</ref>

In a retrospective look at the game, Issue 1 of ''Classic Gamer Magazine'' wrote,  "Moving on, we came across another lame Video-Pinball game. Zero Zap was for the TI-99/4A home computer.... Real pinball games, even the video-pinballs of the world are games of skill. Zero Zap is pure luck and utter garbage."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Traut |first1=Frank |title=Frank's Video-Pinball Palace |journal=Classic Gamer Magazine |date=1999 |issue=1 |pages=38â€“39 |url=https://archive.org/details/classic-gamer-magazine-001/page/n37/mode/2up?q=Zero+Zap}}</ref>
