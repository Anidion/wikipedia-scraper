Eight different modes of playing backgammon were included in the game, including "Acey deucey". A doubling cube was available in-game for use in gambling. The rolling of the dice and other gaming operations were controlled via the paddle/joystick. The game was playable in both single-player and two-player, competitive mode.<ref name="Classic Home Video Games" />

==Reception==
Contemporary reviewers were relatively positive about the game. In an October 1979 review, American computer magazine ''[[Creative Computing]]'' described the game as "excellent for someone learning Backgammon" and as "provid[ing] an interesting challenge to beginner to intermediate players".<ref name="Creative Computing">{{cite journal |last1=Ahl |first1=David H. |title=Atari Video Computer Cartridges - Backgammon |journal=Creative Computing Magazine |date=October 1979 |volume=5 |issue=10 |page=40 |url=https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1979-10/page/n43 |accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref> UK-based ''TV Gamer'' called it "fairly challenging" in one-player mode.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Backgammon |journal=TV Gamer |date=Autumn 1983 |issue=2 |page=20 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/magazines/tv_gamer/tv_gamer_autumn83.pdf |accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref>
