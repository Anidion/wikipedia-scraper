{{nihongo foot|'''''Space Fever'''''|スペースフィーバー|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1979 [[arcade game]] by [[Nintendo Research & Development 2|Nintendo R&D2]].

It was released in both [[monochrome]] and [[color]] versions. The [[gameplay]] is similar to ''[[Space Invaders]]'', which had been released by [[Taito]] in 1978. In America, the game was distributed by Far East Video.<ref>{{cite web | title = Space Fever arcade flyer | url = https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/flyers_video/nintendo/22433201.jpg | accessdate = 2021-08-19}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[File:Space Fever Game-A.PNG|left|thumb|Game-A mode]]

The gameplay of ''Space Fever'' is reminiscent of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' (1978), where the player controls a [[laser cannon]] situated at the bottom of the screen and must defeat waves of enemy aliens. The aliens are arranged in rows and slowly move to the edge of the screen, before descending and continuing in the opposite direction. As more aliens are defeated, they increase in speed. A [[UFO]] will occasionally appear towards the top of the screen, which can be shot down for bonus points. There are three game modes that change the way the aliens move; the first presents two formations of enemies that move in opposite directions, the second continuously adds additional rows of aliens, and the third is functionally identical to ''Space Invaders''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Space Fever advertising flyer |date=February 1979 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |location=Japan |language=ja}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Space Fever for Arcade (1979) |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/space-fever |access-date=2022-03-06 |website=MobyGames}}</ref>

==Development==
In the late 1970s, [[Nintendo|Nintendo Co., Ltd]] began shifting its focus away from its roots as a toy and playing card company towards the coin-operated entertainment market. Its decision was largely based on the [[1973 oil crisis]] increasing the manufacturing costs for toys, and its need to diversify itself if it wanted to remain profitable. Nintendo had previously designed several electro-mechanical shooting gallery machines, such as the ''[[Laser Clay Shooting System]]'' and ''[[Wild Gunman (video game)|Wild Gunman]]''.<ref name="Ultimate History">{{cite book|last=Kent |first=Steven L. |author-link=Steven L.

In the same month, [[Taito]] released ''[[Space Invaders]]'', which triggered a nationwide resurgence in its video game market. This led to several manufacturers, including Nintendo, creating similar "Invader-type" games to try and capitalize on its popularity. ''Space Fever'' was one of its attempts, and was developed by Nintendo's [[Nintendo Research & Development 2|Research & Development 2]] (R&D2) division.<ref name="Nikkei">{{cite news |title=Making the Famicom a Reality |url=https://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/making-the-famicom-a-reality/ |access-date=March 19, 2021 |agency=Nikkei Electronics |publisher=[[The Nikkei]] |date=September 12, 1994 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221224255/https://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/making-the-famicom-a-reality/ |archive-date=December 21, 2020}}</ref> Masayuki Uemura, the head of R&D2, led the development of the game.<ref name="Nikkei"/> The programming and circuit design was contracted out to [[Ikegami Tsushinki]], as were most of Nintendo's arcade games at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|last=McFerran|first=Damien|date=2018-02-26|title=Feature: Shining A Light On Ikegami Tsushinki, The Company That Developed Donkey Kong|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/02/feature_shining_a_light_on_ikegami_tsushinki_the_company_that_developed_donkey_kong|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Nintendo Life|language=en-GB}}</ref>

''Space Fever'' was released in Japan in February 1979.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Akagi |first1=Masumi |title=アーケードTVゲームリスト国内•海外編(1971-2005) |date=October 13, 2006 |publisher=Amusement News Agency |location=Japan |isbn=978-4990251215 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005/page/n58 57] |edition=First |url=https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005 |accessdate=August 16, 2019}}</ref> It was released as a tabletop arcade cabinet with a [[black and white]] [[raster graphics|raster]] monitor; a version featuring single-color graphics was released later in the year.

==Legacy==
A special version of ''Space Fever'' called {{nihongo foot|''SF-Hisplitter''|SFハイスプリッター|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released the same year and features aliens that are double the width of the standard variety, which can either be destroyed completely or split into two smaller aliens depending on where they are shot. This version is in color, and the shelter blocks are visually distinct from the monochrome version. Like with the original Space Fever, SF-Hisplitter was also distributed in America by Far East Video.<ref>{{cite web | title = SF-Hisplitter arcade flyer | url = https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/flyers_video/nintendo/22000401.jpg | accessdate = 2021-08-19}}</ref>

A sequel to ''Space Fever'', titled {{nihongo foot|''Space Fever II'',|スペースフィーバーII|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a minigame in the [[Game Boy Camera]] cartridge. The game also acts as a menu for selecting the other built-in minigames. It deviates from the ''Space Invaders'' formula, featuring instead smaller waves of individual aliens and bosses based on faces of Nintendo staff as well as the "game face" photo taken by the player.
