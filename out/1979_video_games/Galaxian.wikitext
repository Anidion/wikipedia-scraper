{{nihongo foot|'''''Galaxian'''''|ギャラクシアン|Gyarakushian|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1979 [[fixed shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Namco]]. The player assumes control of the Galaxip starfighter in its mission to protect Earth from waves of aliens. Gameplay involves destroying each formation of aliens, who dive down towards the player in an attempt to hit them.

Designed by company engineer Kazunori Sawano, ''Galaxian'' was Namco's answer to ''[[Space Invaders]]'', a similar space shooter released the previous year by rival developer [[Taito]]. ''Space Invaders'' was a sensation in Japan, and Namco wanted a game that could compete against it. Sawano strove to make the game simplistic and easy to understand. He was inspired by the cinematic space combat scenes in ''[[Star Wars]]'', with enemies originally being in the shape of the film's [[TIE Fighters]]. ''Galaxian'' is one of the first video games to feature [[RGB]] color graphics and the first ever to use a tile-based hardware system, which was capable of animated multi-color [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] as well as [[scrolling]], though the latter was limited to the starfield background while the game itself remained a fixed shooter.

''Galaxian'' was Namco's first major arcade video game hit. It was the second highest-grossing arcade video game of 1979 and 1980 in Japan and the second highest-grossing of 1980 in the United States, where it became one of the best-selling arcade games of all time with 50,000 arcade units sold by 1982. The game was celebrated for its gameplay and use of true color graphics. In retrospect, it has gained fame for its historical importance and technological accomplishments. Its success led to several sequels and reimaginings, most notably ''[[Galaga]]'', which surpassed it in popularity. ''Galaxian'' has also been ported to many home systems and is included in numerous [[List of Bandai Namco video game compilations|Namco compilations]].

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2022}}
[[File:Galaxian.png|thumb|left|Aliens diving toward the player's ship (arcade)]]

''Galaxian'' is a space-themed [[fixed shooter]]. The player controls a starship called the "Galaxip", the objective being to clear each round of aliens. The enemies appear in formation towards the top of the screen, with two escort ships, labeled the "Galaxian Flagship" or "Galboss". Enemies will make a divebomb towards the bottom of the screen while shooting projectiles in an attempt to hit the player. The Galaxip can only fire a single shot at a time, and the player must wait for it to either hit an enemy or the top of the screen before being able to fire another, due to limitations of the hardware.

Flagships will make a divebomb with two red escort ships - shooting all three of these will award the player bonus points, with extra points awarded to the destruction of the flagship. Enemy movement will increase as the game progresses alongside the number of shots that the enemies fire. Rounds are indicated by small flags at the bottom of the screen. The game's attract mode featured a slim scenario, reading "WE ARE THE GALAXIANS. MISSION: DESTROY ALIENS".

==Development==
''Galaxian'' was designed by Kazunori Sawano, who had previously worked on many of Namco's electro-mechanical shooting gallery arcade games, notably ''[[Shoot Away]]'' (1977).<ref name="TV Game">{{cite book |author1=Video Game Museum Project |title=Terebi gēmu. |date=June 1988 |publisher=You B You |isbn=978-4946432316 |url=http://shmuplations.com/earlyarcade/ |language=ja}}</ref> Early in the game's development, [[Taito]] had released ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in Japan, which swept the country by storm and helped turn the video game industry into a highly-profitable business. To help capitalize on the game's success, Namco president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] ordered Sawano to make the best "post-Invaders" game they could, which put a vast amount of pressure on the development team.<ref name="TV Game"/> Although development of the game lasted six months, Sawano had made several ideas half a year before production began.<ref name="TV Game"/>

Sawano and his team set out to make a game anybody could play, using a "simple is best" motto during production – this helped trim away large-scale ideas in favor of a game that could loop endlessly and be able to use only two enemy types.<ref name="1985 Interview">{{cite web |title=Galaxian - 1985 Developer Interview |url=http://shmuplations.com/galaga/ |access-date=3 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606111333/http://shmuplations.com/galaga/ |archive-date=6 June 2019 |date=1985}}</ref> Alongside ''Space Invaders'', a large portion of the game was inspired by ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', specifically its large-scale space battles.<ref name="TV Game"/> Sawano had wanted to replicate the feeling of a space battle, specifically with the game's sound effects.<ref name="TV Game"/> Several back-and-forth sound effects were made, many being rejected by Sawano for not matching his vision. The game was Namco's first arcade game to be composed with a synthesizer.<ref name="TV Game"/>

Game balance was an important part of the game, as Sawano did not want to make the game suddenly spike in difficulty with no build-up or warning;<ref name="TV Game"/> the development team made the number of enemies on-screen the same and gradually increased the difficulty as the player progresses, becoming more noticeable in later stages.<ref name="TV Game"/> The enemies themselves were designed to have a personality of their own, programmed to monitor the player's movements and make attacks based on them<ref name="1985 Interview"/> - early in development, Sawano had envisioned the enemies to resemble TIE Fighters from ''Star Wars''.<ref name="TV Game"/> To save up on hardware memory and processing, programmers created a tilemap hardware model, which created a set of 8x8 pixel tiles – this reduced processing and memory requirements up to 64 times, compared to the [[framebuffer]] model used in ''Space Invaders''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Before the Crash: Early Video Game History |author=Mark J.

== Legacy ==
The ''Galaxian'' arcade hardware had a significant influence on the hardware design of [[Nintendo]]'s later arcade and console systems, including the arcade hardware for ''[[Radar Scope]]'' (1980) and ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' (1981) as well as the [[Famicom]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. According to [[Nintendo R&D2]] lead engineer [[Masayuki Uemura]], ''Galaxian'' replaced the more intensive [[bitmap]] rendering system of ''Space Invaders'' with a hardware [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] rendering system that animated sprites over a scrolling background, allowing more detailed graphics, faster gameplay and a scrolling animated starfield background. This provided the basis for Nintendo's ''Radar Scope'' arcade hardware, which improved on ''Galaxian'' with technology such as high-speed [[emitter-coupled logic]] [[integrated circuit]] chips and [[Computer memory|memory]] on a 50&nbsp;MHz [[printed circuit board]]. Following the commercial failure of ''Radar Scope'', the game's arcade hardware was converted for use with ''Donkey Kong'', which became a major arcade hit. Home systems at the time were not powerful enough to handle an accurate port of ''Donkey Kong'', so Nintendo wanted to create a system that allowed a fully accurate conversion of ''Donkey Kong'' to be played in homes, leading to the development of the Famicom.<ref name="Nikkei6"/>

===Sequels===
{{Further|List of Galaxian video games}}

''Galaxian'' spawned a long series of sequels and spin-offs for multiple game platforms, including arcade hardware and home video game systems. The first of these, ''[[Galaga]]'', was released in 1981, usurping the original in popularity as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]], becoming a popular game during the [[golden age of arcade video games]] in North America. It was followed by ''[[Gaplus]]'' in 1984, which added power-up items and juggling-based bonus stages. ''[[Galaga '88]]'' was released in 1987, published in North America by [[Atari Games]], which featured branching level paths, new enemy types and multiple endings.

In 1990, Namco produced a theme-park attraction based on the series, ''[[Galaxian3: Project Dragoon]]''. Originally presented at [[Expo '90]] and moved to Namco's Wonder Eggs theme park two years later, it was a rail shooter where up to 28 players used lightguns to shoot down enemies and projectiles. A smaller version for arcades was released in 1992, followed by a 1996 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] release in Japan and Europe. In 1995, an arcade remake of ''Galaga'' was released for the ''[[Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1]]'' compilation, ''Galaga Arrangement''. This game added two-player co-operative play and boss fights, alongside new enemy and weapon types. It was ported to the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]] in 2002 as part of the compilation disk ''[[Namco Museum]]''.

A Japan-only [[medal game]] spin-off, ''Galaxian Fever'', was released in 2000 as part of Namco's ''Shooting Medal'' series. The following year, [[Hasbro Interactive]] released ''[[Galaga: Destination Earth]]'' for the PlayStation and [[Game Boy Color]], adding side-scrolling and third-person stages to the core gameplay. The 2005 [[PlayStation Portable]] compilation ''[[Namco Museum Battle Collection]]'' includes a remake of ''Galaga'' titled ''Galaga Arrangement'', having no relation to the one featured in ''Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1''. This game was later ported to [[iOS]] devices in 2009, renamed ''[[Galaga Remix]]''. In 2008, [[Namco Bandai Games]] released a downloadable game for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], ''[[Galaga Legions]]'' – this game was instead a twin-stick shooter game with score attack modes and multiple stages. It was followed by a 2011 sequel, ''[[Galaga Legions DX]]'', branded under the now-defunct [[Namco Generations]] label.
