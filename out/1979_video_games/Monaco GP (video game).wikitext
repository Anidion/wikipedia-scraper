{{Nihongo foot|'''''Monaco GP'''''|モナコGP|Monako GP|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} is an [[arcade racing game]] released by [[Sega]] in November 1979 in Japan, and January 1980 worldwide. An upgraded version, '''''Pro Monaco GP''''', was released later in 1980. One of the last [[Sega games]] to use [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] chips instead of a [[microprocessor]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], the game has players race against a clock and pass rival racers while attempting to earn points driving through five areas.

The game was commercially successful in arcades. In Japan, it was among the top three highest-grossing games of 1979 and top five in 1980, while in the United States it was the top-grossing driving game of 1981. It continued to regularly appear on Japanese arcade charts through 1983, and made a record number of appearances on US arcade charts from 1980 through 1987. ''Monaco GP'' was ported to the [[SG-1000]] in 1983. The series also had later releases ''[[Super Monaco GP]]'' and ''[[Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II]]''.

''Monaco GP'' is a racing game played from an overhead perspective,<ref name=":72">{{Cite book |title=Sega Arcade History |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-4-7577-0790-0 |pages=39–40 |language=ja}}</ref> where the main objective is to finish a course before time runs out. Points are awarded as the player races through five areas. As the game progresses, rival cars controlled by the game's [[artificial intelligence]] get faster, the road narrows, and the road surface changes to ice and gravel.<ref name=":110">{{Cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|title=The Sega Arcade Revolution, A History in 62 Games|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2018|isbn=9781476631967|pages=27–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xT1jDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|ref=refHorowitz2018}}</ref> Various hazards in the road include puddles, narrow bridges, and tunnels where the driver's view is limited by the range of the car's headlights on screen. The timer continues counting down until 2000 points are scored; then, the system changes to a limited number of [[Life (video games)|lives]]. At 6000 points and again at 8000, rival cars increase in speed. According to ''Sega Arcade History'', the concept for this timer system came from Sega Enterprises president [[Hayao Nakayama]]. ''Pro Monaco GP'', an upgraded version of the game released later, features a higher difficulty level than the original game.<ref name=":72" />

== Development and release ==
''Monaco GP'' was one of the last arcade games made by Sega to use [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) based discrete [[Integrated circuit|logic circuits]] instead of a [[microprocessor]]-based [[central processing unit]] (CPU). The game is operated by over 100 chips across two circuit boards. Images are stored in small custom [[read-only memory]] (ROM) chips, including [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], cars, and the "[[game over]]" message. Sound effects, such as the cars' engines, a siren, and the sound of wheels slipping on the pavement, are generated by [[operational amplifiers]] and other analog circuitry. The scoring information appears on various LEDs located on the cabinet, including the player's score and the high score table.<ref name=":110" /> ''Pro Monaco GP'' also features a [[Uninterruptible power supply|battery backup]] system to save high scores if the cabinet loses power.<ref name=":72" />

Multiple styles of arcade cabinet exist for the game, including a deluxe cockpit cabinet which was designed in approximation to sitting behind the wheel of a race car with a padded steering wheel and accelerator pedal.<ref name=":110" /> A tabletop housing and a smaller upright cabinet were also created.<ref name=":72" />

Initially displayed at the Japan Amusement Association show in Tokyo in 1979, ''Monaco GP'' received a positive reception at its debut. Sega chairman [[David Rosen (businessman)|David Rosen]] called the game's warm reception at the show evidence of the world's growing acceptance of coin-operated arcade games.<ref name=":1">{{Cite magazine |date=December 8, 1979 |title=Chairman with Hit Game |magazine=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] |page=42}}</ref> ''Monaco GP'' was released in November 1979 in Japan,<ref name=":72" /> and in January 1980 worldwide via [[Gremlin Industries|Sega/Gremlin]].<ref name="Akagi35" /> ''Pro Monaco GP'', an upgraded version with a higher difficulty level, was released in Japan in March 1980,<ref name=":72" /> and worldwide in July of the same year.<ref name="Akagi35" /> The original game was later ported to the [[SG-1000]] and SC-3000, Sega's first video game consoles.<ref name=":2" /> The SG-1000 port was released in 1983 in Japan,<ref name="SegaSoft">{{cite web |title=SG-1000 |url=http://sega.jp/fb/segahard/sg1000/soft.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209183709/http://sega.jp/fb/segahard/sg1000/soft.html |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |access-date=February 12, 2014 |publisher=[[Sega|Sega Corporation]] |language=ja |df=mdy-all}}</ref> and by March 1984 in Europe.<ref name=":2" />

Sega revived the ''Monaco GP'' series with ''[[Super Monaco GP]]'' in 1989,<ref name=":110" /> and ''[[Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II]]'' in 1992.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=October 1992|title=Monthly Hit Chart|magazine=Mega Drive Fan|language=ja|page=67}}</ref> ''Super Monaco GP'' designer [[Hisao Oguchi]] had played ''Monaco GP'' before working for Sega, and when Oguchi decided to design a game based on Formula One, he started with a different name but chose ''Super Monaco GP'' after listening to opinions that the name was a good one. He referenced a parallel between the [[Monaco Grand Prix]] being the top event in racing and Sega being the top company in arcades.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=February 1991 |title=Sega Masterpiece Development Secret Story - Old Days Story: Monaco GP vs. Super Monaco GP |magazine=Beep!
