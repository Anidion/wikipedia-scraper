==Development==
The game was written by [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]], who went on to develop ''[[Pitfall!]]''. Crane developed the game for his mother, who was a lover of slot-machine games.<ref name="Retro Injection interview">{{cite web |last1=Dave |title=Exclusive Interview with Activision Founder David Crane! |url=https://www.retroinjection.com/post/exclusive-interview-with-david-crane |website=Retro Injection |access-date=27 February 2021 |date=17 November 2018 |quote=My  mother was the typical little old lady who liked to play slot machines when in Vegas, so I made Slot Machine for her to play at home.}}</ref><ref name="Retro Gamer UK interview">{{cite news |title=In the chair with...

==Reception==
In a July 1983 review in ''[[Electronic Games]]'' magazine, Joyce Worley and Tracie Forman described the graphics as "workman-like if unspectacular".<ref name="Worley & Forman" />

A December 2000 review of the game in ''Classic Gamer Magazine'' written by Leonard Herman was highly critical of the game, including it in a list of games that he "loved to hate" and criticising the lack of tension in the gameplay and the poor graphics.<ref name="Herman">{{cite news |last1=Herman |first1=Leonard |title=Games We Love To Hate |url=https://archive.org/details/Classic_Gamer_Magazine_Volume_1_Issue_5_2000-09_Classic_Gamer_US/page/n11/mode/2up?q=%22Slot+Machine%22 |access-date=27 February 2021 |work=Classic Gamer Magazine |issue=5 |date=December 2000 |page=13}}</ref>
