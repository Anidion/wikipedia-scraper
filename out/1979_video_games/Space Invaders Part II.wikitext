{{nihongo foot|'''''Space Invaders Part II'''''|スペースインベーダーパートII|Supēsu Inbēdā Pāto Tsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1979 [[fixed shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Taito]]. In North America, it was distributed by [[Midway Games]] as '''''Space Invaders Deluxe'''''. It is the sequel to ''[[Space Invaders]]'' (1978). The player controls a laser base that must destroy formations of descending aliens, while avoiding their projectiles. New features have been added, such as aliens that split into two when shot, an increased [[high score]] limit with the player able to save their name as initials, and short [[cutscenes]] in-between stages. It runs on the Taito 8080 arcade system.

==Gameplay==

''Space Invaders Part II'' is a fixed shooter with mechanics similar to its predecessor. The player controls a laser base that must eliminate all of the aliens that march down from the top of the screen, who plot to take over Earth.<ref name="Manual">{{cite book |title=Space Invaders Virtual Collection instruction manual (translated from Japanese) |date=1 December 1995 |publisher=[[Taito]] |url=https://www.planetvb.com/content/manuals/pdf/sp_usa_trans_im.pdf |accessdate=14 September 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530081642/https://www.planetvb.com/content/manuals/pdf/sp_usa_trans_im.pdf |archivedate=30 May 2019}}</ref> Aliens slowly move towards the edge of the screen and then move downward, increasing in speed as more aliens are killed.<ref name="Manual"/> The player can protect their laser base from incoming projectiles by hiding underneath large shields, which become damaged when inflicted by projectiles fired by either the player or aliens.<ref name="Manual"/> A [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] will occasionally appear at the top of the screen, which can be shot down for bonus points.<ref name="Manual"/>

Alongside the core ''Space Invaders'' gameplay, ''Part II'' introduces several new elements.

==Legacy==
While the gameplay was largely identical to the original ''Space Invaders'', it added several new features. The [[high score]] limit was increased to 99,990 points, compared to the original's more conservative 9,990 limit, while also allowing the player to save their name as initials next to their high score.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Definitive Space Invaders (part 1) |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/894697/the_definitive_space_invaders_part_1.html |website=[[NowGamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |date=January 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714114148/www.nowgamer.com/features/894697/the_definitive_space_invaders_part_1.html |archive-date=2014-07-14 |access-date=1 May 2021}}</ref> It also introduced the use of brief comical intermission scenes between levels, where the last invader who gets shot limps off screen, a precursor to the [[cutscene]] breaks that later appeared in ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sellers |first1=John |chapter=Quarter Pounder Deluxe |title=Arcade Fever The Fan's Guide To The Golden Age Of Video Games |date=21 August 2001 |publisher=[[Running Press]] |isbn=978-0-7624-0937-2 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZH2GXbEpYCUC |quote=Deluxe Space Invaders landed in 1979. Titled Space Invaders Part II in Japan, the game replicated the frenzy of the original but didn't bring much novelty to the arcade. Kudos, however, to Taito for one innovation: The sequel featured funny little intermission scenes between levels (a precursor to the breaks in Pac-Man), in which the last invader you shot would limp off screen.}}</ref>

A [[Game Boy]] version of the game was released in 1990, which featured support for the [[Game Link Cable]] to enable multiplayer. A harder, redemption version of the game, ''Prize Space Invaders'', was released the same year, awarding money based on how well the player did.<ref name="Retro Gamer">{{Cite journal|date=September 2007| title= The Definitive Space Invaders| journal= [[Retro Gamer]]| publisher= [[Imagine Publishing]]|issue= 41| pages=  24–33}}</ref><ref name="NCE"/> ''Part II'' is included in the compilations ''[[Space Invaders Virtual Collection]]'' (1995),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parish |first1=Jeremy |title=Space Invaders: Virtual Collection retrospective: The Andromeda eyestrain |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY8-ukKj8m4 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=13 September 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905184531/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY8-ukKj8m4&gl=US&hl=en&has_verified=1&bpctr=9999999999 |archivedate=5 September 2019 |date=12 June 2019}}</ref> ''Space Invaders Anniversary'' (2004),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Calvert |first1=Justin |title=Empire signs Space Invaders titles |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/empire-signs-space-invaders-titles/1100-6086826/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=25 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025011542/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/empire-signs-space-invaders-titles/1100-6086826/ |archivedate=25 October 2019 |date=22 January 2004}}</ref> ''[[Taito Memories|Taito Memories Gekan]]'' (2005), ''[[Taito Legends]]'' (2005),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gerstmann |first1=Jeff |title=Taito Legends Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/taito-legends-review/1900-6136936/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=25 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511225453/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/taito-legends-review/1900-6136936/ |archivedate=11 May 2019 |date=31 October 2005}}</ref> ''[[Taito Legends Power-Up]]'' (2007),  and ''Space Invaders Pocket'' (2007).
