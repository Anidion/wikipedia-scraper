'''Haunt''' was a straightforward but engagingly irreverent [[text-based]] mainframe computer [[game]]. It was created in [[OPS5|OPS4]] language in 1979 by [[John E. Laird]].<ref>[http://www.lysator.liu.se/adventure/Mainframe_adventures.html Mainframe Adventures]</ref>

In Haunt, the player explores a [[haunted house]] and encounters clues (flight speed of an African swallow), wacky creatures (rampaging moose), and random elements (the bus) as s/he tries to find treasure and escape the house alive.

The game ran on [[DEC-10]] & [[DEC-20]] mainframes running [[TOPS-10]] or [[TOPS-20]]. According to the author, copies exist somewhere in Carnegie Mellon University's archive; although Laird considered rewriting it in an updated language, that did not happen.<ref>http://lysator.liu.se</ref>  On his personal website, Laird wrote " I'm afraid that Haunt is really dead."<ref>[https://laird.engin.umich.edu/haunt/ John Laird's Computer Games Research: Haunt]</ref>

In 1998 the [[source code]] of the partly ported version was given to the Interactive Fiction Archive for publication.<ref>[http://adventure.if-legends.org/Mainframe_adventures.html#HAUNT Haunt] on the Interactive Fiction Archive (1998)</ref><ref>[http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/haunt.ops5 haunt.ops5] source code on Interactive Fiction Archive</ref>

Laird is now a professor at [[University of Michigan]].<ref>[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/laird/ University of Michigan Directory, retrieved October 2008]</ref>  As he describes: "It violated most, if not all, of the design guidelines for good interactive fiction in that you could get killed much too easily, the puzzles were way too obscure (many based on Saturday morning cartoons from my youth), but it had a certain charm."<ref>[https://laird.engin.umich.edu/haunt/ John Laird's Computer Games Research: Haunt]</ref>

==TOPS-20 Emulation and Haunt==
