==Reception==
Carrington Dixon reviewed ''Microsoft Adventure'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 49.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last= Dixon |first= Carrington |date=March 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=49|pages=34}}</ref> Dixon commented that "No game that exists on several different computers can fully demonstrate the potential of any one computer. Even so, your [money] buys many hours of cave exploring and treasure snatching. There is only one 'set-up' but that one is rich and complex enough to keep anyone busy for many games. I suspect that many people will come back to the one after some flashier games have been permanently set aside."<ref name="SG"/> ''[[PC Magazine]]'' also reviewed the game positively, writing, "This hoary old classic should be included in any player's collection of games for the IBM PC."<ref name="pcmagrev">{{cite journal |title=Adventure (Microsoft) |journal=[[PC Magazine]] |date=December 1982 |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=179â€“180}}</ref>
