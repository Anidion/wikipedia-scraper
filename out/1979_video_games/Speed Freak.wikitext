'''Speed Freak''' is a monochrome vector arcade game created by Vectorbeam in 1979. Along with [[Atari, Inc.]]'s ''[[Night Driver (arcade game)|Night Driver]]'' and [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]]'s ''[[Datsun 280 ZZZAP]]''–both from 1976–it is one of the earliest first-person driving games and the first such game known to use vector graphics.<ref>{{harv|Yu|2002}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

The game is a behind-the-wheel driving simulation where the driver speeds down a winding computer generated road past other cars, hitchhikers, trees, cows and cacti. Occasionally a plane will fly overhead towards the screen. One must avoid crashing into these objects and complete the race in the allotted time.<ref>{{cite book|title=Speed Freak Operating Manual|year=1979|chapter=1|page=2}}</ref> The player can crash as many times as he wants before the time runs out and players were treated to two different crash animations. The first was a simple cracked windshield effect, the second was a crash where the car explodes into car parts that fly through the air.<ref>{{cite book|title=Speed Freak Operating Manual|year=1979|chapter=2|page=3}}</ref>
