{{nihongo foot|'''''Bomb Bee'''''|ボムビー|Bomu Bī|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a Japanese [[arcade game]] that was released by [[Namco]] in 1979. It is the sequel to ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'', which was released in the previous year.

==Gameplay==

The maximum number of players is two, and the two players have to alternate. The control is a rotary analog stick. The main object of the game is to move two paddles that ricochet a ball which flies around and needs to hit the colored bricks above it. When the bricks are cleared out of the side sections, it will turn that same side's pop-bumper into 100 points instead of 10. It is a bonus multiplier to get the ball to light up the word "NAMCO".<ref name=bomb>{{cite web|title=Bomb Bee|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179|publisher=The International Arcade Museum|accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>

''Bomb Bee'' was not a success when it was released. According to Matt Barton, the author of the book ''Vintage Games 2.0'', the game did not sell well and likely sold the same amount of machines as ''Gee Bee'', a game that didn't meet sales expectations either.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Matt |title=Vintage Games 2.0 |date=8 May 2019 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9781000000924 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fU-fDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22bomb+bee%22+namco&pg=PA55 |accessdate=9 July 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200709161030/https://www.google.com/books/edition/Vintage_Games_2_0/fU-fDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22bomb+bee%22+namco&pg=PA55&printsec=frontcover |archivedate=9 July 2020}}</ref> The success of Namco's later release ''[[Galaxian]]'', a revolutionary shooting game, is believed to have contributed to its failure.<ref name="Nico"/> When ''Galaxian'' proved successful, Namco offered to bundle ''Bomb Bee'' machines with ''Galaxian'' to arcade owners in order to clear inventory.<ref name="Nico">{{cite web |title=『ワニワニパニック』開発者からグループ会長にまで上り詰めた男が語る、ナムコ激動の40年。創業者・中村雅哉との思い出、バンダイ経営統合の舞台裏【バンダイナムコ前会長・石川祝男インタビュー：ゲームの企画書】 |url=https://news.nicovideo.jp/watch/nw3876772 |website=Nico Nico News |publisher=[[Niconico]] |accessdate=9 July 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405173636/https://news.nicovideo.jp/watch/nw3876772 |archivedate=5 April 2019 |language=ja |date=14 September 2018}}</ref>

Retrospectively in 1998, Earl Green of ''[[AllGame]]'' said that outside a few minor differences, ''Bomb Bee'' was largely the same as its predecessor. However, he noted that the game's usage of a full-color display, and being among the earliest creations by [[Toru Iwatani]], made the game of historical value.<ref name="Allgame"/> In his blog ''Before Mario'', Erik Voskuel says that ''Bomb Bee'' marks the first collaboration between Namco and [[Nintendo]], two developers that would work together on many more titles, making it a historically-significant game. Voskuel also says that ''Bomb Bee'' is notable for being the first appearance of a third-party title on a Nintendo console, and being among Iwatani's earliest creations before ''[[Pac-Man]]''.<ref name="Before Mario">{{cite web |last1=Voskuel |first1=Erik |title=Nintendo / Namco Bomb Bee-N (ボムビーN, 1979) |url=http://blog.beforemario.com/2012/09/nintendo-bomb-bee-n-n-1979.html |website=Before Mario |accessdate=9 July 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217130716/http://blog.beforemario.com/2012/09/nintendo-bomb-bee-n-n-1979.html |archivedate=17 December 2014 |date=30 September 2012}}</ref>
