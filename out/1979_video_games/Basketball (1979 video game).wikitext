==Gameplay==

''Basketball'' supports one and two player modes and uses a trackball to control each player's movement. At the start of each game, the song "[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]" is played. Players must first gain possession of the ball and move towards their opponent's goal. When in position for a shot, the pushbutton is held until the player's arm is at a suitable height and the button is released. Shots can be blocked by an opponent, and, when dribbling, an opponent can steal the ball. The winner is the player with the highest score when the clock runs out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=105&image=2 |title=Atari Basketball Flyer |publisher=Atari Inc. |date=1979 |website=The Arcade Flyer Archive |access-date=11 June 2016}}</ref>
