==Gameplay==

[[File:Human Cannonball Atari 2600.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot]]

The player must fire a cannon at the correct angle and speed to fire a [[human cannonball]] (a man shot from a cannon) into a [[water tower]]. each time the player records a "hit" they receive one point, whilst the computer receives a point each time the player misses, with the winning side being the first to get seven points. Eight different modes of play are available, with the differences between play-modes deciding whether the player can vary the distance from the cannon to the tower. The player may also vary the size of the water tower to make it easier to hit.<ref name="The A-Z of Atari 2600 Games" />

The game may be played in single-player mode, or in a two-player mode where each player takes turns. <ref name="Classic Home Video Games" />
