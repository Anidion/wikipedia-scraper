'''''Samurai''''' is the 45th official [[video game]] for the [[Philips]] [[Videopac]]. in North America, the same game as released as '''''Dynasty!''''' for the [[Magnavox Odyssey²]] console.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videopac.com/mago2.html |title=Videopac.com : Magnavox Odyssey2 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711190104/http://www.videopac.com/mago2.html |archivedate=2015-07-11 }}</ref>

The game is identical to the game [[Reversi]]. It also contains two-player mode, gameplay against the computer, as well as a digital timing handicap which allows newcomers to have a better chance in beating grandmaster players in the game. Similar to other Videopac games, the game did not compare favorably to those for Atari's consoles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}
