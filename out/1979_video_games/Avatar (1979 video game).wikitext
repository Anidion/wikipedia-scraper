Avatar (1979 video game)
{{more citations needed|date=February 2013}}
'''''Avatar''''' is an early graphics-based multi-user highly interactive [[role-playing video game]], created on the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]' [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO system]] in the late 1970s. It has graphics for navigating through a [[dungeon]] and chat-style text for player status and communication with others. It can currently be played [[online]] via Cyber1 or a simulation called Javatar. What makes ''Avatar'' popular is the high level of interactivity with other players and the sense of community that develops. Development on ''Avatar'' began on the University of Illinois PLATO system around 1976 by [[Bruce Maggs]] and Andrew Shapira, who were junior high school students at the time. They were soon joined by David Sides, who was a student at the University of Illinois. The first version was released in 1979.<ref name="orangeglow" />

== History ==
''Avatar'' was a successor to several innovative and highly successful role-playing games on the PLATO system, most notably ''Oubliette'', written by Jim Schwaiger and published on the PLATO system in 1977.<ref name="orangeglow">{{cite book|last1=Dear|first1=Brian|title=The Friendly Orange Glow|date=2017|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=9781101871553|pages=298–305|edition=First|url=http://friendlyorangeglow.com/|accessdate=31 December 2017|ref=orangeglow}}</ref> It was so difficult that one could not play it alone; in order for players to survive, they had to run in groups. Following ''Oubliette'', also on PLATO, was a game called ''[[Moria (1975 video game)|Moria]]'' written in 1977, copyright 1978.<ref name="orangeglow" /><ref name="oubliette">{{cite book | last = Bartle | first = Richard | author-link = Richard Bartle | title = [[Designing Virtual Worlds]] | publisher = New Riders | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-13-101816-7 | pages = 741 | quote = Jim Schwaiger's 1977 game ''Oubliette'' (inspired by ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and Chuck Miller's earlier multiplayer game, ''Mines of Moria'') had a first-person point of view and used line graphics to render the scene ahead. [...] In late 1979, the first ever fully functional graphical virtual world was released: ''Avatar''. Written by a group of students to out-do ''Oubliette'', it was to become the most successful PLATO game ever--it accounted for 6% of all the hours spent on the system between September 1978 and May 1985.}}</ref>

Classic as well as modified versions of ''Avatar 84'' are operating on Cyber1. When the NovaNET system existed, it hosted original versions of both ''Avatar 95'' and ''Avatar 90''. It was also possible to play versions of ''Avatar 84'' and ''Man 60 Avatar'' on Novanet. These last two games operated with the old game data on the ''Avatar 95'' engine, which was not quite the same as playing through the original engine. The NovaNET system was shut down in November 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.platohistory.org/blog/2015/08/august-31-2015-the-end-of-the-road-for-novanet.html|title=PLATO History: August 31, 2015: The End of the Road for NovaNET|website=www.platohistory.org|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
''Avatar'' is inherently a MMO multi-player game.<ref>Richard A. Bartle · MMOs from the Inside Out: The History, Design, Fun, and Art ... 2015- 50b: "PLATO was a more integrated system, running on Control Data Corporation machines. It was way ahead of its time... It also saw several multiplayer games, the most celebrated of which, ''Avatar'', would today be regarded as an MMO".</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/17/the-game-archaeologist-the-plato-mmos-part-2/|title=The Game Archaeologist: The PLATO MMOs, part 2|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-11-11|language=en-US}}</ref>
