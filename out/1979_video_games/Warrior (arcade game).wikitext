'''''Warrior''''' is a [[1979 in video gaming|1979]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[fighting game]]. It is considered one of the first [[fighting game]]s,<ref name = edge>"The Making of... Warrior". (December 2006) ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] Magazine'' '''169''', pp. 101-103</ref> excepting several boxing games such as ''[[Heavyweight Champ (1976 arcade game)|Heavyweight Champ]]'', released in [[1976 in video gaming|1976]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8099 |title=The Killer List of Video Games - Heavyweight Champ (1976) |accessdate=2007-04-10 }}</ref> and Atari's unreleased ''Boxer'' (which was cloned as 1980's ''[[Boxing (1980 video game)|Boxing]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]]).

Developed by [[Tim Skelly]] while working at [[Cinematronics]], it was released under the [[Vectorbeam]] company name shortly before Cinematronics closed Vectorbeam, which they had purchased in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caesar.logiqx.com/php/history.php?id=warrior |title=Warrior |accessdate=2006-10-28 }}</ref> The game featured two [[duel]]ing knights rendered in [[monochrome]] [[vector graphics]] and based on crude [[motion capture]] techniques.  Due to the limitations of the hardware, the [[CPU|processor]] could not render the characters and gaming environment at the same time, so backgrounds were printed and the characters projected on top of them.<ref name = edge />

==Controls==
Originally Skelly planned for a two-player system with each player using two [[joystick]]s, one to control the movement of the player and the other controlling the player's weapon.  However, financial constraints restricted the cabinet to one stick for each player and a [[Button (control)|button]] to switch between character and weapon modes. The sticks were produced in house and installed in [[Arcade cabinet|cabinet]]s in a way that players found unresponsive and difficult to use.<ref name = edge />

==Legacy==
The cabinets and hardware were produced on a low budget and proved to be very unreliable when compared to contemporary machines.  As a result, very few remain in working order, with only one known restored machine in the [[United Kingdom]]<ref name = edge /> Warrior is emulated by [[MAME]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caesar.logiqx.com/php/emulator_game.php?id=mame&game=warrior |title=Warrior |accessdate=2006-10-28 }}</ref>
