'''''Strange Odyssey ''''' is a [[text adventure]] written by [[Scott Adams (game designer)|Scott Adams]] and Neil Broome.

== Description ==

Published by [[Adventure International]], this text-based adventure game was one of many from Scott Adams.

Gameplay involved moving from location to location, picking up any objects found there, and using them somewhere else to unlock puzzles. Commands took the form of [[verb]] and [[noun]], e.g. "Take Shovel". Movement from location to location was limited to North, South, East, West, Up, and Down.

The game begins with the player stranded on a tiny [[asteroid]] in a damaged spaceship.  The player must use an alien [[teleportation]] device to travel to distant worlds, collect treasure, and find the materials to repair the spacecraft.

==Reception==
''Kilobaud Microcomputing'' stated that ''Strange Odyssey'' was inferior in quality to ''[[Adventureland (computer game)|Adventureland]]'' despite being released later, stating that the older game had "many more treasures and situations to figure out" and criticizing ''Strange Odyssey''{{'}}s lack of help for novice players.<ref name="colsher198009">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/kilobaudmagazine-1980-09/Kilobaud_Microcomputing_1980_September#page/n103/mode/2up | title=Role-Playing Games Reviewed | work=Kilobaud | date=September 1980 | accessdate=23 June 2014 | author=Colsher, William L. | pages=106–108}}</ref> The game was reviewed in issue #42 of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'' magazine. The reviewer, Mark Herro, stated that "My present situation in this game is opposite that of ''[[Pirate Adventure]]''. I’ve found treasures but I don’t know where to take them! ... The game starts in the control room of a disabled spaceship. It took me a good half hour just to find my way out of the spaceship! To compound problems, a space suit must be worn when outside the spaceship. When the air is gone, that’s it, my friend."<ref name="Dragon42">{{cite journal
