Published by [[Adventure International]] and the second game of the series, after ''[[Adventureland (video game)|Adventureland]]'', this text-based adventure game was one of many adventure games created by Scott Adams,<ref name="Dragon42">{{cite journal

|pages=42–43}}</ref> in this case based on his wife Alexis's ideas.{{r|adams198012}} The setting was inspired by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s 1883 novel ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and involved a quest to retrieve [[Long John Silver]]'s lost treasures.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lysator.liu.se/adventure/Adventure_International/Classic.html | title=Scott Adams Classic Adventures }}</ref>

Gameplay involved moving from location to location, picking up any objects found there, and using them somewhere else to unlock puzzles. Commands took the form of [[verb]] and [[noun]], e.g. "Climb Tree".

The player starts the game in a London flat, and progresses via a bit of [[Magic (game terminology)|magic]] to Pirates Island. Here, the player has to build a ship to reach Treasure Island and there find two pieces of [[treasure]]. The player also has to contend with an unpredictable pirate ally; it was the first text adventure game of the Adams series in which the player shared the adventure with a second character.

The magic phrase to reach the island in this game, 'Say Yoho', was the name of a long-running column in ''[[SoftSide]]'' magazine by Scott Adams.

==Reception==
''Pirate Adventure'' was reviewed in issue #42 of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'' magazine. The reviewer, Mark Herro, commented on the difficulty of the game: "Supposedly one of the "easier" programs of the series, I'm embarrassed to say that I have yet to find a treasure in ''Pirate Adventure''... This Program has been sending me in circles for weeks."<ref name="Dragon42"/>

Bruce Campbell reviewed ''Pirate's Cove'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 36.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Campbell |first=Bruce |date=February 1981 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=36|pages=27–28}}</ref> Campbell commented that "''Pirate's Cove'' is a good first adventure (some of the others are harder), but also entertaining for the experienced adventurer."<ref name="SG"/>
