'''''FS1 Flight Simulator''''' is a 1979 [[video game]] published by [[Sublogic]] for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]]. A [[TRS-80]] version followed in 1980. FS1 is the first in a line of simulations from Sublogic which, beginning in 1982, were also sold by Microsoft as ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]''.

Sublogic later released updated versions for both the Apple II and TRS-80 on [[Floppy disk#5.C2.BC-inch floppy disk|5 {{fraction|1|4}}&nbsp;inch diskettes]]. The updates include enhanced terrain, help menus, and a bomb sight.

''FS1 Flight Simulator'' is a flight simulator in which the player pilots a somewhat modernized [[Sopwith Camel]].<ref name="SG"/>

==Development==
Computer-graphics specialist [[Bruce Artwick]] and pilot and marketing student [[Stu Moment]] were roommates at the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]. Released for the Apple II computer as ''A2-FS1 Flight Simulator with British Ace - 3D Aerial Battle'',<ref>{{cite web |url= https://fs1.applearchives.com/manuals/sublogic_a2fs1_manual.pdf |title= sublogic_a2fs1_manual |last= |first= |date= |website= fs1.applearchives.com |publisher= |access-date= 2023-12-01 |quote=}}</ref> it was their first product after forming Sublogic,<ref name="hockman198704">{{cite magazine | title=Bruce Artwick's Flight Simulator / You've Come A Long Way, Baby! / The History of an Epic Program | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=36 | date=April 1987 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1987&pub=2&id=36 | accessdate=23 April 2016 | last=Hockman | first=Daniel | pages=32–34}}</ref> has black and white wireframe graphics, with very limited scenery consisting of 36 tiles (in a 6 by 6 pattern, which roughly equals a few hundred square kilometers), and provides a very basic simulation of one aircraft.

Sublogic advertised that the $25 FS1 "is a visual flight simulator that gives you realistically stable aircraft control", with a graphics engine "capable of drawing 150 lines per second".<ref name="sublogic198001">{{Cite magazine |date=January 1980 |title=New for the Apple II & TRS-80... the subLOGIC FS1 Flight Simulator! |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1980-01#page/n95/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |type=advertisement |page=94}}</ref>

==Ports==
The simulator was later ported to the [[TRS-80]] Model I under the name ''T80-FS1'',<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.mobygames.com/game/18186/flight-simulator/screenshots/trs-80/389479/ |title= Flight Simulator |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= mobygames |publisher= |access-date= 2023-12-01 |quote=}}</ref> which has only [[TRS-80#Video and audio|rudimentary graphics]] capability. Because of the TRS-80's limited memory and display, the instrument panel was dropped and the resolution of the cockpit window display reduced.

==Reception==
J. Mishcon reviewed ''FS1 Flight Simulator'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 31. Mishcon commented that "all things considered, this is single most impressive computer game I have seen. It creates a whole new standard. I most strongly urge you to buy it and see for yourself".<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Mishcon|first=J. |date=September 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=31|pages=28}}</ref>

Bob Proctor reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and said that "although there are other flight simulators, the Sublogic program remains unique for the built-in dogfight game. While raving about the simulation, reviewers have called the game 'difficult', 'challenging', and 'next to impossible'".<ref name="CGW3">{{cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |title=You Too Can Be an Ace! |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=March–April 1982 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=32–33}}</ref>
