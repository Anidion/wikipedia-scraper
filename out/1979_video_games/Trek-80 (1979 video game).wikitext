'''''Trek-80''''' is a [[computer game]] developed by [[Judges Guild]] in 1979 for the [[TRS-80]].

==Plot==
''Trek-80'' is a game in which the player must destroy all the Klingon ships within a time limit and cannot lose more than five supply tugs. The player uses the warp drive to move the ship for galactic travel, and impulse drive for moving through the inner quadrant. The Enterprise and Klingon vessels are armed with phasers and photon torpedoes, but the supply tugs only have phasers. The Enterprise is also able to use a ram for an attack.<ref name="Dragon36"/>

==Gameplay==

The graphic layout is the usual galactic grid overlaid by an 8 Ã— 8 quadrant grid found in [[Star Trek (text game)|Trek]] games. The Enterprise is depicted by an "E", and Klingons by a "K", and the tugs by the up arrow. Additional information displayed on-screen includes: stardate, ship's condition, quadrant, ship's energy, bases, torpedoes, and number of tugs lost.<ref name="Dragon36"/>

==Development==
As part of their plan to compete with [[TSR (company)|TSR]], Judges Guild increased production on their print products, and they also started to diversify by moving into computer game production, although ''Trek-80'' (1979) was their only computer game.<ref name="designers70s">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons: The '70s|publisher=[[Evil Hat Productions]]|year=2014| isbn=978-1-61317-075-5}}</ref>{{rp|198}}

''Trek-80'' was a basic language, 16K program written by Bruce Berry, and was the first computer game produced by a science-fiction/fantasy wargaming company. Barry took many ideas from the numerous Trek programs already on the market, and added a few new and different twists.<ref name="Dragon36"/>

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1980 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'' #36 by Michael Dodge. Dodge concluded the review with, "''Trek-80'' is a well written program and a good ''Star Trek'' game. The program's graphics are well laid out and easy to read, the mechanics are adequate, and the introductions of ramming and tugs are excellent features".<ref name="Dragon36">{{cite journal
