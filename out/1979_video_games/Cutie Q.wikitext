{{nihongo foot|'''''Cutie Q'''''|キューティ{{ruby|Q|キュー}}|Kyūti Kyū|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1979 block breaker/video pinball hybrid [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Namco]] in Japan. The player controls a set of paddles with a rotary knob, the objective being to score as many points possible by deflecting a ball against blocks, ghosts, spinners and other objects on the playfield. It was designed by Shigeru Yokoyama, with [[Sprite (computer graphics)|spritework]] done by [[Toru Iwatani]]. It is the third and final game in the ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'' trilogy.

''Cutie Q'' is described as Namco's first "character game", thanks to its use of colorful and cute character designs, a choice that was a major influence on Iwatani's next project, ''[[Pac-Man]]''. The title was derived from the band [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s 1968 cover of the song [[Susie Q (song)|Susie Q]], which Iwatani was a fan of. To lower manufacturing costs, it was only sold as a conversion kit for older ''Gee Bee'' and ''Bomb Bee'' arcade units.

The game was ported to the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1996 as part of the Japanese release of ''[[Namco Museum|Namco Museum Vol. 2]]'', with ''Bomb Bee'' included as an unlockable extra — international versions replaced them both with ''[[Super Pac-Man]]''. The game was later included in 2007's ''[[Namco Museum Remix]]'' for the [[Wii]], and later in its 2010 update ''Namco Museum Megamix''. A Japanese mobile phone port was released for Yahoo! Keitai services in 2008, where it was renamed ''QTQ''. Ports for both the Sharp X1 and PC-9801 were developed but later cancelled.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Cutieq.gif|200px|left|thumb|Arcade screenshot]]
''Cutie Q'' is a block breaker video game intermixed with elements found in pinball tables. The player controls a set of paddles using a rotary dial, the objective is to score as many points possible by deflecting a ball against objects on the playfield<ref name="All About Namco"/> - these include colorful "Rainbow Block" formations, pink ghosts known as "Minimon",<ref name="All About Namco"/><ref name="NMV2 manual"/> spinners that slow down the ball and small yellow creatures known as "Walkmen" that appear when an entire formation of blocks is destroyed.<ref name="All About Namco"/><ref name="NMV2 manual"/>

The middle of the screen has a set of sad-faced rollover symbols, and touching them with the ball will instead make them turn happy<ref name="NMV2 manual">{{cite book |title=Namco Museum Vol. 2 instruction booklet |date=9 February 1996 |publisher=[[Namco]] |pages=12–13}}</ref> — lighting all of them up increases the score multiplier.<ref name="All About Namco"/> An extra ball is awarded by touching each of the lettered symbols found on both sides of the screen, or by having the ball collide with the green drainage blocks found at the bottom.<ref name="NMV2 manual"/><ref name="All About Namco"/> Having the ball touch the bottom paddle will replace any cleared-out brick formations and increase the number of Minimon on the screen.<ref name="All About Namco"/>

==Development and release==
''Cutie Q'' was developed and released by [[Namco]] in November 1979,<ref name="All About Namco">{{cite book |author1=Microcomputer BASIC Editorial Department |title=All About Namco |date=December 1986 |publisher=Dempa Shimbun |isbn=978-4885541070 |language=Japanese}}</ref> following the release of ''[[Galaxian]]''.<ref name="Yokoyama QTQ"/> The game was designed by Shigeru Yokoyama, known for his work on ''[[Galaga]]'', while [[Toru Iwatani]] designed a number of the sprites.<ref name="Yokoyama QTQ">{{cite web |title=Galaga - 30th Anniversary Developer Interview |url=http://shmuplations.com/galaga/ |publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]] |access-date=3 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606111333/http://shmuplations.com/galaga/ |archive-date=6 June 2019 |date=2011}}</ref> It is the third game in the ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'' trilogy, and much like its predecessors was the result of a compromise with Namco, who was disinterested in creating pinball machines.

In 1987, a port of ''Cutie Q'' and its predecessor ''Bomb Bee'' was being developed for the Sharp X1 by Dempa, a developer that had worked with Namco to bring many of the company's arcade titles to home computers in Japan.<ref name="Szczepaniak">{{cite book |last1=Szczepaniak |first1=John |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |date=11 August 2014 |isbn=978-0992926007 |pages=363 |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |edition=First |url=https://archive.org/details/TheUntoldHistoryOfJapaneseGameDevelopersVol.2JohnSzczepaniak/page/n361?q=cutie+q |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> Programming was done by Mikito Ishikawa, who was fascinated with the arcade version's source code.<ref name="Szczepaniak"/> The game was cancelled due to the impending rise of more powerful consoles, notably the Sega Mega Drive, with Dempa believing Ishikawa was proposing the port as a sort of joke.<ref name="Szczepaniak"/> A second port was in development by Ishikawa for the PC-9801 in the mid-1990s; a deal with Namco was nearly finished, but was cancelled again due to the company instead porting it to the PlayStation for ''Namco Museum Vol. 2''.<ref name="Szczepaniak"/>

==Reception and legacy==
In their coverage of ''Namco Museum Vol. 2'', ''[[Computer & Video Games]]'' called the game "brilliantly addictive" for combining the gameplay of ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'' and pinball tables, as well as for the inclusion of an "authentic" paddle controller to play it.<ref name="C&VG">{{cite news |title=Namco Museum 2 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_175_1996-06_EMAP_Images_GB/page/n47 |access-date=3 August 2019 |agency=[[Computer & Video Games]] |issue=175 |date=June 1996}}</ref> In a retrospective, Earl Green of [[Allgame]] noted the game's importance to the creation of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' with its colorful character designs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Earl |title=Cutie-Q - Review |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9851&tab=review |website=[[Allgame]] |access-date=3 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116020346/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9851&tab=review |archive-date=16 November 2014}}</ref> Kristan Reed of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' was more negative, calling the game "rubbish" in his review of ''[[Namco Museum Remix]]'', commenting that while the game was interesting for its historical value, said that players would only play it for a few minutes before becoming bored.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Reed |first1=Kristan |title=Namco Museum Remix |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/namco-museum-remix-review?page=2 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |access-date=3 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219111010/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/namco-museum-remix-review?page=2 |archive-date=19 February 2019 |page=2 |date=18 December 2008}}</ref>

In 1987, nearly a decade after the release of ''Cutie Q'', Namco released a similar block breaker game, ''[[Quester]]'', in an effort to compete against [[Taito]]'s ''[[Arkanoid]]'' — Iwatani was assigned as the project's producer.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Narusawa |first1=Daisuke |title=The Namco Book |date=1 March 1991 |publisher=JICC Publishing Bureau |isbn=978-4-7966-0102-3}}</ref> Although not directly related to the ''Gee Bee'' trilogy, the game's 26th stage is designed after a Rainbow Block ''Cutie Q''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yamakawa |first1=Mari |title=クエスター |date=November 1987 |publisher=[[Gamest]] |page=88}}</ref> This game was ported to the Japanese [[Wii Virtual Console]] in 2009, renamed to ''Namco Quester''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Saeki |first1=Kenji |title=バンダイナムコ、バーチャルコンソール アーケードに 「爆突機銃艇」、「メルヘンメイズ」など追加20本のタイトルを配信 |url=https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/309696.html |website=GAME Watch |publisher=Impress Watch  |language=Japanese |access-date=4 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411095416/https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/309696.html |archive-date=11 April 2019 |date=20 August 2009}}</ref>
