'''''Head On''''' is an [[arcade video game]] developed by [[Gremlin Industries|Sega/Gremlin]] and released by [[Sega]] in 1979. It's the first [[maze game]] where the goal is to run over dots.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Ken |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1041854216 |title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games |date=2018 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-3196-7 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |page=26 |oclc=1041854216}}</ref> Designed by Lane Hauck at Sega/Gremlin in the United States, it was the fourth highest-grossing arcade game of 1979 in both Japan and the US.

Sega released a sequel, '''''Head On Part II''''', later the same year. The original inspired a number of clones, as well as [[Namco]]'s ''[[Rally-X]]'' (1980).

==Gameplay==
[[image:Sega_Head_On.png|thumb|Arcade screenshot]]
Two cars continuously drive forward through rectangular channels in a simple maze. At the four cardinal directions are gaps where a car can change lanes. The player goal is to collect all dots in the maze while avoiding collisions with the computer-controlled car that is travelling in the opposite direction.

==Development==
The game was developed by [[Gremlin Industries|Sega/Gremlin]] in the United States, designed by Lane Hauck. He brainstormed the concept in 1978, roughly around the time that [[Sega]] purchased [[Gremlin Industries]]. After the acquisition, veteran Sega engineer Shikanosuke Ochi had a look at a prototype of ''Head On'' and suggested a change. Originally, the rounds in ''Head On'' were dictated by a timer as most games of the 1970s were, but [[Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'' introduced the concept of [[Life (video games)|lives]]. Ochi suggested to Hauck that he should get rid of the timer and replace it with a lives system, which Hauck implemented and later said was "key to making the game big".<ref name="SDR">{{cite news|url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1982/jul/15/cover-exactly-zaxxon/|title=San Diego's Gremlin: how video games work|work=[[San Diego Reader]]|date=1982-07-15|accessdate=2020-10-25}}</ref>

The game has two different orientations for horizontal and vertical monitors. In Japan, the game was released with a vertical orientation to suit the cocktail table [[Arcade cabinet|arcade cabinets]] popular in Japan. In the US, the game was displayed horizontally inside of a standard upright cabinet.

==Reception==
''Head On'' was a commercial success in arcades. In Japan, it became Gremlin's most successful export and a highly influential game in the period after the ''[[Space Invaders]]'' boom.<ref name="SDR"/> It was Japan's fourth highest-grossing [[1979 in video games|arcade game of 1979]], below ''Space Invaders'', ''[[Galaxian]]'' and Sega's ''[[Monaco GP (video game)|Monaco GP]]''.<ref name="GM136">{{cite magazine|title=ベストスリー 本紙調査|trans-title=Best 3 Paper Survey |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=136|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=February 1980|page=2|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19800201p.pdf#page=2}}</ref> ''Head On'' was also the fourth highest-earning arcade video game of 1979 in the United States, below ''Space Invaders'', ''[[Football (1978 video game)|Football]]'' and ''[[Sprint 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Video Games |magazine=RePlay |date=November 1979}}</ref>

==Legacy==
''Head On''<nowiki/>'s relation to ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980) as a game about collecting dots inside of a maze-like structure has been noted by commentators and historians.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Alexander |title=They create worlds: the story of the people and companies that shaped the video game industry |date=2020 |publisher=CRC Press, Taylor & Francis group |isbn=978-1-138-38990-8 |location=Boca Raton, [Florida] London New York, [New York]}}</ref> Though there has not been direct confirmation on its influence, the importance of ''Head On'' in Japan around the time of ''Pac-Man''<nowiki/>'s development suggests a correlation between the two. Several evolutions on the ''Head On'' formula released in 1979 including ''[[Space Chaser]]'' (1979) and ''Car Hunt'' (1979) bare further resemblance to ''Pac-Man''.

Ports of ''Head On'' for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[VIC-20]] were released in 1982. In Japan, the game was released for the [[PC-8801]] and [[Sharp MZ]] computers.<ref name="Famitsu">{{cite book |chapter=1979 |title=Sega Arcade History |date=2002 |series=[[Famitsu DC]] |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |pages=37-39 (38) |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/segaarcadehistoryfamitsudc/page/n39 |lang=ja}}</ref>  ''Head On'' later appeared in the [[Sega Saturn]] collection ''Sega Memorial Selection Vol.1'' and in the [[PlayStation 2]] collection ''Sega Ages Vol. 23''. 

===Sequels===
A sequel was released the same year as the original: ''Head On 2'' (1979), also known as ''Head On Part II''.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Famitsu"/> The sequel added side lanes which let the car turn itself around and more complex AI.

Sega's ''Car Hunt'' (1979), informally known as ''Head On III'', added elements to the game such as a more complex maze, elevated roadways, the ability to turn in any direction, and enemy vehicles of varying aggression towards the player. The [[SG-1000]] game ''Pacar'' took elements of ''Car Hunt'' and merged them with ''[[Pac-Man]]''.

A mobile phone version of ''Head On'' was released exclusively in Japan through the Sonic Cafe, Puyo Puyo Sega, and Sega Ages portal during the 2000s.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2002-10-03 |title=Webpage of Sega Games portal (October 2002) |url=http://sega.jp/game/ |access-date=2023-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021003211807/http://sega.jp/game/ |archive-date=2002-10-03 |language=ja}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2002-10-04 |title=Webpage of Sonic Cafe Portal edition of Head On (October 2002) |url=http://www.sonicteam.com/cafe/index.html |access-date=2023-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021004215338/http://www.sonicteam.com/cafe/index.html |archive-date=2002-10-04 |language=ja}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2006-07-14 |title=Webpage of Sega Ages portal for Willcom (July 2006) |url=http://sega.jp:80/kt/willcom/segaages/home.html |access-date=2023-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714160349/http://sega.jp:80/kt/willcom/segaages/home.html |archive-date=2006-07-14 |language=ja}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2008-02-12 |title=Webpage of Puyo Puyo Sega (February 2008) |url=http://sega.jp:80/kt/docomo/puyosega/ |access-date=2023-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212053114/http://sega.jp:80/kt/docomo/puyosega/ |archive-date=2008-02-12 |language=ja}}</ref>

===Clones===
''Crash'' (1979) by [[Exidy]] was announced month after ''Head On'' was released in the United States.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=June 1979 |title=Exidy Brings You Crash |magazine=RePlay Magazine |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=27}}</ref> This led to Sega/Gremlin contacting Exidy and having the game discontinued.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=1979-11-15 |title=Exidy appoints factory distributors |magazine=Play Meter |volume=5 |issue=21 |pages=97}}</ref> Despite this, ''Crash'' was the seventh highest-grossing arcade game of 1979 in the United States and Exidy followed it up with similar games such as ''Targ'' (1980).<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Winners of '79: Top Videos |magazine=[[Play Meter]] |year=1979}}</ref>

Licensed clones were developed based on ''Head-On'' in Japan. Licensees included [[Irem]] and [[Nintendo]] who modified and released their version as {{nihongo|''Head On N''|ヘッド・オン・Ｎ|Heddo On N}}.<ref>Gorges, Florent (2010).

[[Namco]]'s ''[[Rally-X]]'' was heavily inspired by ''Head On''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Alexander |title=They Create Worlds |date=November 19, 2019 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9780429752612 |pages=587―589}}</ref><ref name="Gamest1">{{cite book |title=ザ・ベストゲーム 月刊ゲーメスト7月号増刊 |date=July 1, 1991 |publisher=[[Gamest]] |edition=Volume 6, Number 7 |pages=175―266 |language=ja |asin=B00BHEECW0}}</ref> [[Konami]]'s ''[[Fast Lane (video game)|Fast Lane]]'' arcade game, released in 1987, highly resembles ''Head On'' with improved graphics and some additional features.

''Head On'' proved a popular concept to clone for home systems. Clones include ''Tunnels of Fahad'' for the [[TRS-80]],<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=U.S-80 |url=https://archive.org/details/80-U.S._Volume_IV_Number_2_1981-03_80-Northwest_Publishing_US/page/n39/mode/2up |last=Liddil |first=Bob |title=Captain 80 |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=March 1981}}</ref> ''[[Car Wars (video game)|Car Wars]]'' for the [[TI-99/4A]],  ''Killer Car'' for [[Spectravideo]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Killer Car for Spectravideo |url=https://www.video-games-museum.com/en/game/Killer-Car/138/3/62291 |website=Video Games Museum}}</ref> ''Car Chase'' for the [[ZX Spectrum]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Car Chase |url=https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/10464/ZX-Spectrum/Car_Chase |website=Spectrum Computing}}</ref> ''[[Dodge 'Em]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]], and ''[[Dodge Racer]]'' for [[Atari 8-bit computers]]. The number of lanes in these games varies from 3 to 6.
