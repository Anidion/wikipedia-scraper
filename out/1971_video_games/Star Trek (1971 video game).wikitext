'''''Star Trek''''' is a [[text-based game|text-based]] [[strategy video game]] based on the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' television series (1966–69) and originally released in 1971. In the game, the player commands the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] on a mission to hunt down and destroy an invading fleet of [[Klingon]] warships. The player travels through the 64 [[Galactic quadrant|quadrants]] of [[Milky Way|the galaxy]] to attack enemy ships with [[weapons in Star Trek#Energy weapons|phasers]] and [[weapons in Star Trek#Photon torpedo|photon torpedoes]] in [[turn-based gaming|turn-based]] battles and refuel at [[starbase]]s. The goal is to eliminate all enemies within a random time limit.

Mike Mayfield wrote the game in the [[BASIC]] programming language for the [[SDS Sigma series|SDS Sigma 7]] [[mainframe computer]] with the goal of creating a game like ''[[Spacewar!]]'' (1962) that could be played with a [[teleprinter]] instead of a graphical display. He then rewrote it for the [[HP Time-Shared BASIC|HP 2000C]] [[minicomputer]] in 1972, and it was included in [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s public domain software catalog the following year. It was picked up from there by [[David H. Ahl]], who [[porting|ported]] it with Mary Cole to [[BASIC-PLUS]] and published the [[source code]] in the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] ''Edu'' newsletter. It was republished with other computer games in his best-selling ''[[BASIC Computer Games|101 BASIC Computer Games]]'' book. Bob Leedom then expanded the game in 1974 into ''Super Star Trek''.

Ahl left DEC and started ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]]'' magazine in 1974. He began porting the games from ''101'' to [[Microsoft BASIC]], with the exception of ''Star Trek'', where he ported Leedom's version rather than Mayfield's original. The result was released in 1978 under the new name ''BASIC Computer Games'', just as the first [[microcomputer]]s able to run the game were coming to market. ''BASIC Computer Games'' went on to become the first million-selling computer book, and versions of the game were available for almost all [[personal computer]]s of the era. Additionally, dozens of variants and expansions were made for a variety of other systems, based either on Leedom's or the original Mayfield versions.

==Gameplay==
''Star Trek'' is a [[text-based game|text-based]] [[strategy video game]] based on the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' television series in which the player, controlling the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] starship, flies through the galaxy and hunts down [[Klingon]] warships within a time limit. The game starts with a short text description of the mission before allowing the player to enter commands. Each game starts with a different number of Klingons, friendly [[starbase]]s, and stars spread throughout the galaxy. The galaxy is depicted as an 8-by-8 grid of "quadrants". Each quadrant is further divided into an 8-by-8 grid of "sectors". The number of stars, Klingons, and starbases in any one quadrant is set at the start of the game, but their exact position changes each time the player enters that quadrant.<ref name="Register"/><ref name="ahl_CC"/>

The player can view a text-based map of the current quadrant by issuing the short-range scan command. Stars, Klingon ships, starbases, and the ''Enterprise'' itself are shown as text-based figures in a square grid; the ''Enterprise'', for example, is represented with <code>-E-</code>. The player can also use the long-range scan to print out a map of the quadrants lying directly around the ''Enterprise'', with a list of the number of stars, Klingons, and starbases in each quadrant. The player moves between and within quadrants with the [[warp drive]].<ref name="Register"/><ref name="ahl_CC"/>

Klingon ships can be attacked with either [[weapons in Star Trek#Energy weapons|phasers]] or [[weapons in Star Trek#Photon torpedo|photon torpedoes]]. Phasers do not have to be aimed, but their power and therefore damage amount falls off with distance, and the player must select how much power to put into each shot. Torpedoes do not suffer this drop in power and will destroy a Klingon ship with a single hit, but have to be aimed using [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]].<ref name="Register"/><ref name="ahl_CC"/> Later versions of the game expanded on this combat system by adding features such as Klingon ships moving after each shot if not destroyed, enemy attacks damaging systems such as scanners or shields, stars absorbing torpedoes that hit them, and a calculator to help in determining the proper angle to fire the torpedoes.<ref name="ahl_CC"/><ref name="MayfieldInt"/> Combat is turn-based, and Klingon ships will fire back at the player in their turn.<ref name="ahl_CC"/>

Movement, combat, and shields all drain the energy supply of the ''Enterprise'', which can be restored by flying to a starbase.<ref name="ahl_CC"/> In some versions of the game, there are additional options for emergency situations, such as calling for help from a starbase, using the experimental Death Ray, loading raw dilithium crystals into the warp drive, or abandoning ship. Movement commands take up time depending on how far the player is moving.<ref name="MayfieldInt"/> The game ends when the ''Enterprise'' is destroyed, all Klingons are destroyed, or the time limit runs out. A score in the form of a ranking is presented at the end of the game based on energy usage, damage taken and inflicted, and any remaining time.<ref name="Register"/><ref name="ahl_CC"/>

==Development==

===''Star Trek''===
[[File:ASR-33 at CHM.agr.jpg|thumb|ASR-33 teleprinter [[computer terminal]]]]
In 1971, Mike Mayfield, then in his final year of high school, frequented a computer lab at the [[University of California, Irvine]] while teaching himself how to program. The lab operated both a [[SDS Sigma series|SDS Sigma 7]] and a [[PDP-10|DEC PDP-10]] [[mainframe computer]]. The PDP-10 hosted a copy of ''[[Spacewar!]]'', a multiplayer space combat video game developed in 1962 in the [[early history of video games]]. Mayfield had gained illicit access to the Sigma 7 at the lab and wanted to create his own version of the game for the system. ''Spacewar!'' required a [[vector graphics]] display, however, and the Sigma 7 only had access to a non-graphical [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR [[teleprinter]].<ref name="TCC243"/>

Mayfield decided to create a game in the vein of ''Spacewar!'' that could be played on a teleprinter and brainstormed several ideas with his friends. As none of the group had much experience with computers, most of the ideas were unfeasible, but one concept he liked and thought was possible was a game based on ''Star Trek'', then in syndication on television. The concept included the game printing a map of the galaxy and a map of the local star system, and phaser weapons whose attack power declined over distance. Mayfield began to program the game, creating a [[punched tape]] of the game at the end of each programming session and loading it back into the computer the next day. He worked on the game through the rest of the school year and into the summer after graduating.<ref name="MayfieldInt"/>

Later that summer, Mayfield purchased an [[HP-35]] calculator and often visited the local [[Hewlett-Packard]] sales office. The staff there offered to let him use the [[HP Time-Shared BASIC|HP 2000C]] [[minicomputer]] at the office if he would create a version of his ''Star Trek'' game for it; as the version of the [[BASIC]] programming language on the computer was different from the Sigma 7, he elected to abandon the Sigma 7 version and rewrite the program from scratch. He completed it on October 20, 1972, and the game was added to the HP public domain Contributed Program library of software as ''STTR1'' in February 1973, with Mayfield attributing the game to Centerline Engineering, a company he was considering starting.<ref name="Register" /><ref name="MayfieldInt"/> It was also published in the [[People's Computer Company]] newsletter, and republished in their collection book, ''What to Do After You Hit Return'' (1975).<ref name="Return"/>

[[David H. Ahl]] was an employee in the education department of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC). He had begun the ''Edu'' newsletter where user-submitted games became a major draw. He and fellow employee Mary Cole [[porting|ported]] ''STTR1'' to DEC's [[BASIC-PLUS]] in the summer of 1973, with some additions, and he published this version in the newsletter. Ahl attributed the game to "Mike Mayfield of Centerline Engineering and/or Custom Data".<ref name="MayfieldInt"/> In late 1973, Ahl collected many of the game submissions in the book ''[[BASIC Computer Games|101 BASIC Computer Games]]'', containing descriptions and the [[source code]] for many [[early mainframe games]]. ''101 BASIC Computer Games'' was a landmark title in computer games programming, and was a best-selling title with more than 10,000 copies sold &mdash; more copies than there were computers in existence at the time. As such, the BASIC ports of mainframe computer games included in the book were often more long-lived than their original versions or other mainframe computer games.<ref name="TIME"/> He included ''Star Trek'' in the book as ''SPACWR'', i.e. ''Space War''.<ref name="ahl_CC"/>

===''Super Star Trek''===
In early 1974, Bob Leedom saw Ahl's version of the game in ''101 BASIC Computer Games'' while working with a [[Data General Nova|Data General Nova 800]] minicomputer at [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] and, having never seen a ''Star Trek'' game before, started porting it to the system. After he got the game running, he began to expand it with suggestions from his friends. He changed the user interface, replacing the original game's numeric codes with three-letter commands and adding status reports from show characters and names for the galaxy quadrants, and overhauled the gameplay, adding moving Klingon ships, navigation and fire control options, and an expanded library computer. Once it was completed, he wrote a letter to the People's Computer Company newsletter describing the game.<ref name="MayfieldInt"/>

Ahl, who by then had left DEC to start ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]]'' magazine, saw Leedom's description in the newsletter and contacted him to publish the game in his magazine. Ahl ported it to [[Microsoft BASIC]] and published the source code of the game as ''Super Star Trek'' to distinguish it from the original ''Star Trek'' game, calling it "by far the best" version. He later included it under that name in the 1976 anthology ''The Best of Creative Computing'' as well as the 1978 edition of ''101 BASIC Computer Games'', retitled ''BASIC Computer Games''. He added a note that he had permission from the rights holders to use the show's name in the title alongside a longer note written by Leedom explaining why the galaxy had 64 quadrants even though the term suggested there should only be four.<ref name="ahl_CC" /><ref name="MayfieldInt"/><ref name="ahl_STAR"/> ''BASIC Computer Games'' was the first million-selling computer book, giving Leedom's version a much wider audience than Mayfield and Ahl's original versions.<ref name="TIME"/>

==Reception and legacy==
{{rquote|right|Everybody under the sun has been programming games based loosely on Star Trek.|''BYTE'', 1977<ref name="Price"/>}}
''Star Trek'', especially the ''Super Star Trek'' version, was immensely popular for the era.<ref name="GShistory"/><ref name="BOCC162"/> By 1975 it had spread to mainframes across the United States, and Ahl stated in 1978 in ''BASIC Computer Games'' that it was difficult to find a computer installation that did not contain a version of ''Star Trek''.<ref name="ahl_STAR"/><ref name="GShistory"/> By 1980, ''Star Trek'' was described by Mark Herro in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'' magazine as "one of the most popular (if not the most popular) computer games around", with "literally scores of different versions of this game floating around".<ref name="Games_TEE"/> At least one published work of fiction that year mentioned the game, the short story "Another Game of Spacewar", published in an anthology by ''Creative Computing''.<ref name="35stories1980"/> A 2013 overview of the game and its myriad versions in ''[[The Register]]'' by Tony Smith concluded that "like most games of the period it was fun to play once or twice, but it lacked staying power." Regardless, for the players of the time period when it was released, it was "a shiny new gateway to '[[Where no man has gone before|strange new worlds]]'".<ref name="Register"/>

The widespread popularity of the game, especially ''Super Star Trek'', along with the availability of the source code, led to numerous ports of both versions of the game for mainframe and [[microcomputer]]s.<ref name="Register" /><ref name="MayfieldInt"/><ref name="Spacetrek"/> Alternate versions of the game were also produced, based on ''Star Trek'', ''Super Star Trek'', or both. David Matuszek and Paul Reynolds wrote an expanded [[Fortran]] version of the original game as ''UT Super Star Trek''; [[Eric Allman]] ported this version to the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] to become ''BSD Trek'', which is still included in the [[Debian]] classic [[Unix]] games package.<ref name="Register"/><ref name="Debian"/> ''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' published a BASIC version by David Price in March 1977 that used the original command system based on numbers.<ref name="Price"/> In 1983 ''BYTE'' columnist [[Jerry Pournelle]] claimed to have written "the world's most complex ''Star Trek'' game" in [[CBASIC]].<ref name="pournelle"/> A [[shareware]] version for [[MS-DOS]], ''EGATrek'', was released in the late 1980s that replaced the original text-based screens with basic graphics that implemented a multi-paned display.<ref name="EGAtrek"/> In 2017, ''[[PC Gamer]]'' ranked ''EGATrek'' among the best ''Star Trek'' games.<ref name="PCGamer"/>
[[File:Star trek ascii vt100 game (29645819581).jpg|thumb|A TRS-80 port of the game running at the [[Living Computers: Museum + Labs]]]]
Multiple commercial versions of the game were released in addition to the free ports. [[Apple Inc.]] released a version for the [[Apple II Plus|Apple II+]] called ''Apple Trek'' in 1979, and [[Atari, Inc.]] released a version for the [[Atari 2600]] as ''[[Stellar Track]]'' in 1980. The TRS-80 had at least three separate commercially available Star Trek games, including ''[[Trek-80]]'' by [[Processor Technology]] (later retitled ''Invasion Force'') which added more interactivity and a number of new options incorporated from the unrelated ''[[Trek73]]'', a second ''[[Trek-80 (1979 video game)|Trek-80]]'' by [[Judges Guild]], and ''Startrek 3.5'' from [[Adventure International]].<ref name="Register"/><ref name="TRS80"/><ref name="DragonTrek80"/> [[Acornsoft]] released a version titled ''Galaxy'' for their computer systems, and [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy Computers]] released ''Space Trek'' for theirs.<ref name="Register"/> Yet another version was written in [[IBM BASIC|BASICA]] for the [[IBM Personal Computer]] in 1982, ''[[Video Trek 88]]''; written by [[Windmill Software]], it used numbers for most commands, like the earlier ''BYTE'' version.<ref name="videotrek"/> Apex Software released ''TI-Trek'' for the [[TI-99/4A]] in 1983, which incorporates speech if the speech synthesizer is present.<ref name="TItrek"/> 1984's ''[[Star Fleet I: The War Begins]]'' by Interstel was a variant released commercially for several computer systems. This game was successful enough to spawn a [[Star Fleet (video game series)|series]].<ref name="sfleet"/>

Numerous hobby projects have continued to port the original game versions and enhanced variants to other languages and systems through to today.<ref name="Register"/><ref name="TimeExt"/> Additionally, some commercial games have been inspired by ''Star Trek'', such as ''[[Star Raiders]]'' (1980), which was initially designed as a real time, 3D version of the game.<ref name="SR1"/><ref name="SR2"/> As late as 1994, the collective ''Star Trek'' variants were still popular enough that ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' claimed that the otherwise unrelated ''Stellar Explorer''{{'}}s gameplay was directly based on it, and that "anyone who remembers the old ''Trek'' games[...] will know exactly what this game is all about".<ref name="cgw199405"/>
