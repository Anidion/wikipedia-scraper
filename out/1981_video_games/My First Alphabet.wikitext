'''''My First Alphabet''''' is an [[educational video game]] for [[Atari 8-bit computers]]. It was designed and programmed by Fernando Herrera and published by the [[Atari Program Exchange]] in 1981. ''My First Alphabet'' won the first [[Atari Star Award]], an annual recognition of the best APX submission.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/1982-04-compute-magazine |title=Compute!

Herrera's son, Steve, was born with severe [[cataracts]] and was pronounced blind by medical specialists. Refusing to place his son in remedial classes, Herrera wrote a program to help his son learn the alphabet.<ref name=":0" /> After several months, his son made rapid progress, overcoming his handicap. The program later evolved into ''My First Alphabet''.

==Reception==
When Atari began recognizing the top APX submissions in 1981, ''My First Alphabet'' was the first [[Atari Star Award]] winner, including a $25,000 prize. Herrera used the money to found [[First Star Software]]. Herrerra wrote First Star's initial title, ''[[Astro Chase]]'' (1982), as well as  ''[[Bristles (video game)|Bristles]]'' (1983). First Star was the publisher of ''[[Boulder Dash (video game)|Boulder Dash]]'' (1984) and ''[[Spy vs. Spy (1984 video game)|Spy vs. Spy]]'' (1984).
