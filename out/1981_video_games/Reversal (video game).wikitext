==Reception==
Bob Boyd reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "Othello is a classic strategy game. This is an accurate adaptation for the computer with various features to enhance the game. ''Reversal'' plays quickly and easily, the graphics are good, and the computer can be hard to beat. It is excellent and I recommend it."<ref name="CGW1">{{cite magazine |last=Boyd |first=Bob |title=Micro - Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=November–December 1981 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=31–32}}</ref>
