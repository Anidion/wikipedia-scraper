==Reception==
Luther Shaw reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "here's another in the long line of aliens-dropping-from-the-skies-being-destroyed-by-your-weapons games. While many versions of the ADFTSBDBYW type of game are very similar to the coin arcade games that they were based upon, this one has a flavor all {{sic|it's}} own."<ref name="CGW2">{{cite magazine |last=Shaw |first=Luther |title=Micro - Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Januaryâ€“February 1982 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=28}}</ref>
