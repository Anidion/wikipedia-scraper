'''''Crossfire''''' is a [[multidirectional shooter]] created by Jay Sullivan for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Sierra Entertainment|On-Line Systems]] in 1981.<ref name=giantlist/> Using keyboard-based [[twin-stick shooter]] controls, the player maneuvers a ship in a grid-like maze. Versions with joystick-control use the stick for movement and switch to firing mode when the button is held down.

''Crossfire'' was ported to [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[VIC-20]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] (as a [[self-booting disk]]). A cartridge version was a 1984 [[launch title]] for the [[IBM PCjr]], announced in late 1983.<ref name="wiswell19840124">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&pg=PA142 | title=Coming Soon: Games For The PCjr | work=PC | date=1984-01-24 | accessdate=26 January 2015 | author=Wiswell, Phil | pages=142–145}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}
The player uses the [[IJKL]] keys to move or the joystick (the Atari and Commodore versions are joystick only) and [[Arrow keys#ESDF keys|ESDF]] to shoot left, right, up, and down{{r|tommervik198201}} through the pathways on an evenly-spaced grid of blocks, avoiding incoming fire and dispatching enemies. The player can move and fire in four directions, but can only stop in intersections. The player advances a level when all enemies are destroyed.

Along the left, right, and top sides of the playfield are 16 pockets which release enemies. These enemies emerge and move among the blocks, firing at and attempting to collide with the player. The four types of enemies differ only in appearance, not in power or behavior, and are worth 10, 20, 40, and 80 points respectively. Enemies move and fire in four directions, but are slower than the player and never run out of [[ammunition]].

Within four blocks near the middle of the playfield are orange, spindle-shaped bonus items. Once the player has fired 12 times (after the beginning of the level or after collecting the previous bonus), the item emerges from its block. If it has not been collected after 6 shots, it returns to its block, and no further bonus items will appear in that level. Capturing the bonus items grants 100, 200, 400, and 800 points.

The player can fire a limited number of shots before having to reload. This starts at 35 and decreases by 5 each level until 15. When 10 shots remain, a cluster of four pulsing white dots appears which reloads the player's ammunition. Only one shot can be in the air at a time.

Play begins with three ships, and an extra ship is awarded every 5,000 points.

==Ports==
The Atari 8-bit had a separate cartridge and magnetic media release; the cartridge version runs on a 16k machine and uses character mode graphics while the magnetic media version needs 32k, runs in a bitmap mode, and duplicates the Apple II graphics. The Commodore 64 release had background music which is absent from other versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-8-bit/crossfire/screenshots|title = Crossfire (1981) screenshots}}</ref> 

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' called ''Crossfire'' "a new twist on arcade games with delightfully colorful beasties and smooth animation", which "offers hours of challenge and enjoyment for the dedicated and persevering gamester".<ref name="tommervik198201">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=6&id=3 | title=Crossfire | work=Softline | date=January 1982 | accessdate=13 July 2014 | author=Tommervik, Art | pages=15}}</ref> ''[[BYTE]]'' called ''Crossfire'' "one of the most difficult and challenging arcade games to play ...

It described the IBM PC version's graphics as "adequate, but nothing spectacular", and the controls as imprecise and inelegant.<ref name="pc198302">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wCiNAUEuAMC&pg=PA194 | title=The Organization Man Meets Pac-Man | work=PC Magazine | date=February 1983 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author1=van Gelder, Lindsy | author2=Sandler, Corey | pages=194}}</ref>

In March 1983, the Atari 8-bit computer version of ''Crossfire'' received a Certificate of Merit in the category of "Best Arcade/Action Computer Games" at the 4th annual [[Arkie Awards]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= March 1983 |title= Arcade Alley: The Best Computer Games |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 12|pages= 32–33|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|32}} but reviews for other versions were mixed. ''[[Ahoy!]]''{{'}}s review was critical, stating "do we really need a bare bones grid shooting game (the VIC graphics are absolutely starved), with no character or atmosphere?"<ref name="michaels198404">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_04_1984-04_Ion_International_US#page/n59/mode/2up | title=Cross Fire | work=Ahoy! | date=April 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Michaels, R.
