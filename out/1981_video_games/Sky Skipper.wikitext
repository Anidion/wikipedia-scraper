{{nihongo foot|'''''Sky Skipper'''''|スカイスキッパー|Sukai Sukippā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1981 [[arcade video game]] by [[Nintendo]]. The player pilots a biplane and must save animals and a royal family from gorillas holding them captured. This is done by dropping bombs on the gorillas to knock them out and unlock the cages, then diving down towards the cages to pick up the freed characters before the gorillas lock the cages again. An [[Atari 2600]] port was released in 1983.

The game was poorly received in location testing and was never widely released. The cabinets were converted into ''[[Popeye (video game)|Popeye]]'' machines for release the following year. Nintendo of America stored one cabinet in its archives which is now the only known ''Sky Skipper'' cabinet remaining in the world. The cabinet was scanned and photographed by arcade enthusiasts in 2016, who also sourced one of four known remaining ''Sky Skipper'' arcade boards to build a faithful cabinet restoration. The board from the Nintendo of America cabinet is the only known unmodified boardset of the game. [[Hamster Corporation]] copied the [[ROM image]] from this board and released it on the [[Nintendo Switch]] eShop under license from Nintendo in 2018 as part of the [[Arcade Archives]] series of digital download titles.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Sky skipper screenshot.png|left|thumb|A player attacks a gorilla (arcade version)]]

In ''Sky Skipper'', the player pilots a [[biplane]] through scrolling mazes to save animals caged by enemy gorillas. The player must drop bombs onto the gorillas which will temporarily knock them out and unlock the cages. Then, the player must swoop down to pick up the animals before the gorillas get up and lock the cages again. Flying into a gorilla or wall destroys the plane, resulting in the loss of one [[Life (gaming)|life]]. The plane's fuel gauge goes down while flying, and is replenished by picking up the animals. There are four stages in total, which are repeated on increased difficulty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9575|title=Sky Skipper - Videogame by Nintendo|website=The International Arcade Museum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014052650/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9575|archive-date=October 14, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=June 23, 2018}}</ref>

In 1981, [[Nintendo]] developed and released ''Sky Skipper'' in Japan; the game was produced alongside Nintendo's highly successful ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' arcade game, with both titles releasing in July of the same year.<ref name = "game-machine" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite

During [[E3 2018]], Nintendo revealed the impending release of ''Sky Skipper'' on the [[Nintendo Switch]] eShop in July under the ''[[Arcade Archives]]'' series run by [[Hamster Corporation]]. The ROM image for the game had been copied from the board in the cabinet at Nintendo of America because it is the only known unmodified boardset.<ref name=":3" /> According to ''Nintendo World Report'', the rerelease may have taken years to come to fruition due to legal issues with Ikegami Tsushinki.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/47843/arcade-archives-sky-skipper-switch-review|title=Arcade Archives Sky Skipper Review - Review|last=Berube|first=Justin|date=July 26, 2018|website=Nintendo World Report|access-date=August 26, 2018}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Reviewing the Switch release, both ''Nintendo World Report'' and ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' said the game was enjoyable when playing for a high score, but it lacked variety.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_sky_skipper|title=Review: Arcade Archives Sky Skipper (Switch eShop)|last=Frear|first=Dave|date=July 25, 2018|work=Nintendo Life|access-date=August 26, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> ''Nintendo Life'' enjoyed "striking a balance between completing the levels quickly and plotting a route to maximise your point-scoring."<ref name=":8" /> ''Nintendo World Report'' did not like how the game repeated the same few stages and felt as though the game was not finished. They also panned the stage graphics, calling them "extremely crude" compared to ''Donkey Kong''.<ref name=":7" /> ''Nintendo Life'' agreed in that the colors were garish in places and the environments were blocky, writing this: "The simple design and plain backgrounds ensure everything is easy to follow, but ''Sky Skipper'' certainly shows its age."<ref name=":8" /> Both praised the extra options included with the ''Arcade Archives'' release.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8" />

Having played the vintage arcade, Nintendo of America's gameplay tester [[Howard Phillips (consultant)|Howard Philips]] called ''Sky Skipper'' a "confusing thematic mess"<ref name=":9" /> akin to an [[LSD]] trip.<ref name="MGC 2019 Howard">{{cite video | title=MGC 2019 - Howard Phillips and Frank Cifaldi Interview | work=Hair of the Dogcast | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pqpQcdFDR4  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/3pqpQcdFDR4 |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live| date=May 1, 2019 | via=YouTube | access-date=July 10, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>{{rp|12:55}}

''Atari HQ'' found the vintage Atari 2600 port to be average, with simple gameplay and unremarkable graphics and sound.<ref name=":6" />

[[Julian Eggebrecht]], founder of game developer [[Factor 5]], made a deal with Nintendo that if he was able to ship ''[[Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader]]'' (2001) on schedule, he could borrow their ''Sky Skipper'' cabinet for his company's arcade. Factor 5 shipped ''Rogue Leader'' on time and so received the machine. One of the ROM chips was dead, so they contacted Genyo Takeda who pulled the original files from Nintendo's archives, enabling Eggebrecht to repair the machine.<ref name=":9" />

In 2016, a group of arcade restoration enthusiasts decided to build a restored ''Sky Skipper'' cabinet.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/09/sky_skipper_project_aims_to_revive_a_rare_nintendo_arcade_game|title=Sky Skipper Project Aims to Revive a Rare Nintendo Arcade Game|last=Whitehead|first=Thomas|date=September 19, 2016|work=Nintendo Life|access-date=June 23, 2018|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113102300/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/09/sky_skipper_project_aims_to_revive_a_rare_nintendo_arcade_game|archive-date=January 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> No complete cabinets were known to exist in private collections.
