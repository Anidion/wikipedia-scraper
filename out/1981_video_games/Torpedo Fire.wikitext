I hope they find their way again soon."<ref name="SG"/> In ''Video Games'', Rich Sutton said playability concerns meant that he "only recommended [''Torpedo Fire''] for the advanced player who desires the most accurate simulation on the market".<ref name=videogames>{{cite journal | author=Sutton, Rich | title=War Games: A Battle Plan for Attacking Video Simulations | volume=2 | number=1 | date=October 1993 | journal=Video Games | pages=40, 41, 44–48 }}</ref>

==Legacy==
In early 1982, designer [[Gary Grigsby]] got his break in the game industry when he called Strategic Simulations' hotline with a question about ''Torpedo Fire'', which he owned a copy of at the time. Getting into a conversation with company head [[Joel Billings]] paved the way for SSI's release of Grigsby's title ''[[Guadalcanal Campaign (video game)|Guadalcanal Campaign]]''.<ref name=witeint>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203052400/http://www.wargamer.com/article/2983/war-in-the-east-developers | url=http://www.wargamer.com/article/2983/war-in-the-east-developers | title=Interview: ''War in the East'' Developers | date=January 23, 2011 | author=Staff | work=[[Wargamer (website)|Wargamer]] | archivedate=February 3, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>
