==Gameplay==
''Mole Attack'' is a game in which moles pop up from nine holes, and the player has 60 seconds to send them back underground by bopping them on the head with a hammer, which is controlled with the joystick or the keyboard.<ref name="komar198306"/>

==Reception==
In a 1983 review for ''[[Electronic Games]]'', Charlene Komar commented, "''Mole Attack'' will probably be a favorite among younger arcaders. Even though the eye-catching graphics combine well with the time-limit excitement, adults will probably find the game too simple and repetitive to get too many repeat plays."<ref name="komar198306">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n67/mode/2up | title=Mole Attack | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=6 January 2015 | author=Komar, Charlene | pages=70}}</ref>
