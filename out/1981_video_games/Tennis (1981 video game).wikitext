'''''Tennis''''' is a [[sports video game]] for the [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] (later called the Atari 2600) which was written by [[Activision]] co-founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] and published by Activision in [[1981 in video gaming|1981]].<ref name=giantlist/>

==Gameplay==

''Tennis'' offers [[Tennis singles|singles matches]] for one or two players; one player is colored pink, the other blue. The game has two user-selectable speed levels.<ref name="manual"/> When serving and returning [[Tennis shots|shots]], the tennis players automatically swing [[forehand]] or [[backhand]] as the situation demands, and all shots automatically clear the net and land in bounds.<ref name="manual"/>

The first player to win one six-game [[Set (tennis)|set]] is declared the winner of the match (if the set ends in a 6-6 tie, the set restarts from 0-0). This differs from professional tennis, in which player must win at least two out of three six-game sets.

==Reception==
''Tennis'' received an award for "Best Competitive Game" and an [[honorable mention]] for "Best Sports Game" at the 3rd annual [[Arkie Awards]]. Arkie Award judges commented that "''Tennis'' is as far removed from the primitive ''[[Pong]]''-style games from which it derives as [[gasoline]] is from the dinosaurs", and specific praise was given to the game's "realistic illusion of depth" and its competitive aspects which allow for "hard fought contest[s]" and "glorious comebacks from the brink of defeat" and which give "more methodical players a chance to taste victory against the kings and queens of [[hand-eye coordination]]".<ref name=kunkel82jan/>{{rp|76}}

Covered in [[Video (magazine)|''Video'' magazine]]'s 1982 Guide to Electronic Games, ''Tennis'' was characterized by critics as "not terribly complicated," but also as "one of the few very good sports games for the [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]]".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= November 1982 |title= Video's Guide to Electronic Games |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 8|pages= 47–56, 108|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|52}}
