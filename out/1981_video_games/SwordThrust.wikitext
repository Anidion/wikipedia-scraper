== Premise ==
Players take on the role of a warrior/adventurer in the magical, feudal world of Diurla.  Play begins at the Main Hall of the Guild of Free Rogues, where the player creates a character, buys equipment and learns spells before venturing out to gain wealth and experience.  Each scenario has a different goal, and typically a time limit. A save option is available, allowing the player to suspend the game and pick it up later.<ref name="manual">{{cite web

It has flaws, but so does every milestone."<ref name="SG43"/>

Dale Archibald reviewed ''Sword Thrust #1: The King's Testing Ground'' in ''[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]]'' #14 and commented that "if gothic, nurse, mystery and western writers can publish four books at a time about a character, why can't a software publisher? It's an attractive idea, if you've got a good character and good plots. Brown has the best character going: you. And his plots are interesting."<ref name="Ares">{{cite journal | last=Archibald | first=Dale| title=Software | journal=[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]] | publisher=[[TSR, Inc.]] | date=Spring 1983| issue=14 | page=47}}</ref>
