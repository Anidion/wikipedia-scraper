'''''Colony 7''''' is an [[Arcade video game|arcade]] [[shoot 'em up]] developed and published by [[Taito]]'s American division in 1981. It contains elements of both ''[[Space Invaders]]'' (developed by Taito of Japan) and [[Atari, Inc.]]'s ''[[Missile Command]]''. ''Colony 7'' was the inspiration for the successful [[Atari 2600]] game ''[[Atlantis (video game)|Atlantis]]'' from Imagic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arcade Legends: Space Invaders manual|url=http://service.mattel.com/instruction_sheets/I4064.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Look at Arcade Ports on Retro Consoles Today|url=http://arcadeheroes.com/2008/02/23/a-look-at-arcade-ports-coming-to-retro-consoles-today/|website=Arcade Heroes|date=2008-02-23}}</ref>

The main innovation of ''Colony 7'' was its extended weaponry arsenal.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} This gave the player the choice to change between several different weapons, with each one needing to be purchased separately as [[microtransaction]]s through the arcade coin slot.

The game was re-released as part of ''[[Taito Legends]]''.
