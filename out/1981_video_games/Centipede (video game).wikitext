'''''Centipede''''' is a 1981 [[fixed shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Atari, Inc.]]<ref name="Copyright">{{cite web |title=Centipede (Registration Number PA0000108068) |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov |website=[[United States Copyright Office]] |access-date=24 May 2021}}</ref> Designed by [[Dona Bailey]] and [[Ed Logg]], it was one of the most commercially successful games from the [[golden age of arcade video games]] and one of the first with a [[Women and video games|significant female player base]]. The primary objective is to shoot all the segments of a centipede that winds down the playing field. An arcade sequel, ''[[Millipede (video game)|Millipede]]'', followed in 1982.

''Centipede'' was ported to Atari's own [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[Atari 7800]], and [[Atari 8-bit computers]]. Under the [[Atarisoft]] label, the game was sold for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ColecoVision]], [[VIC-20]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] (as a [[self-booting disk]]), [[Intellivision]], and [[TI-99/4A]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://4apedia.com/index.php?title=Centipede |title=TI-99/4A-Pedia: Centipede |access-date=2020-06-06}}</ref> [[Superior Software]] published the port for the [[BBC Micro]]. Versions for the [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] were also produced, as well as a version for the short-lived [[Game.com]] developed by [[Handheld Games]] and published by [[Tiger Electronics]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Centipede arcade.png|thumb|left|A new game, with the centipede at the top and a spider in the lower right]]

The player controls the small insect-like creature called the ''Bug Blaster''. It is moved around the bottom area of the screen with a [[trackball]] and fires small [[Dart (missile)|darts]] at a segmented [[centipede]] advancing from the top of the screen through a field of [[mushroom]]s. Each segment of the centipede becomes a mushroom when shot; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the screen, with the rear piece sprouting its own head. If the centipede head is destroyed, the segment behind it becomes the next head. Shooting the head is worth 100 points while the other segments are 10. The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. When it touches a mushroom or reaches the edge of the screen, it descends one level and reverses direction. The player can destroy mushrooms (a point each) by shooting them, but each takes four shots to destroy. At higher levels, the screen can become increasingly crowded with mushrooms due to player/enemy actions, causing the centipede to descend more rapidly.

[[File:Centipede Arcade Automat.jpg|thumb|Arcade machine]]

Once the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it stays within the player area and one-segment "head" centipedes will periodically appear from the side. This continues until the player has eliminated both the original centipede and all heads. When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, another one enters from the top of the screen. The initial centipede is 10 or 12 segments long, including the head; each successive centipede is one segment shorter and accompanied by one detached, faster-moving head. This pattern continues until all segments are separate heads, after which it repeats with a single full-length centipede.

The player also encounters other creatures besides the centipedes. [[Flea]]s drop vertically and disappear upon touching the bottom of the screen, occasionally leaving a trail of mushrooms in their path when only a few mushrooms are in the player movement area; they are worth 200 points each and take two shots to destroy. [[Spider]]s move across the player area in a zig-zag pattern and eat some of the mushrooms; they are worth 300, 600, or 900 points depending on the range they are shot from. [[Scorpion]]s move horizontally across the screen, turning every mushroom they touch into poison mushrooms. Scorpions are also worth the most points of all enemies with 1,000 points each. A centipede touching a poison mushroom will attack straight down toward the bottom, then return to normal behavior upon reaching it. This "poisoned" centipede can be both beneficial and detrimental to the player; the player can destroy them rapidly as it descends down, while at the same time, they can be very challenging to avoid, especially if already split into multiple segments.

The Bug Blaster is destroyed when hit by any enemy, after which any poisonous or partially damaged mushrooms revert to normal. 5 points are awarded for each regenerated mushroom. An extra life is awarded every 12,000 points.

===Sequels and remakes===
{{missing information|Centipede Chaos|date=June 2021}}
''Centipede'' was followed by ''[[Millipede (video game)|Millipede]]'' in 1982.

In 1992, [[Atari Games]] developed a [[prototype]] of an arcade game called ''[[Arcade Classics]]'' for their 20th anniversary, which includes ''Missile Command 2'' and ''Super Centipede'' with co-op 2-player mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=6904 |title=Arcade Classics Videogame by Atari Games (1992) - The International Arcade Museum and the KLOV |publisher=Arcade-museum.com |access-date=2011-02-09}}</ref>

A [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]] based on the original game was being developed by Dark Science for the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] under the working title ''Centipede 2000''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Willard|url=http://www.racketboy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=47770|title=Canceled Centipede RPG on Atari Jaguar CD|website=racketboy.com|date=November 4, 2014|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref> The [[source code]] of the project no longer exists and the only remaining proof of its existence is a short [[video clip]] from the developer.<ref>{{cite web|author=Willard|url=http://atariage.com/forums/topic/25828-centipede-2000/|title=Centipede 2000|website=[[AtariAge]]|date=May 4, 2003|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Reutter|first=Hans|url=http://www.cyberroach.com/jaguarcd/html/c2K.htm|title=Unreleased Or Unfinished Jaguar Games - Centipede 2000 (working title)|website=cyberroach.com|date=November 19, 2000|access-date=2018-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402084609/http://www.cyberroach.com/jaguarcd/html/c2K.htm|archive-date=2018-04-02|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O4J2hX_LaY |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/7O4J2hX_LaY| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|work=[[YouTube]]|date=January 24, 2014|author=Jean La Montarde|title=Centipede 2000 for Atari Jaguar - Engine demo}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In 1998, after acquiring the intellectual property of [[Atari]] from then-owner [[JT Storage]], [[Hasbro Interactive]] released [[Centipede (1998 video game)|a new version of the game]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Dreamcast]], and [[Mac OS]]. It is very different from the original: 3D graphics, free movement around the map, and a campaign which can be played in single-player or multiplayer mode.

In 2011, [[Atari, SA]] released ''[[Centipede: Infestation]]'' for [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Wii]].

In 2019, ICE created a remaster of ''Centipede'' known as ''Centipede Chaos'' for arcades.

In 2020, GameTaco released ''Centipede: Cash Blast'' for iOS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appadvice.com/app/atari-centipede-cash-blast/1449639446|title=Atari Centipede: Cash Blast by Game Taco, Inc}}</ref>

A revamped version of the game, titled ''Centipede: Recharged'', was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation 5]], [[Xbox One]], [[Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X/S]], [[Google Stadia]], and [[Atari VCS (2021 console)|Atari VCS]] with exclusive content in September 2021 as part of the company's ''[[Atari Recharged]]'' series.
