==Reception==
Robin D. Roberts reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "While an excellent program, the casual gamer may find his interest wane after a short time. This game is best suited for those who are interested in marketing simulations and are willing to expend the time needed to play them well."<ref name="CGW2">{{cite magazine |last=Roberts |first=Robin D. |title=Micro - Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January–February 1982 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=29, 31}}</ref>

Bob Proctor reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that " what is happening and includes strategy tips. There is enough information here to qualify this game as an introductory course for Micro-economics; in fact, at a recent seminar, ''Cartels & Cutthroats'' was shown as an example of Computer-Assisted Instruction. Don't let that fool you; it's a great game!"<ref name="CGW5">{{cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |title=We're in the Money...
