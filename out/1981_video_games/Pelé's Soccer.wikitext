'''''Pelé's Soccer''''', originally released as '''''Championship Soccer''''' (and using that name in modern compilations for [[trademark]] reasons), is a 1981 sports game from [[Atari, Inc.]] for the [[Atari 2600|Atari Video Computer System]]. Endorsed by the famous [[association football|footballer]] [[Pelé]], it features ball-handing and goal-keeping techniques using the joystick.

==Releases==
Originally planned for a 1980 holiday season release, ''Championship Soccer'' was delayed until February 1981. The game received the personal endorsement of Pelé himself, who appeared in commercials and even went on promotional tours for the game. The endorsement came late in the development process of the game, as the original release bore the ''Championship Soccer'' name on both the box and the text-label cartridge, but Pelé's name and endorsement were appended to the cover of the instruction manual. As Atari shifted to picture-label cartridges, the game's name was formally changed to ''Pelé's Soccer''.

[[Sears]], under their [[OEM]] licensing deal with Atari, Inc., released the game under their [[Atari 2600#Sears Video Arcade|Tele-Games]] brand, simply titled ''Soccer'', and using the original ''Championship Soccer'' box art; although the game program was unchanged, the Tele-Games release never bore the Pelé name.

When Atari Corp. relaunched the 2600 in 1986 alongside the [[Atari 7800|Atari 7800 ProSystem]], which was backward-compatible with the 2600, they re-released ''Pelé's Soccer'' as a budget title to bolster the consoles' lineups. These releases are notable for the modifications to the 1981 black label design, featuring a copyright date of the year of production along with "Atari Corp." replacing "Atari, Inc.", and for the printing error of "Atari Game Program Instructions" beneath the title instead of the advisory "Use with Joystick Controllers".

Modern compilations of Atari 2600 games, such as ''[[Atari Greatest Hits]]'', ''[[Atari Vault]]'', and the [[Atari Flashback series]], revert the game's name to its original title of ''Championship Soccer'' for trademark purposes, as the original endorsement deal has long expired.
