'''''Scram: A Nuclear Power Plant Simulation''''' is an educational simulation video game developed for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] in 1981.<ref name="giantlist">{{cite web|title=The Giant List of Classic Game Programmers|url=https://dadgum.com/giantlist/ |last1=Hague |first=James}}</ref> Written in [[Atari BASIC]], ''Scram'' uses [[differential equation]]s to simulate [[nuclear reactor]] behavior. The player controls the valves and switches of the reactor directly with the [[joystick]].

This game's title, "SCRAM", is taken from the term for an [[Scram|emergency shutdown of a nuclear reactor]]. It refers to immediately inserting all control rods into the reactor core to stop the reaction process.<ref name="XXX">{{cite web|title=Atari 8-bit Ads |website=A Survey of Advertisements About the Atari 8-bit family of Computers |url=https://atari8bitads.blogspot.com/2016/05/late-closing.html |date=November 7, 2006}}</ref> The game also recreates the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] Unit 2 nuclear reactor and allowed players to recreate the events that took place there in 1979.<ref name="Turner">{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Glenn|title=Gamephemera: SCRAM (Atari 400/800)|url=http://thenewgamer.com/content/archives/gamephemera_scram_atari_400_800|website=The New Games|date=May 9, 2016}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

The game display shows a [[schematic]]-like representation of a [[light water reactor]], typical of [[nuclear reactor]]s in use in the [[United States]] at that time. The reactor core is on the left of the screen, with the primary coolant loop to its immediate right. Further right is the secondary cooling loop, and finally the tertiary cooling loop and its associated [[cooling tower]].<ref name="Turner" />

The user interacts with the game by moving the joystick, which makes a cursor jump from one "hot spot" to another on the screen, each one controlling one part of the reactor systems. There are hot spots for the [[control rod]]s, cooling pumps and valves. The user can experiment with the reactor systems by moving the joystick up and down, operating the equipment. It is possible to simulate a [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] by shutting off the primary cooling pumps and withdrawing the control rods all the way.

The game has several skill levels, which control the frequency of earthquakes and the obviousness of the damage. In the event of an earthquake the screen shakes, and a breaking sound is heard if there is damage. The user then has to watch the on-screen displays to try to isolate where the problem is.

==Reception==
One big fan of ''Scram'' was [[Harold Denton]], the Director of the [[Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation]] at the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. In an interview with ''[[Atari Connection]]'' magazine, he called it "a fascinating game" and "a great tool for learning what goes on in a reactor."<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Atari Connection |url=https://archive.org/details/Atari_Connection_Volume_3_Number_3_1983-09_Atari_US |title=Nuclear troubleshooter stays sharp with Scram |date=Fall 1983 |page=[https://archive.org/details/Atari_Connection_Volume_3_Number_3_1983-09_Atari_US/page/n18 8] |first=Paul |last=Cohen}}</ref>

''Enter'' gave it a mixed review, with one reviewer calling it "not fun" while another stated it "was not fast-paced... but it's good." He concluded that "If you buy this game to learn about nuclear reactors, you'll get your money's worth and then some." while the co-reviewer concluded "But if you're buying it to have fun, you're going to be disappointed."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/enter-magazine-07 |title=SCRAM |page=[https://archive.org/details/enter-magazine-07/page/n62 61] |magazine=Enter |date=May 1984 |first1=Phil |last1=Wiswell |first2=Bernie |last2=DeKoven}}</ref>

''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' in 1981 seemed to enjoy the game overall, but criticized the documentation, calling it "needlessly wordy and confusing".<ref name="bang198111">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1981&pub=6&id=2 |title=SCRAM |magazine=Softline |date=November 1981 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |first=Derek |last=Bang | pages=26, 27}}</ref> In contrast, a review in the New Jersey Atari Computer Group (JACG) newsletter praised the extremely detailed documentation, but concluded that the game itself might be too technical for some players.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=New Jersey Atari Computer Group Newsletter |date=June 1983 |title=SCRAM |pages=[https://archive.org/details/JACGV02N10198306/page/n13 14], 15 |first=Walt |last=Morris |url=https://archive.org/details/JACGV02N10198306}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
In 2013 Crawford released the [[source code]] of several of his games, including ''Scram'', to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmatazz.com/library/source-code/index.html| title=Source Code|quote=30 months ago, at the 2011 Game Developers Conference, somebody asked me to release the source code for my old games. I said I would look into it. [...] I have begun the process of preparing my source code for general distribution. |accessdate=2017-02-24 |year=2013 |first=Chris |last=Crawford}}</ref>
