'''''Color Robot Battle''''' is a [[programming game]] developed by Glenn Sogge and Del Ogren for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] and published by [[Radio Shack]] in 1981.<ref>Hoffman, Paul [https://archive.org/stream/rainbowmagazine-1983-04/The_Rainbow_Magazine_04_1983#page/n141/mode/1up "Robots Maneuver Humans Into Programming"], The Rainbow (Apr 1983) Page 140-142. </ref>

==Robot Programming==

The aim of the game is to write a [[computer program]] that controls a (simulated) robot. Two programs are selected to do battle in an arena with the last robot standing being the winner.<ref>[http://programminggames.org/Color-Robot-Battle.ashx Color Robot Battle on the Programming Games Wiki]</ref> One of the examples from the manual follows:

 *OMEGA
 ROB> =R:XM
 WAL> =W:T-2
 START> CROB:CWAL:F8:=?:T1
 GSTART

The robot controlled by this program follows the wall of the arena making an occasional random turn to break the movement pattern. The program scans for an opponent and attacks if one is found.
