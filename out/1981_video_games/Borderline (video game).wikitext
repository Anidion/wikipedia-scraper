{{nihongo|'''''Borderline'''''|ボーダーライン|Bōdārain}} is a vertically [[scrolling shooter]] [[maze game]] released by [[Sega]] as an [[arcade video game]] in April 1981.<ref name=klov>{{KLOV game|name=Borderline|id=7194}}</ref><ref name="EU"/><ref name="Game Machine Magazine"/> The player controls a [[jeep]] and has to destroy enemy refineries. There are four stages with different gameplay. The first stage plays like a [[vertically scrolling shooter]]. In the second stage, the player maneuvers his Jeep through underbrush, and enemies can only follow on its path, a concept later found in [[Namco]]'s ''[[Dig Dug]]'' (1982).

''Borderline'' was reissued later in the year with slightly altered graphics as '''''Star Raker'''''. ''Borderline'' was a game for the [[SG-1000]] in 1984.<ref name="Game Machine MagazineSG-1000">{{cite web|title=Home Video Game Console(Japanese, top-right)|url=https://archive.org/details/game-machine-magazine-19850715p|work=Game Machine Magazine 15th July '85| date=15 July 1985 |publisher=Amusement Press Inc., Osaka, Japan|accessdate=25 August 2023}}</ref> It was converted for the [[Atari 2600]] under the name '''''Thunderground''''', released by Sega's home division;<ref>{{cite web |last1=Federico |first1=Chris |title=Thunderground |url=https://orphanedgames.com/articles/Thunderground/Thunderground.html |website=Orphaned Computers & Game Systems |date=May 30, 2016 |access-date=26 April 2021}}</ref> it was one of the last games Sega released as a [[third-party developer]] for Atari.<ref name="VI"/> The SG-1000 and Atari 2600 ports received positive reviews from critics.

==Reception==
E.C. Meade and Jim Clark of ''[[Videogaming Illustrated]]'' magazine reviewed the Atari 2600 version ''Thunderground'' in 1983.<ref name="VI">{{cite magazine |last1=Meade |first1=E.C. |last2=Clark |first2=Jim |title=Thunderground (Sega for the 2600) |magazine=[[Videogaming Illustrated]] |date=December 1983 |page=14 |url=https://archive.org/details/Videogaming_and_Computer_Gaming_Illustrated_1983-12_Ion_International_US/page/n13/mode/1up}}</ref> Despite the original ''Borderline'' predating ''Dig Dug'' and ''[[Mr. Do!]]'' (1982),<ref name="Akagi"/> the reviewers were under the impression that ''Thunderground'' was a "semi-clone" of ''Dig Dug'' and ''Mr. Do!'' Despite this, they gave it positive reviews. Meade gave it an A rating; she said "there ''are'' superficial similarities to ''Dig Dug'' and ''Mr. Do''" but ''Thunderground'' "is a semi-clone with ''muscle''!" She called it "a real challenge" to play, stating "What a game!" Clark gave it a B rating, calling it "a thrilling game" and very "good stuff" but said "the sense of deja-vu detracted from its appeal" while also commenting on its "violence" though he didn't "think anyone will be too bothered."<ref name="VI"/>

French magazine ''[[Tilt (French magazine)|Tilt]]'' reviewed the SG-1000 version of ''Borderline'' in 1984. They gave the game an overall rating of 5 out of 6 stars, while giving 5 stars for the graphics and 4 stars for the sound.<ref name="Tilt">{{cite magazine |title=Borderline |magazine=[[Tilt (French magazine)|Tilt]] |date=May 1984 |issue=12 |pages=35–6 |url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=28&num=288&album=oui}}</ref>

In a retrospective review of the SG-1000 version in 2014, ''Sega Does'' gave it a generally favorable review with a B− rating.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cornelius |first1=Dylan |title=Borderline (SG-1000) |url=https://segadoes.com/2014/04/30/borderline/ |access-date=26 September 2021 |work=Sega Does |date=30 April 2014}}</ref>
