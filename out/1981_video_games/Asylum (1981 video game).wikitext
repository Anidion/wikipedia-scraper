}}'''''Asylum''''' is an [[adventure game]] created by [[William F. Denman Jr.]] and released in 1981 by [[Med Systems]] (later known as Screenplay) of Chapel Hill, North Carolina for the [[TRS-80]] computer. It combines a text adventure with simple line graphics to create a first-person perspective 3D game. Med Systems had earlier released games like ''[[Rat's Revenge]]'', ''[[Deathmaze 5000]]'', and ''[[Labyrinth (1980 video game)|Labyrinth]]'' with the same kind of graphics; these games were among the earliest commercial examples of 3D games.

A sequel named ''Asylum II ''was released in 1982. The sequel was later enhanced with bitmapped graphics, color, and improved descriptions, and released simply as ''Asylum'' for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] in 1983, and [[Commodore 64]] and [[IBM PC]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.trs-80.org/asylum/ | title=Asylum | publisher=TRS-80.org | accessdate=2022-02-04}}</ref>

==Plot==
The story takes place in a [[labyrinth]]ine [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]]. One rather confusing feature of that labyrinth is that some sections of it seem to exist in several places at once. So an item dropped in a certain place will also show up in another place of the labyrinth, in a corridor of the same shape (but different orientation), and vice versa.

==Reception==
Debuting in February 1981, the game sold 5,000 copies by June 1982, appearing on ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s list of top sellers.<ref name="lombardy1982sepoct">{{cite magazine |title=Inside the Industry |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=2&id=6 |format=PDF |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |page=2 | date=September–October 1982 | accessdate= 2016-03-28}}</ref> ''[[BYTE]]'' stated that "Not only is [''Asylum''] a devious game, it is a very good buy for the money".<ref name="byte198112">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-12/1981_12_BYTE_06-12_Computer_Games#page/n37/mode/2up | title=The Coinless Arcade | work=BYTE | date=December 1981 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | pages=38–41}}</ref> ''[[PC Magazine]]'' stated that the game's use of graphics "is one of the features that makes it more exciting than ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]''".
