'''''Bug Attack''''' is a [[fixed shooter]] video game written by Jim Nitchals for the [[Apple II]] and published by [[Cavalier Computer]] in 1981.<ref name="giantlist">{{cite web |last1=Hague |first1=James |title=The Giant List of Classic Game Programmers |url=https://dadgum.com/giantlist/}}</ref> An version for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] was released in 1982.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bug Attack |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-bug-attack_816.html |website=Atari Mania}}</ref> ''Bug Attack'' is based on [[Atari, Inc.]]'s ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'' arcade game.<ref name=eg/>

==Gameplay==
''Bug Attack'' is a game in which the player uses beetles to fight other insects.<ref name="CGW3"/>

==Reception==
Dave Jones reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "the novel touches of ''Bug Attack'', such as the variety of vegetations and patterns of color, and the intermissions which break up the action between insect waves, served to maintain my interest in the game hour after hour. The author of the game is to be complemented on his packing such a successful combination of imaginative flair and technical expertise into the confines of the Apple II."<ref name="CGW3">{{cite magazine |last=McGrath |first=Richard |title=Bug Attack: A Review |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Marchâ€“April 1982 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=34, 38}}</ref>

Reviewing the Apple II original, Leigh Goldstein wrote in ''[[Electronic Games]]'': "Clearly modeled on Atari's coin-op, ''Centipede'', ''Bug Attack'' just doesn't offer enough of the features that make ''Centipede'' such a great game" and "''Bug Attack'' is dull gaming."<ref name=eg/> She cited ''Centipede''{{'}}s sound effects and vertical player movement as two elements lacking from ''Bug Attack''.
