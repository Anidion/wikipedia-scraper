==Gameplay==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Thief (Apple II game).png|thumb|upright=2|Gameplay screenshot]] -->

The game puts the player in control of a [[theft|thief]] that must make his way through simple [[maze]]s, though there are no objects to actually steal. Each level is populated by stocky, possibly [[robot]]ic guards that converge on the player, and which the player must either shoot or evade.
