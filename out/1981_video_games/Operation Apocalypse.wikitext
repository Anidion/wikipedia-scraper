==Reception==
Paul Todd and Russell Sipe reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Operation Apocalypse'' is a two player game. But if you can't find someone with which to play, the computer plays a good game. There are no less than four levels of solitaire play. The computer can even play both sides. The game contains sufficient tactical problems and complexity to give it a realistic feel."<ref name="CGW2">{{cite magazine |last1=Todd |first1=Paul |last2=Sipe |first2=Russell |title=Operation Apocalypse: A Review and Campaign Scenario |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January–February 1982 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=25–26}}</ref>
