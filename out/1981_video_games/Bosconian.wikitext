{{nihongo foot|'''''Bosconian'''''|ボスコニアン|Bosukonian|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a scrolling [[multidirectional shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and released by [[Namco]] in [[Japan]] in 1981. In North America, it was manufactured and distributed by [[Midway Games]]. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying enemy missiles and bases using a ship which shoots simultaneously both the front and back.

''Bosconian'' was commercially successful in Japan and received positive critical reception, but did not achieve the global commercial success of other shoot 'em up games from the [[golden age of arcade video games]]. It was ported to home computers as ''Bosconian '87'' (1987) and spawned two sequels: ''Blast Off'' (1989) and ''[[Final Blaster]]'' (1990). The game has been regarded by critics as influential in the shoot 'em up genre.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Bosconian game screenshot.png|thumb|left|A damaged enemy base (green) and another mid-explosion.]]
The objective of ''Bosconian'' is to score as many points as possible by destroying enemy missiles and bases. The player controls the Starfighter, a ship that can move in eight directions and fires both forward and backward simultaneously.<ref name="vgmag">{{cite magazine|date = August 1982 |title = Beating the Games: How to Play 15 of the Most Popular Videos |magazine = Video Games |url = https://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_01_1982-08_Pumpkin_Press_US_a/page/n43/mode/2up?q=Bosconian |publisher = Pumpkin Press |language=en |page=44 | access-date = November 13, 2020}}</ref> Throughout the game, the Starfighter stays affixed to the center of the screen as it moves.<ref name="Allgame" /> During each round, several green enemy bases — known as "base stars" — appear, all of which must be destroyed in order to advance to the next round. The number of bases increases with each round. Each base has six globe-like cannons arranged in a hexagon around a central core. To destroy a base, the player must either shoot the core or destroy all six cannons, the latter of which gives the player extra points. In later levels, cores begin defending themselves by opening and closing while launching missiles. A [[radar display]] on the right-hand side of the screen shows where enemies are located relative to the player.<ref name="electronicgames">{{cite magazine|date = August 1982 |title = Players Guide to the New Coin-Ops |magazine = [[Electronic Games]] |url = https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_06_1982-08_Reese_Communications_US/page/n59/ |publisher = Reese Publishing Company |language=en |pages=59{{hyphen}}61 |volume=1 |issue=6 |access-date = November 13, 2020}}</ref> The game also features a color-coded alert system with voice commands.<ref name="Allgame" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Bosconian |date=1981 |publisher=Midway Games |type=Arcade flyer |url=https://archive.org/details/arcadeflyer_bosconian/mode/2up |language=en}}</ref>

Additionally, the player must avoid or destroy stationary asteroids, mines, and a variety of enemy missiles and ships which attempt to collide with his or her ship. Enemy bases will also occasionally launch a squadron of ships in formation attacks — destroying the leader causes all remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points.<ref name="electronicgames" /><ref name="vgmag" /> A spy ship will also appear occasionally, which must be destroyed or the game's alert system will turn to red regardless of how long the player has taken.<ref name="maximum">{{cite magazine|date = April 1996 |title = Namco Museum Volume One |magazine = Maximum |url = https://archive.org/details/maximum-the-video-game-magazine-issue-5-april-1996-uk/page/57 |publisher = Sandra McClean |language=en |page=57 |issue=5 |access-date = November 13, 2020}}</ref> Throughout the game, a digitized voice alerts the player to various events, such as incoming enemies or an approaching spy ship.<ref name="Allgame" />

==Plot==
The game takes place after the fictional Rock War, an intergalactic conflict between mankind and aliens which ended with the aliens destroying (nearly) all of Earth's cities with missile-firing [[space station]]s, known as "Orbitals", and enslaving all (surviving) humans. In an attempt to fight back against the aliens and regain their independence, humans built a spacecraft known as the Starfighter with the best technology they could find, but only one such vehicle could be built. The game involves the unnamed pilot of the Starfighter defeating the aliens to save Earth.<ref>{{cite magazine |date = November 1987 |issue = 73 |title = Bosconian Arcade Competition |magazine = [[Computer and Video Games]] |url = https://archive.org/details/ComputerAndVideoGamesIssue073Nov87/page/n51 |issn= 0261-3697 |publisher = [[Future Publishing]] |page=53 |access-date = November 13, 2020}}</ref>

In Japan, ''Bosconian'' was the seventh highest-grossing [[1981 in video games|arcade game of 1981]], according to the annual ''[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]'' chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|title="Donkey Kong" No.1 Of '81 — ''Game Machine's Survey Of "The Year's Best Three AM Machines"'' —|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=182|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 February 1982|page=30|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19820215p.pdf#page=16}}</ref> ''Game Machine'' later listed ''Bosconian'' in their August issue as the 22nd most successful [[table arcade cabinet]] of the month.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Game Machine's Best Hit Games 25 - テーブル型TVゲーム機 (Table Videos)|magazine=Game Machine|issue=218|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|date=15 August 1983|page=27|lang=ja}}</ref> However, the game was less successful internationally. Due to the rising popularity of ''[[Galaga]]'' and a shortage of arcade machines for the game, many of the ''Bosconian'' machines that were not selling were transformed into ''Galaga'' machines.<ref name="BossFight">{{cite book |last1=Kimball |first1=Michael |title=Galaga: Boss Fight Books #4 |date=June 21, 2014 |publisher=Boss Fight Books |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mvuEDwAAQBAJ&q=bosconian+converted+to+galaga&pg=PT92 |accessdate=27 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227215859/https://books.google.com/books?id=mvuEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&lpg=PT92&dq=bosconian+converted+to+galaga&source=bl&ots=R3ItM0gAPf&sig=ACfU3U00rKwJFfm1eULQtQNzbCb5aWkXBg&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjg9Yzc3PLnAhVxJzQIHadkAKI4ChDoATAEegQIChAB%23v%3Donepage&q=bosconian+converted+to+galaga&f=false |archive-date=27 February 2020 |chapter=244|isbn=9781940535036}}</ref>

Upon release, ''Bosconian'' received generally positive reviews. ''Video Games Magazine'' referred to the game as a "treat for ''[[Galaxian]]'' fans" and opining that, while it did not "break ground insofar as graphics, sounds, weaponry, and antagonists are concerned", it had "a terrific eight-way joystick that has great maneuverability".<ref name="vgmag"/> ''[[Electronic Games]]'' called it "a real space-gamer's delight", highly praising its 360-degree movement and the ship's simultaneous front-rear fire, which they noted made it the first game to feature either element, as well as its graphics, gameplay, and other mechanics.<ref name="ElecGames">{{cite news |title=See Space For A Quarter - Bosconian |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_13_1983-03_Reese_Communications_US/page/n54 |accessdate=26 February 2020 |agency=[[Electronic Games]] |issue=13 |publisher=Reese Communications |date=March 1983 |volume=1 |pages=55–56}}</ref>

Mike Roberts and Steve Phipps of ''[[Computer Gamer]]'' reviewed the arcade game several years after its release in 1985, stating it was "good value" and still "enjoyable" to play.<ref name="CG7">{{cite magazine |last1=Roberts |first1=Mike |last2=Phipps |first2=Steve |title=Coin-Op Connection |magazine=[[Computer Gamer]] |date=October 1985 |issue=7 |publisher=[[Argus Press]] |location=United Kingdom |pages=18–9 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gamer_Issue_07_1985-10_Argus_Press_GB/page/n17/mode/2up}}</ref> In a retrospective 1998 review of the game, Brett Alan Weiss of ''[[Allgame]]'' wrote that the game's front-rear firing system, radar display, and alert system "help[ed] make the game a cut above the average shooter of the era".<ref name="Allgame"/>

In another retrospective review in 2018 of the Sharp X68000 version of the game, ''Akiba PC Hotline!'' praised the conversion's accurate portrayal of the arcade original and the "wonderful" rearranged soundtrack.<ref name="Akiba">{{cite web |last1=Sasaki |first1=Jun |title=いつまでも耳に残るサウンドが印象的だった珠玉の1本「ボスコニアン」 |url=https://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/column/retrosoft/1138526.html |website=Akiba PC Hotline! |publisher=Impress Watch |accessdate=27 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818003158/https://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/column/retrosoft/1138526.html |archive-date=18 August 2019 |date=4 September 2018}}</ref> ''Beep!'' criticized the Sord M5 version of the game for its poor quality, low difficulty level, and the lack of features from the arcade original, such as the voice samples.<ref name="Beep">{{cite web |title=No.3 ボスコニアン（m5）ROMカセット |url=https://www.beep-shop.com/column_entry/16964/ |website=Beep! |accessdate=27 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227215117/https://www.beep-shop.com/column_entry/16964/ |archive-date=27 February 2020 |date=1 June 2015}}</ref>
