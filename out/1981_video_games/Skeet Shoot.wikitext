'''''Skeet Shoot''''' is a [[skeet shooting]] [[video game]] for the [[Atari 2600]] and the first game released by [[Games by Apollo]] in December 1981.<ref name=gutmon/> Players assume the role of a skeet shooter shooting [[clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeons]]. There is a two-player mode where the players alternate.

''Skeet Shoot'' was developed by programmer Ed Salvo<ref name="giantlist"/> in his [[Iowa]] home and purchased by Pat Roper under the newly formed Apollo. Despite negative reviews, it was a financial success and led to Salvo's continuation with the company, where he became Director of Development.

==Gameplay==
[[File: Skeet Shoot gameplay.png|thumb|left|The shooter is at the bottom of the screen.]]

The player controls a skeet shooter who is shooting clay pigeons. By pressing the button on the controller, a clay pigeon is sent out and pressing the button again will shoot; moving the joystick changes the gun's angle. A point is earned if the bullet hits. Difficulty varieties adjust the speed of the pigeons.<ref name=Allgame>{{cite web|title=Skeet Shoot|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=8351|website=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=February 18, 2003|access-date=July 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114184850/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=8351|archive-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

Two two-player gameplay variations exist and are activated by modifying the Atari 2600's difficulty switches. There is an alternating version where players take turns shooting the clay pigeons, and another variation features one player shooting while the other controls the angle of the clay pigeons. Other variables that can be changed are the position of the shooter and the direction the bird will enter the screen from.<ref name=Allgame/>

==Development==
Ed Salvo developed ''Skeet Shoot'' independently. Salvo had self-taught himself to program for the Atari 2600 after purchasing an [[Atari 800]]; the dealer wanted a [[flight simulator]] for the 2600 so he contracted Salvo to make one. The game was never released as the dealer had lost interest. According to Salvo, the development of ''Skeet Shoot'' took him around a month at night in his home to finish. After his friend sent him an advertisement from a Dallas newspaper by newly founded studio [[Games by Apollo]] that asked for programmers, he contacted Apollo founder Pat Roper and showed him ''Skeet Shoot''.<ref name=salv>{{cite web|last1=Stilphen|first1=Scott|title=DP Interviews...

When Salvo returned to his Iowa home, Roper contacted him and told him he would buy ''Skeet Shoot'' for five thousand dollars which Salvo accepted.<ref name=salv/>

''Skeet Shoot'' still had [[glitch]]es when it was released; one caused the image to flip vertically. Salvo learned of the glitch and fixed it, and the only cartridges that bear the bug are European versions.<ref name=salv/>

==Reception==
Reviews were negative, as Apollo's publicist Emmit Crawford acknowledged.<ref name=Crawford>{{cite web|title=Apollo, like its namesake, shoots for the video-gaming stars!|url=https://archive.org/stream/Videogaming_Illustrated_1982-08_Ion_International_US#page/n5/mode/2up|website=[[Videogaming Illustrated]]|publisher=Ion International|access-date=June 30, 2014|date=August 1982|pages=7–8|issn=0739-4373}}</ref> Crawford believed that the reason people did not like ''Skeet Shoot'' was because it did not provide enough challenge for most video game players and that the company had distributed it in too much of a hurry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apollo Shoots for the Moon|url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_02_1982-10_Pumpkin_Press_US#page/n15/mode/2up|website=Video Games|publisher=Pumpkin Press|access-date=July 1, 2014|date=October 1982|volume=1|number=2|pages=16, 18}}</ref> He later said that "All in all, Skeet Shoot wasn't a spectacular game to start off with."<ref name=Crawford/> Despite the poor publicity, the game sold very well.<ref name=AGH>{{cite web|title=AGH&nbsp;– Third Party Profile: Apollo|url=http://www.atarihq.com/2678/3party/apollo.html|website=Atari Gaming Headquarters|access-date=June 30, 2014|date=January 23, 2005}}</ref>

Author Brett Alan Weiss wrote that ''Skeet Shoot'' was "a shoddily programmed, graphically primitive game" and said that the poor controls and difficulty levels rendered the game "virtually worthless".<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Brett|title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&pg=PA104|date=March 7, 2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=978-0-7864-8755-4|page=104}}</ref> A writer for ''Atari HQ'' called it a mediocre game.<ref name=AGH/> Lee Peppas of ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' remarked that "Atari & Activision have nothing to fear from the graphics on this first release."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppas|first1=Lee|title=VCS Update|url=https://archive.org/stream/analog-computing-magazine-05/Analog_Computing_05_1982-01_Graphics#page/n39/mode/2up|website=[[ANALOG Computing]]|access-date=July 1, 2014|date=January 1982|number=5|page=37}}</ref> ''[[TV Gamer]]'' opined it was one of the worst games for the system, saying that it was boring and criticizing the fact that it was difficult to hit the skeet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Skeet Shoot|url=https://archive.org/stream/TV_Gamer_1983-06_Boytonbrook_GB#page/n29/mode/2up|website=[[TV Gamer]]|publisher=Boytonbrook|access-date=July 1, 2014|date=June 1983|page=31}}</ref>

Mark Androvich of ''Classic Gamer Magazine'' was similarly negative, writing "Games by Apollo released a couple of decent games before going bankrupt, but you never would have guessed that anyone at the company knew how to program the Atari 2600 judging by their debut game." Androvich opined that while the game was playable, it was not "a step in the right direction" for Apollo.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Androvich|first1=Mark|title=Five Atari 2600 Games Worse Than E.T.|url=https://archive.org/stream/Classic_Gamer_Magazine_Volume_3_Issue_1_2010_Classic_Gamer_US#page/n19/mode/2up|website=[[Classic Gamer]]|access-date=July 7, 2014|year=2010|volume=3|issue=1|page=21}}</ref>

==Legacy==
After ''Skeet Shoot'', Salvo signed a contract that led to the creation of ''[[Spacechase]]''. Eventually, Salvo became Apollo's Director of Development and was given the job of hiring 25 programmers to work on Apollo's games.<ref name=salv/> Apollo went on to release seven other games after ''Skeet Shoot''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Games By Apollo|url=http://www.allgame.com/company.php?id=102&tab=developed|website=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|access-date=July 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116160607/http://www.allgame.com/company.php?id=102&tab=developed|archive-date=November 16, 2014 }}</ref> One year later, the studio eventually filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] on November 12, 1982, due to pressure from its advertising agency, [[Benton & Bowles]]. Apollo owed the company $2.5 million (half of its total debt). Although Roper expected Apollo to return in "smaller form",<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Vid Game Firm Apollo Files Chapter XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WiQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT62|access-date=June 30, 2014|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=December 4, 1982|volume=94|number=48|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> the company closed in 1983 after reorganization attempts failed.<ref name="AGH"/>
