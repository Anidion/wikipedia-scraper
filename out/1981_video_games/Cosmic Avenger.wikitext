{{nihongo foot|'''''Cosmic Avenger'''''|コズミック アベンジャー|''Kozumikku Abenjā''||lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[scrolling shooter]] developed by [[Universal Entertainment|Universal]] and released as an [[arcade video game]] in July 1981.<ref name="ah"/> It is part of the first wave shooters with forced horizontal scrolling which followed [[Konami]]'s ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' and ''[[Super Cobra]]'' from earlier in the year. It was released the same month as ''[[Vanguard (video game)|Vanguard]]''. The final installment in Universal's ''Cosmic'' series,<ref name="ah"/> players take control of the Avenger space fighter and, as in ''Scramble'', use bullets and bombs against enemy air and ground forces. The world is one continuous level made up of different areas.

The game was ported to [[ColecoVision]] as one of its August 1982 [[launch title]]s in North America. The ColecoVision version was more successful than the arcade original, garnering mostly positive reception from critics who praised the action, visuals, and sound effects. Ports to the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]] were in development and advertised, but not released.

[[File:ARC Cosmic Avenger.png|left|thumb|The player's ship (left of the searchlight beam) flies over the plaid terrain of the first section.]]

Players take control of the Avenger fighter craft, guiding it across  horizontally scrolling terrain and dodging obstacles. The main objective is earning points by destroying alien forces.<ref name="CVGARCca">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-001#page/n27/mode/1up|title=Arcade Action - Sea-Space Mission|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=1|publisher=[[EMAP]]|date=November 1981|page=28}}</ref><ref name="CACVmanual">''Cosmic Avenger'' cartridge instructions (ColecoVision, US)</ref> The game is divided into three sections, each with its own terrain and obstacles. There is no intermission between sections; the game scrolls into the new terrain seamlessly. The game can be played by one or two players, alternating turns as each player's ship is destroyed.<ref name="CACVmanual"/>

A joystick moves the ship in four directions, and buttons fire lasers and bombs to destroy spaceships, anti-aircraft missiles, tanks, and UFOs. A radar display at the top of the screen shows incoming enemies. The ship does not require a constantly depleting fuel supply to be replenished, which allows players to focus solely on the enemies. The enemies have specific behavior patterns and can crash into each other. As the game progresses, enemies act more aggressively and fire at a faster rate. An "X station" occasionally appears on the ground; if hit, it destroys all enemies visible on the screen.

If the player's ship is hit by enemy fire, crashes against the terrain, enemies or any explosion radius, a life is lost and they will be [[respawn]]ed into the nearest [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] reached. Once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]], although players can insert coins to continue playing without having to restart from the beginning.

==Reception==
The ColecoVision version of ''Cosmic Avenger'' was reviewed in ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine in its "Arcade Alley" column where it was described as "great fun" and as a game that "packs more than enough excitement in its three screens to satisfy any lover of arcade-style action games". Although reviewers noted that the game is "not as free-ranging as [those] in which the ship can scroll left as well as right", it was praised for its "beautiful graphics", and it was suggested that ''Cosmic Avenger'' might herald the coming of a "scrolling shootout" trend in home video games.<ref name="AACVca">{{cite magazine|last1=Kunkel|first1= Bill|author-link1=Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2=Katz|first2=Arnie|author-link2=Arnie Katz|title=Arcade Alley: ColecoVision–The New State of the Art|magazine=[[Video (magazine)|Video]]|volume=6|issue=9|publisher=Reese Communications|date=December 1982|pages=26, 112|issn=0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|26}} In September 1982, ''Arcade Express'' reviewed the ColecoVision version and scored it 9 out of 10.<ref name="AECVca"/> ''[[Creative Computing|Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games]]'' said in 1983 that "although ''Cosmic Avenger'' was not terribly popular in the arcades, Coleco's adaptation will do well in the home market" and a "nice addition" to the console's library.<ref name="CCV&AGCVca">{{cite magazine|last=Linzmayer|first=Owen|url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Arcade_Games_Vol_1_No_1_1983-09_Creative_Computing_US#page/n51/mode/2up|title=Home Video Games: Colecovision: Alive With Five|magazine=Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games|volume=1|issue=1|publisher=Ahl Computing|date=Spring 1983|page=50}}</ref>
