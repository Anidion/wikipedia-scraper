'''''Taxman''''' is a clone of [[Namco]]'s ''[[Pac-Man]]'' written by Brian Fitzgerald for the [[Apple II]] and published by H.A.L. Labs, a firm he cofounded with [[Greg Autry]], in 1981.<ref name=giantlist/>

Featuring the same maze and yellow Pac-Man character as the arcade game, and promoted as "the definitive version of the popular game," HAL was asked to stop selling ''Taxman'' by [[Atari, Inc.]] who owned the home rights to ''Pac-Man''. Atari published a modified version of ''Taxman'' as the official Apple II port of ''Pac-Man'' under its [[Atarisoft]] label.<ref name="fossils">{{cite web |title=Taxman |url=http://www.thelogbook.com/phosphor/1981/taxman-apple/ |website=Phosphor Dot Fossils |access-date=2018-08-25 |archive-date=2018-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826043905/http://www.thelogbook.com/phosphor/1981/taxman-apple/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> HAL Labs then changed the mazes and some of the graphics of ''Taxman'' and rebranded it as ''Taxman 2'' in 1982.

Fitzgerald publicly released the ''Taxman'' source code in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |title=Source Code to TAXMAN to be Released |url=https://www.callapple.org/vintage-apple-computers/apple-ii/source-code-to-be-taxman-released/ |website=Call A.P.P.L.E. |date=August 7, 2015}}</ref>

''Taxman'' is set in the land of [[No such thing as a free lunch|Tanstaafl]] in which the rebellious citizens are rioting in the streets, and the player passes through tax centers located in each precinct to temporarily pacify the rebels.<ref name="SG"/>

==Reception==
Karl Westerholm reviewed ''Taxman'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 56.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Westerholm |first=Karl |date=October 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=56|pages=36}}</ref> Westerholm commented that "I definitely recommend this game to all who waste too many quarters at arcades, as it is just as addictive as the original."<ref name="SG"/>
