''Qix'' is one of a handful of games made by [[Taito]]'s American division (another is ''[[Zoo Keeper (1982 video game)|Zoo Keeper]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|title=MobyGames: Game Browser: Games Developed By: Taito America Corporation|url=https://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/taito-america-corporation/developed-by/|access-date=2020-09-09|website=MobyGames|archive-date=2021-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211031043840/https://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/taito-america-corporation/developed-by/|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the ''Qix'', an abstract stick-like entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle. The objective is to draw lines that close off parts of the rectangle to fill in a set amount of the playfield.

''Qix'' was ported to the contemporary [[Atari 5200]] (1982), [[Atari 8-bit computers]] (1983),<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ti8EAAAAMBAJ&dq=qix+Taito+America+Corporation&pg=PA23 I Break for Arcadians: Good news, bad news - new games, joystick reviewed: Qix], By Joaquin Boaz, InfoWorld, 8 Aug 1983, Page 23</ref> and [[Commodore 64]] (1983), then was brought to a wide variety of systems in the late 1980s and early 1990s: [[MS-DOS]] (1989), [[Amiga]] (1989), another version for the C64 (1989), [[Apple IIGS]] (1990), [[Game Boy]] (1990), [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (1991), and [[Atari Lynx]] (1991).

Multiple home and arcade sequels followed and the concept was widely cloned. In the ''Gals Panic'' series from [[Kaneko]], each captured area is not filled with a color, but reveals part of an image of a woman.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Qixingame.png|thumb|left|57% of the screen captured, mostly with Fast Draw (blue). The Qix is just below the center, and the player's marker above and to the left. One Sparx is directly below the marker, another above on the right side of the map.]]

Controls consist of a four-direction [[joystick]] and two buttons: "Slow Draw" and "Fast Draw".

The player controls a diamond-shaped marker that initially moves along the edges of the playfield. Holding down one of the draw buttons allows the marker to draw a line (''Stix'') in unclaimed territory in an attempt to create a closed shape. Once an area is captured, it is filled with color and points are awarded based on the area claimed and drawing speed. Areas captured entirely with Slow Draw (orange-red in the screenshot) are worth double. The titular ''Qix'' is a colorful geometric figure in constant and random motion. The Qix will not actively seek out the marker, and it will not harm the marker if it collides with it while the marker is traversing the edge of the playfield or of any captured area. However, if the Qix collides with the marker as it is drawing a Stix before a new area is captured (or it touches the exposed Stix), one life is lost.

The marker cannot cross or backtrack along the line being drawn. If the marker stops while drawing, a fuse appears and burns along the line toward the marker; if it reaches the marker, the player loses one life. The fuse disappears once the marker is moved. If the player draws into a position where it cannot proceed any further, the fuse is triggered. The [[attract mode]] calls this a "Spiral Death Trap".

''Sparx'' are enemies that traverse all playfield edges except unfinished Stix. A life is lost if one hits the marker. A meter at the top of the screen counts down to the release of additional Sparx and the mutation of all Sparx into Super Sparx, which can chase the marker along uncompleted Stix.

To complete a level, the player must claim a 75% percentage of the playfield (adjustable to be between 50% and 90%). If a level is completed by exceeding the minimum area percentage, a bonus is awarded for every 1% beyond the threshold.

Starting in level three, the player faces two Qixes. Splitting the playfield into two regions, each containing one Qix, ends the level. No immediate bonus is awarded for this, but a bonus multiplier is applied to the scoring in all subsequent levels. This multiplier starts at one before the first time that the Qix are split and increases by one for every additional splitting of the Qix, to a maximum of nine. Levels also add additional Sparx and the eventual appearance of only Super Sparx.

Upon release, ''Qix'' was a commercial hit. In 1983, ''[[Electronic Games]]'' reported that the game exceeded Taito's expectations, quickly rising to being one of the most popular titles of the year. The magazine attributes the game's success to it being unlike any other game at the time, specifically for its unique premise and gameplay mechanics. A year after its debut, its popularity declined and the game became largely forgotten. Keith Egging, Taito's "Director of Creativity",<ref>{{cite web |website=Giant List of Classic Game Programmers |title=The Story of Zoo Keeper |first= John |last= Morgan |date=1 January 2001 |url=https://dadgum.com/giantlist/archive/zookeeper.html}}</ref> told ''Electronic Games'': "''Qix'' was conceptually too mystifying for gamers. [...] It was impossible to master and once the novelty wore off, the game faded".<ref name="pearl198306">{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_16_1983-06_Reese_Communications_US/page/n81 |title=Closet Classics |work=Electronic Games |date=June 1983 |access-date=2015-01-06 |author=Pearl, Rick |pages=82}}</ref> In Japan, it was the fifth highest-grossing [[1981 in video games|arcade game of 1981]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title="Donkey Kong" No.1 Of '81 — ''Game Machine's Survey Of "The Year's Best Three AM Machines"'' —|magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=182|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=15 February 1982|page=30|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19820215p.pdf#page=16}}</ref> The game has since been dubbed a [[sleeper hit]].<ref name="Video"/>

''Qix'' and its home conversions have received largely positive reviews. The game was praised for its original concept and ideas, and has been described as a [[cult video game|cultural phenomenon]].<ref name="Video">{{cite journal |last1=Kunkel |first1=Bill |author-link1=Bill Kunkel (journalist) |last2=Katz |first2=Arnie |date=November 1983 |title=Arcade Alley: Wintertime Winners |journal=Video |publisher=Reese Communications |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=38–39 |issn=0147-8907}}</ref> ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'', who reviewed the [[Atari 5200]] release, applauded its gameplay and bizarre yet interesting premise.

Retrospective coverage of ''Qix'' has also been positive. ''[[AllGame]]''{{'}}s Brett Alan Weiss commended ''Qix'' for its addictive gameplay, technological accomplishments, and responsive controls. While he believed the graphics and sound effects were overly simplistic and crude, he said the game as a whole is "abstract minimalism at its videogame best".<ref name="Allgame"/> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' staff enjoyed ''Qix'' particularly for its addictive nature. They also compared its concept to that of the Etch A Sketch, a toy that allowed its user to draw straight lines across a small screen. The staff believed the game's simplicity was also one of its strong points, alongside its sound effects for being satisfying to hear.<ref name="RGamer">{{cite web |author1=Retro Gamer Staff |title=Qix |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/qix-2/ |website=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |access-date=3 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603171828/https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/wonder-boy/ |archive-date=3 June 2020 |date=2 July 2009}}</ref>
