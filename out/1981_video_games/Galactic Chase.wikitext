==Gameplay==
''Galactic Chase'' is a game in which invaders attack earth, and formations can break off to attack directly.<ref name="CGW2"/>

==Reception==
[[John J. Anderson]] reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that: {{blockquote|The real moments in this game come when you are attacked by formations on all sides–four, six, or more aliens bent on bombing or ramming you out of existence. The novice will not survive an assault like this. However, with much practice, you can learn to "spear" the enemy, vaporizing them on the nosecone of your ship. This calls for nimble steering, needless to say, and all the while you must fire at your other attackers."<ref name="CGW2">{{cite magazine |last=Anderson |first=John |title=Atari Arcade |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January–February 1982 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=22}}</ref>}}
