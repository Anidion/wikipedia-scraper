==Reception==
David Hunter reviewed the game for ''[[Softalk]]'' and said that while the winner is determined by their score, "a low score does not necessarily indicate a badly played game" because he found it "easy to rack up points bombing cities and farms" while destroying "more crucial things like the runway and factory are what help you win the game."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hunter |first=David |date=March 1982 |title=Reviews |url=https://archive.org/details/softalkv2n07mar1982/page/103/ |magazine=[[Softalk]] |via=[[Internet Archive]] |volume=2 |page=103 |accessdate=2024-05-14 }}</ref>

Luther Shaw reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that a "pure arcadist" may not enjoy ''Bez-MX'' but players who enjoy strategy games "with a little arcade flavor" may find the game "worth considering" based on its price.<ref name="CGW5">{{cite magazine |last=Shaw |first=Luther |title=Micro - Reviews |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_2.4/cgw_2.4/page/n35/ |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |via=[[Internet Archive]] |date=July–August 1982 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=34–35}}</ref>
