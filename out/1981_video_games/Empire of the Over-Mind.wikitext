==Contents==
''Empire of the Over-Mind'' is a text only adventure game in which the player must free a magical kingdom from the control of the evil computer Over-Mind.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal |last=Seligman |first=Bill |date=March 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews |journal=[[The Space Gamer]] |publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]] |issue=49 |pages=34}}</ref> The game is accompanied by a poem, "The Rhyme of the Over-Mind," which provides necessary clues for the gameplay.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Hughes |first=Anthony |date=1984 |title=Empire of the Overmind |url=https://www.page6.org/archive/issue_10/page_38a.htm |journal=[[Page 6]] |issue=10}}</ref>

==Reception==
In a 1984 ''[[Compute!|COMPUTE!]]'' piece on adventure games, Selby Bateman wrote: "One very popular game for Avalon Hill has been its all-text adventure, ''Empire of  the OverMind'' [sic] for Apple II and Atari computers, which is still selling well, notes Jack Dodd, Avalon Hill's director of marketing."<ref name=bateman/>

The price of the game was a point of contention. Anthony Hughes wrote for ''[[Page 6]]'' that it was "twice the price of the U.K. produced Adventures but still represents very good value."<ref name=":0" /> Bill Seligman's review in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 49 concluded that "For the price of this primitive program, one could buy two-and-a-half Scott Adams all-text adventures or one full-color graphics adventure from On-Line. Not recommended."<ref name="SG"/>

Another criticism of the game was its lengthy load and processing times.<ref name=":0" />
