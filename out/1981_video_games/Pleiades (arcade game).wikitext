{{nihongo|'''''Pleiades'''''|プレアデス}} is a [[fixed shooter]] arcade game released in 1981 by [[Tehkan]] (now Tecmo) and licensed to [[Centuri]].<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9045|name=Pleiades}}</ref> The name is shown on the title screen as '''''Pleiads'''''.<ref name=ah/> The title comes from the mythical Greek [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]], the seven daughters of the [[Titan (mythology)|titan]] [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]].

== Gameplay ==
Pleiades is a multi-stage space [[shoot 'em up]] in which enemy ships fly at the player in waves in a similar fashion to games like ''[[Galaxian]]'' and ''[[Phoenix (1980 video game)|Phoenix]]''. Ships emerge from a mothership at the top of the screen and swoop downwards in a series of patterns which players must anticipate as they shoot the ships and avoid being obliterated by the Martian onslaught. There are four stages in the game. In the first stage the Earth space ship must defend the space station from Martian invaders who have the ability to transform from flying invaders, to walking invaders who build walls across the Earth city; these barriers must be destroyed. At the end of stage one the Earth space ship flies to the top of the screen to prepare to meet stage two. In the second stage the player encounters eight space monsters who must be hit directly on center to be destroyed before moving onto stage three. In this stage invaders emerge from a space ship at the top of the screen and swoop down on the player in sweeping attacks.  In the final wave the player has to navigate through parked spaceships to dock on a landing pad as the screen [[Vertically scrolling video game|scrolls]] downwards. Extra points can be gained in this stage by collecting flags as the player moves towards the landing corridor.

== Legacy ==

''Pleiades '' is included in the ''Tecmo Hit Parade'' collection for the [[PlayStation 2]] which includes seven classic arcade games from the publisher's past, as well as the eleven game compilation ''Tecmo Classic Arcade'' for the [[Xbox]].

''Pleiades'' appeared in the 1983 horror film ''[[Nightmares_(1983_film)|Nightmares]], ''in the vignette "Bishop of Battle." ''Pleiads'' also made a cameo appearance in the 1984 Coen Brothers film ''[[Blood Simple]]''.

== Records ==
Richie Knucklez holds the official [[Guinness World Record]] for this game with 279,090 points recorded on June 4, 2011, at the Annual Classic Video Game and Pinball Tournament at [[Funspot]] in [[Weirs Beach, New Hampshire]].
