'''''Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord''''' is the first game in the ''[[Wizardry]]'' series of [[role-playing video game]]s. It was developed by [[Andrew C. Greenberg]] and [[Robert Woodhead]].  In 1980, Norman Sirotek formed [[Sir-Tech|Sir-Tech Software, Inc.]] and launched a beta version of the product at the 1980 Boston Computer Convention.  The final version of the game was released in 1981.<ref name=hallford>{{cite book

A 3D remake of the game was released by Digital Eclipse on 15 September 2023 onto PC via [[Steam (service)|Steam]] platform. [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2518960/Wizardry_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord/]

The game was one of the first [[Dungeons & Dragons]]-style role-playing games to be written for computer play, and the first such game to offer color graphics.<ref name="1upD&D">{{cite web | last=Crigger | first=Lara | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3168091 | title=Chasing D&D: A History of RPGs | access-date=2008-06-05 | publisher=[[1up.com]] }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It was also the first true party-based role-playing video game.<ref name=hallford/> It is now listed among the [[List of video games considered the best|best video games]] of all time.

The game ended up as the first of a trilogy that also included ''[[Wizardry II: The Knight of Diamonds]]'' and ''[[Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn]]''.<ref>{{cite book

==Gameplay==
Starting in the town, which is represented only as a text-based menu, the player creates a party of up to six characters from an assortment of five possible races (Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Hobbits), three alignments (Good, Neutral, Evil), and four basic classes (Fighter, Priest, Mage, Thief),<ref name=hallford/> with four elite classes{{r|maher20120323}} (Bishop: priest and mage spells; Samurai: fighter with mage spells; Lord: fighter with priest spells, and Ninja: fighter with thief abilities) unlocked once the characters have progressed sufficiently.  Good and evil characters normally cannot be assigned to the same party.

After characters are equipped with basic armor and weaponry, the party descends into the dungeon below Trebor's castle. This consists of a maze of ten levels,<ref name="ps225">{{cite magazine

 | date=July 1984 }}</ref> each progressively more challenging than the last. Classes have multiple spells, each with seven levels, that characters learn as they advance.{{r|maher20120323}}

The style of play employed in this game has come to be termed a [[dungeon crawl]]. The goal, as in most subsequent role-playing video games, is to find treasure including ever more potent items, gain levels of experience by killing monsters, then face the evil arch-[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|wizard]] Werdna on the bottom level and retrieve a powerful amulet. The goal of most levels is to find the elevator or stairs going down to the next level without being killed in the process.

The graphics of the original game are extremely simple by today's standards; most of the screen is occupied by text, with about 10% devoted to a first-person view of the dungeon maze using line graphics. By the standards of the day, however, the graphics improved on the text-only games that had been far more common. When monsters are encountered, the dungeon maze disappears, replaced by a picture of one of the monsters. Combat is against from 1 to 4 groups of monsters. The game's lack of an [[automap]] feature, which had not been invented at the time of its release, practically forces the player to draw the map for each level on graph paper (included in the box) as they walk through the 20x20 dungeon maze,<ref name="CGW"/>{{r|maher20120323}} step by step – failing to do this often results in becoming permanently lost, as there are many locations in the maze that have a permanent "Darkness" spell upon the square (making the player walk blindly) or a "Teleport" spell sending the player to a new location. A magic spell can be used to determine the current location of the party, and at higher levels there is a teleport spell that can be used to quickly transition between the maze levels. Care is necessary when teleporting as the player must enter both the level and coordinates to teleport to (the number of steps north, south, east, or west from his current location) and it is easily possible to land in a trap or solid stone, ending the game. The original releases of Wizardry also do not announce that the player has teleported and play resumes as if one step forward was taken.<ref name="CGW"/>

The game has unforgiving difficulty as players cannot save their progress within the dungeon; they must exit the dungeon first. In the event of a total party kill, play cannot be resumed; however, a new party may recover the bodies and items of dead adventurers.  Later Wizardry games made it easier by restarting at the point in the dungeon where the characters died. It can take hundreds of hours to finish the game.<ref name="ps225"/>

Wizardry saves the player's party and game progress onto a scenario disk. After booting, a new one may be created with a blank floppy disk or an existing one used. Completion of ''Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord'' is necessary to play the sequels Wizardry II and III since they require the characters from the first game to be imported from a scenario disk.

==Development==
[[Andrew C. Greenberg|Andrew Greenberg]], then a [[Cornell University]] student, began the project's development in 1978, and the game was in an early playable state by fall 1979, when it became popular among fellow students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/wizardry/wizardry.htm |title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Wizardry |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606103533/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/wizardry/wizardry.htm |archive-date=6 June 2017|website=Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref> ''Wizardry'' drew influences from earlier games from the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] system, most notably the 1977 role-playing game ''Oubliette''.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/wizardry/wizardry-interview.htm |title=Hardcore Gaming 101 interview with Robert Woodhead|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611185603/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/wizardry/wizardry-interview.htm |archive-date=11 June 2017}}</ref>{{r|maher20120326}} It was initially coded in [[Applesoft BASIC]], but Greenberg and Woodhead rewrote it in [[UCSD Pascal]] after BASIC proved too slow to be playable. They had to wait for a [[run-time system]], not available until early 1981, before publishing it. The game took two and a half man-years to complete, but the delay benefited ''Wizardry'' by permitting almost one year of [[playtest]]ing and [[game balance|game balancing]] before release, distinguishing it from others such as ''[[Ultima I]]''. Frederick Sirotek, Norman's businessman father and the company's financier, insisted that the packaging and documentation be professional, also distinguishing the game from others sold in [[Ziploc]] bags.<ref name="CGW">{{cite magazine

The Commodore 64/128 versions of ''Wizardry'' 1-3 share a common code base with the Apple originals, as they all use the same run-time 6502 Pascal interpreter which provides support for overlays and low-level functions to interface with the hardware. USCD Pascal was also used for the IBM versions, but with an x86 version of the interpreter.

Lengthy load time and extensive disk access was a problem with ''Wizardry''; however, the Commodore versions, which particularly suffer from this, provided a variety of workarounds. In C128 mode, the VDC memory is used to store overlays and REUs are supported in both C64 and C128 mode. Wizardry 2-5 also detect if 16k or 64k of VDC memory is present and can use the 1571 drive's burst mode for faster load time.

"Werdna" and "Trebor" are Greenberg and Woodhead's first names spelled backwards. Their names also appear as initials (i.e., ACG and RJW) on the map of the eighth and ninth floors.{{r|maher20120323}}

Sir-Tech published ''Wizardry'', Revision 2 in 1982, which included new features. John M. Morrison for ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 50 commented that "By this time, your old disk should be wearing out. I definitely recommend sending the $5 in to transfer backup characters, as you'll get Revision 2 to boot."<ref name="SG50">{{cite magazine|last=Morrison |first=John M. |date=April 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews|magazine=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=50|pages=35}}</ref>
