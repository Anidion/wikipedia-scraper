'''''K-Razy Shoot-Out''''' is a clone of the arcade video game ''[[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]'' developed by K-Byte, a division of Kay Enterprises, and released for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] in 1981.<ref name=eg/> The game was written by Torre Meeder and Keith Dreyer,<ref name="atarimania">{{cite web|title=K-Razy Shoot-Out|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-k-razy-shoot-out_6759.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref> and was the first Atari 8-bit cartridge from a [[third-party developer]].{{r|ccvag1983spring}} An [[Atari 5200]] version followed in 1983. 
The team of Dreyer and Meeder also wrote the 1983 Atari 8-bit game ''[[Boulders and Bombs]]''.<ref name=giantlist/>

''K-Razy Shoot-Out'' is part of a series of titles with the "K-" prefix, including ''K-Razy Kritters''<ref>{{cite web|title=K-Razy Kritters|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-k-razy-kritters_s2844.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref> and ''K-Star Patrol''.<ref>{{cite web|title=K-Star Patrol Manual|url=https://archive.org/details/agm_K-Star_Patrol|website=archive.org}}</ref> All of them were published on cartridge. After CBS Software purchased K-Byte,<ref name=ahl/> the games were published under the CBS brand, including the Atari 5200 port of ''K-Razy Shoot-Out''.<ref name="ahq">{{cite web|last1=Iida|first1=Keita|title=Atari 5200 Review: K-RAZY SHOOT-OUT|url=http://www.atarihq.com/reviews/5200/k-razy_shoot-out.html|website=AtariHQ.com}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
As in ''Berzerk'', the goal is to destroy all of the [[robot]]s occupying a series of randomly generated [[maze]]s. In ''Berzerk'', if the player takes too long to clear a maze, an indestructible bouncing [[ball]] ("Evil Otto") drives the player to an exit. ''K-Razy Shoot-Out'' uses a visible timer instead.<ref name="ap">{{cite web |title=K-Razy Shoot-Out |url=https://www.atariprotos.com/5200/software/shootout/shootout.htm |website=Atari Protos}}</ref> If the timer runs out, the game ends. If the player exits a maze without clearing it, the player has to replay one or two mazes without getting points.<ref name="manual">{{cite book |title=K-Razy Shoot-Out |date=1981 |publisher=CBS Software |url=https://archive.org/details/KRazyShootOutCBS/page/n0}}</ref>
