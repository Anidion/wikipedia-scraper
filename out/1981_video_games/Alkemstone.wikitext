'''''Alkemstone''''' is a [[puzzle video game]] published by Level-10 (a division of Dakin 5) for the [[Apple II]] in 1981. It is a puzzle in a dungeon which the character explores to determine the location of the Alkemstone.<ref name="SG"/>

==Prize==
The Alkemstone was hidden in the real world and the publisher offered a $5000 reward for the first person to decipher its location. It was likely inspired by the popularity of the ''[[Masquerade_(book)|Masquerade]]'' [[armchair treasure hunt]] published in 1979 and still unsolved at the time of Alkemstone's release.

The reward was increased to $7500 in 1982.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/CreativeComputing1982-09/page/n11/mode/2up | title=Creative Computing Magazine 1982-09 | date=September 1982 }}</ref> The prize was never awarded and it is unknown if anyone solved the clues or recovered the Alkemstone from the location it was hidden.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hubbard |first1=Reed |title=Alkemstone |url=https://www.mocagh.org/loadpage.php?getgame=alkemstone |website=Museum of Computer Adventure Game History |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The dungeon size is 32 rooms wide x 16 rooms deep, however some clues appear intermittently and therefore rooms must be carefully inspected over many visits.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dyer |first1=Jason |title=Alkemstone |url=https://bluerenga.blog/tag/alkemstone/?order=ASC |website=All the Adventures Project |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>
