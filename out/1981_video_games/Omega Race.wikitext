'''''Omega Race''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade video game]] designed by Ron Haliburton and released in 1981 by [[Midway Games|Midway]].<ref name=giantlist/> It is the only arcade game with [[vector graphics]] that Midway created.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

''Omega Race'' was ported to the [[VIC-20]] and [[Commodore 64]] and published by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] in 1982. In 1983, [[ColecoVision]] and [[Atari 2600]] versions were released by [[CBS Electronics]].

==Gameplay==
Set in the year 2003, the player controls an Omegan Fighter [[spacecraft|spaceship]] to destroy enemy droid ships in a rectangular "track."<ref name="ah">{{cite web |title=Omega Race |url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=omega-race-upright-model-model-929&page=detail&id=1880 |website=Arcade History |access-date=2018-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143531/https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=omega-race-upright-model-model-929&page=detail&id=1880 |archive-date=2018-06-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> The player's ship is controlled with a spinner to rotate the ship, a button for thrusting, and a button for firing lasers. The enemies that the player must destroy or avoid are drone ships, commander ships, two types of space mines, and shooting star ships. The ship bounces off an invisible barrier on the edges of the screen that briefly appears when hit. By default, [[Life (video games)#Extra lives|extra ships]] are awarded at 40,000 and 100,000 points.

==Ports==
The Atari 2600 cartridge came bundled with a "booster grip" controller which converted the single-button [[Atari CX40 joystick]] to having separate buttons for thrust and shoot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Omega Race by CBS Electronics|url=http://www.atariguide.com/2/204.htm|website=Atari Guide|access-date=2015-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223052355/http://www.atariguide.com/2/204.htm|archive-date=2015-12-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Omega Race'' is one of a few  CBS games for the Atari 2600 with an additional 256 bytes of RAM in each cartridge, a feature promoted by CBS as "RAM Plus."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stilphen |first1=Scott |title=Part of the Secret to the VCS's Longevity |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/articles/longevity/longevity.html |website=Atari Compendium}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Consumer Guide''{{'}}s ''How To Win At Video Games'' stated in 1982 of ''Omega Race'' that "any unskilled player can pop a quarter into the machine and stay up there for up to 20,000 points."  According to the book, more than 35,000 machines were created, with the average machine taking in $181.00 per week at the time of the book's publication. Frequently, it was one of the top ten money-making arcade machines in any given week in that time period.<ref name="howtowin">{{Cite book |title=How to Win Video Games |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1982 |isbn=0-671-45841-8 |pages=42, 86 |chapter=Omega Race |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/book_how_to_win_video_games#page/n41/mode/2up/search/%22consumer+guide%22+%22omega+race%22}}</ref> Michael Blanchet's 1982 book ''How to Beat the Video Games'' praised it as having a "deceiving appearance", saying that despite appearing easy it "develops a healthy level of frustration, which you'll find quite stimulating".<ref name="howtobeat">{{cite book
