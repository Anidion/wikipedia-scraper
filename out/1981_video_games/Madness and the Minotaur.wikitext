==Gameplay==
The goal of the game is to retrieve a number of treasures. In the course of doing this, the player will encounter other objects that may or may not be useful. Often, the player needs one object to act as a "key" for another.  There is no rhyme or reason to this. The player doesn't ''use'' the key object to obtain the other; he just needs to be carrying it.  For example, the player may see a shield. Perhaps the player needs to be carrying the dagger to get the shield.  If the player has the dagger, the shield is reachable; if he does not, it is not. With the exception of a randomly appearing "oracle", the game gives no indication of what objects are needed to reach a treasure. There are various magic spells that can be learned throughout the game that have various effects.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://computerarcheology.com/CoCo/MadnessMinotaur/ | title = Madness and the Minotaur | website = Computer Archeology | last = Cantrell | first = Chris | access-date = February 6, 2017 | quote = "To win the game you have to learn all 8 spells and drop all 16 treasure objects in the forest (room 202). The spells are sprinkled around the rooms at random. Some objects are "protected" and require you have a set of other objects to release (see below)."}}</ref>
