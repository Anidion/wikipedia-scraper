'''''Gobbler''''' is a 1981 clone of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' for the [[Apple II]], published by [[On-Line Systems]] (later to become [[Sierra Entertainment]]). It was programmed by Olaf Lubeck who also wrote ''[[Cannonball Blitz]]'' (1982) for the Apple II, a clone of ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref name=giantlist/>

==Gameplay==
The player uses the arrow keys to move the character left and right, and the A and Z keys to move up or down.  Each dot is worth five points, while pieces of fruit (cherries, an apple and a lime) are each worth 200.  Consuming the white pellets makes the four ghosts vulnerable for a short time, during which they are colored green and can be eaten (earning 200 points for the first, 400 for the second, etc.).
