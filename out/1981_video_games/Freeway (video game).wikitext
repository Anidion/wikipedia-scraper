'''''Freeway''''' is an [[action video game]] written by [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]] for the [[Atari 2600]] and published by [[Activision]] in 1981.

One or two players control [[chicken]]s who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to "[[Why did the chicken cross the road?|get to the other side]]". Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a motorist, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to. The winner is the player who has scored the most points in the time allotted.

==Development==
David Crane got the idea from the SCES in Chicago, where a man tried to cross the street.

==Patch==
If a player scored 20 or more points on either Road 3 or Road 7 and mailed a photograph of the television screen, Activision would send the player a cloth "Save The Chicken Foundation" patch with the Activision logo and the stylized "running chicken" image from the game package.

==Reception==
