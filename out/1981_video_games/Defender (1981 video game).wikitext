'''''Defender''''' is a horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] developed by [[WMS Industries|Williams Electronics]] in 1980 and released as an [[arcade video game]] in 1981. The game is set on either an unnamed planet or city (depending on platform) where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by [[Eugene Jarvis]], a pinball programmer at Williams; ''Defender'' was Jarvis's first video game project and drew inspiration from ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''. ''Defender'' was demonstrated in late 1980, before entering production in early 1981. It was distributed in Japan by [[Taito]].

''Defender'' was one of the most important titles of the [[golden age of arcade video games]], selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best-selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the [[video game industry]] and one of the most difficult video games. Though not the first game to scroll horizontally, it created the genre of purely horizontal scrolling [[shoot 'em up]]s. It inspired the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations.

Ports were developed for contemporary game systems, most of them by either [[Atari, Inc.]] or its software label for non-Atari platforms, [[Atarisoft]]. The 1982 [[Atari 2600]] version was one of the [[List of best-selling Atari 2600 video games|best-selling games]] for the system, with over 3 million cartridges sold.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Defender Gameplay Screen.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A horizontal rectangular video game screenshot that is a digital representation of a planet surface. A white, triangular spaceship in the upper right corner battles green alien enemies. The top of the screen features a banner that displays icons, numbers, and a miniature version of the landscape.|The spaceship (upper right) flies above the surface to protect humans. The minimap shows the entire world.]]

''Defender'' is a side-view, horizontally [[scrolling shooter]] set on the surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a spaceship flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The player starts with three "smart bombs", which destroy all visible enemies. As a last resort, the "hyperspace" button works as in ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'': the player's ship reappears in a random—possibly unsafe—location. Players are allotted three ships at the start of the game; another ship and smart bomb are awarded every 10,000 points (adjustable per machine). Two players can alternate turns.

The object is to destroy all alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Landers pick up humans and attempt to carry them to the top of the screen at which point they turn into fast-moving mutants. A captured human can be freed by shooting the lander, then catching the human before it falls to its death, and dropping it off on the ground.

Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy or its projectiles, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.<ref name="Ultimate">{{cite book| title = [[The Ultimate History of Video Games]]| last = Kent| first = Steven|authorlink=Steven L.

== Development ==

''Defender'' was Williams Electronics' first attempt at developing a new video game; the company's earlier game was a ''[[Pong]]'' clone.<ref name="Ultimate"/> The popularity of coin-operated arcade games in 1979 spurred the company to shift its focus from pinball games to arcade games.<ref name="Halcyon">{{cite book| title = Halcyon Days: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Games Programmers| editor = James Hague| year = 1997| chapter = Eugene Jarvis| publisher = Dadgum Games| chapter-url = https://dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/JARVIS.HTM| access-date = 2009-12-06| title-link = Halcyon Days (book)}}</ref> The company chose Eugene Jarvis, who had a successful record of Williams pinball games, to head development.<ref name="Ultimate"/> [[Larry DeMar]], Sam Dicker, and Paul Dussault assisted Jarvis.<ref name="Gamasutra-Defender">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4078/the_history_of_defender_the_joys_.php| title = The History of Defender: The Joys of Difficult Games| website = Gamasutra| first = Matt| last = Barton|author2=Bill Loguidice| date = 2009-07-14| access-date = 2009-12-06}}</ref> At the time, Williams had a small staff and the management was unfamiliar with technology used for its electronic games. As a result, the staff was afforded a large amount of creative freedom.<ref name="Halcyon"/>

=== Initial development ===
Space was a popular setting for video games at the time, and Jarvis felt the abstract setting would help obscure simple graphics that lacked realism.<ref name="Ultimate"/> Initially, Jarvis spent 3–4&nbsp;months developing color variations of [[Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and [[Atari, Inc.]]'s ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1">{{cite video game| title= [[Midway Arcade Treasures]]| developer= [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]]| publisher= [[Midway Games]]| date= 2003-11-18| platform= [[PlayStation 2]]| level= The Inside Story On Defender}}</ref> First inspired by ''Space Invaders'', he created a similar game with new gameplay mechanics. After spending a few weeks on the design, however, the team abandoned the idea, believing it lacked enjoyment. Development then shifted to emulating Atari's ''Asteroids'', but hardware differences between ''Asteroids'' and ''Defender''{{'}}s proposed specifications were problematic. ''Asteroids'' displays [[vector graphics]] on a special monitor, while the staff planned to use pixel graphics on a conventional monitor. The team experimented with recreating the game with pixel graphics, but also abandoned it because they felt the gameplay lacked enjoyment and visual appeal.<ref name="RG-55"/>

Believing their first attempts to be too derivative, the developers held brainstorming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of ''Asteroids''{{'}}s favorable elements was its [[Wraparound (video games)|wraparound]].<ref name="RG-55"/> They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the screen, with the visible area scrolling horizontally.<ref name="Ultimate"/><ref name="RG-55"/> Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of ''Space Invaders'' rotated 90&nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees]]. By changing the orientation of ''Space Invaders''{{'}} design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from ''Asteroids'', were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment.<ref name="RG-55"/> Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee [[Steve Ritchie (pinball designer)|Steve Ritchie]], however, convinced him the game should be able to scroll in either direction.<ref name="Ultimate"/><ref name="RG-55"/>

They just put you there, and all of a sudden you're beating people up and you start to wonder. "Why am I beating these people up?"

You know, if you're defending something, you're being attacked, and you can do whatever you wanted.| source = –Eugene Jarvis<ref name="Ultimate"/>}}

After six months of development, the team felt the game had not made enough progress. They examined other games and concluded that survival was a necessary component to implement. To achieve this, they devised enemies to present a threat, the first of which was the "Lander".<ref name="RG-55"/> Jarvis enjoyed violent, action entertainment, and wanted the game to have those elements, but felt the action should have a reasonable objective. Inspired by the 1960s television show ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', Jarvis titled the game ''Defender'', reasoning that the title helped justify the violence.<ref name="Ultimate"/> He added astronauts to expand on the space theme and give players something to defend while they shot enemies.<ref name="Ultimate"/><ref name="RG-55"/> The element of flying over a planetscape was added after a brainstorming session between Jarvis and Ritchie.<ref name="Joystik1">{{cite journal| journal = JoyStik| title = Interview: Eugene Jarvis|date=September 1982| page = 7|issue = 1}}</ref> The landscape is depicted as a line only a pixel wide, primarily because the hardware was not powerful enough to generate anything more detailed.<ref name="RG-55"/>

=== Later development ===
By July, development was behind schedule and Jarvis's superior began to pressure him to finish the game in time for a then-upcoming trade show, the AMOA, in September. Jarvis spent several weeks creating the astronauts, which his boss felt should be omitted if the process didn't speed up. The pressure frustrated him to the point he considered resigning. Around that time, a new programmer named Sam Dicker was hired.<ref name="Ultimate"/> He assisted in programming the game and added visual and audio effects.<ref name="Ultimate"/><ref name="RG-55"/> For example, Dicker implemented a particle effect [[algorithm]] to generate unique explosions for destroyed enemies.<ref name="RG-55"/> The new elements re-invigorated Jarvis, who felt the project began to show promise.<ref name="Ultimate"/>

Development then shifted focus to the enemies. Landers were given the ability to capture humans, and a new enemy was devised from the mechanic: "Mutants", captured humans that had turned hostile. The Mutants added a rescue element to the game that Jarvis believed made it more interesting to players and encouraged them to continue playing. The element of making a "comeback" from a dire situation was applied to the planet as well. Jarvis felt it mimicked the ups and downs of real life. "Bombers", enemies which release floating bombs on the screen, were added next. More enemies were added to create different gameplay elements. "Swarmers" and "Pods" were designed to attack the spaceship as opposed to the astronauts. "Baiters" were included to add pressure to the player by preventing them from lingering. The enemies quickly follow the spaceship to collide with it, and were based on a similar enemy in ''Asteroids''.<ref name="RG-55"/>

By September, the game was still unfinished, and almost every Williams programmer assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show.<ref name="Ultimate"/><ref name="GS-Hall">{{cite web| url = http://archive.gamespy.com/halloffame/may01/defender/| title = Hall of Fame: Defender| publisher = [[GameSpy]]| first = David| last = Cuciz| date = May 2001| access-date = 2009-12-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050112002131/http://archive.gamespy.com/halloffame/may01/defender/ |archive-date=2005-01-12}}</ref> The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> The developers, however, forgot to create an [[attract mode]] (an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play) and high score system for the game, and began working on them that night, with DeMar coding the attract mode, Dussault and Dicker creating the high score table, and Jarvis doing [[playtesting]] and bug fixes.<ref name=NGen38>{{cite magazine |title=Are You a Hardcore Gamer? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=38|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1998|pages=47–48}}</ref> Early the next morning, the team created the final [[EPROM]] chips for the mode and installed them in a cabinet. The chips were put in backwards, causing an [[electrical short]] when the cabinet was turned on, so the team had to quickly burn a new set of EPROMs.<ref name=NGen38/> Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes to prepare for the show.<ref name="Fever"/> After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000&nbsp;points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/>

=== Hardware ===
The game features amplified [[monaural]] sound and [[Raster graphics|pixel graphics]] on a [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT monitor]]. A [[Motorola 6809]] [[central processing unit]] handles the graphics and gameplay, while a [[Motorola 6800]] microprocessor handles the audio.<ref name="KLOV">{{cite web| url = http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7547| title = Defender - Videogame by Williams (1980)| publisher = [[Killer List of Videogames]]| access-date = 2009-12-06}}</ref> A pack of three [[AA battery|AA batteries]] provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet.

Development started by focusing on the game's hardware. The staff first debated what type of monitor to use: black-and-white or color. They reasoned that using advanced technology would better establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor. The developers estimated that the game would require 4&nbsp;colors, but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16&nbsp;colors. At the time, the designers believed that was more than they would ever need for a game.<ref name="Ultimate"/> The monitor's resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then-industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game's presentation.<ref name="RG-55">{{cite magazine|magazine= [[Retro Gamer]]| publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]| title = The Making of Defender| issue = 55| pages = 34–39|date=October 2008}}</ref> Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in [[assembly language]].<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="RG-55"/> The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.<ref name="RG-55"/>

The game's control scheme uses a two-way joystick and five buttons. Jarvis designed the controls to emulate both ''Space Invaders'' and ''Asteroids'' simultaneously. The player's left hand manipulates the joystick similar to ''Space Invaders'' and the right hand pushes buttons similar to ''Asteroids''. The button functions also use a similar layout to ''Asteroids'', with the button to shoot projectiles and accelerate on the far right and left, respectively. Jarvis reasoned that players were accustomed to the control schemes of past games, and felt altering past designs would prove difficult for them.<ref name="RG-55"/>

Co-designer Larry Demar was surprised by the game's popularity.<ref name="Ultimate"/> At the time of its release, Stan Jarocki, director of marketing at then-competitor [[Midway Games|Midway Manufacturing]],<ref group="Note">Williams Electronics purchased Midway in 1988, and later transferred its games to the [[Midway Games]] subsidiary.</ref> described the game as "amazing".<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/>

In Japan, ''Defender'' was not as highly successful, but was a moderate success.

=== Remakes and sequels ===

A green, white, and red icon in the upper right corner partially covers a brown-and-yellow alien creature.|A 2002 remake with the same name has gameplay elements similar to the original, but with 3D graphics.]]

The success of ''Defender'' prompted Williams to approach [[Vid Kidz]], who originally wanted to create a new game. DeMar, however, suggested creating an enhanced version of ''Defender'' to meet Williams' four-month deadline. Vid Kidz titled the game ''[[Stargate (1981 video game)|Stargate]]'', and developed it as a sequel to ''Defender''. It features new elements and improved the original's performance.<ref name="Halcyon"/> Some home ports of ''Stargate'' were released under the title ''Defender II'' for trademark purposes.

Williams released a ''Defender''-themed pinball machine in 1982.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/><ref name="Retro45">{{cite magazine|magazine= [[Retro Gamer]]| publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]| issue = 45| page = 49| title = A Whole Different Ball Game| first = Stuart| last = Campbell|date=January 2008}}</ref> It has many elements from the original game: sound effects, enemies, waves, and weapons. Williams produced fewer than 400 units.<ref name="Retro45"/>

Midway's 1991 ''[[Strike Force (video game)|Strike Force]]'' is an arcade update to ''Defender'' in the same way that ''[[Smash TV]]'' is an update to ''[[Robotron: 2084]]''. Jarvis and DeMar assisted with the game, but it was not widely distributed.

Atari Corporation released ''[[Defender 2000]]'' in 1995 for the [[Atari Jaguar]]. It was written by [[Jeff Minter]], who had previously updated ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]'' as ''[[Tempest 2000]]''.

''Defender'' is included in the 1996 compilation ''[[Williams Arcade's Greatest Hits]]''.

In 1997, [[Tiger Electronics]] released a handheld edition of ''Defender'' with a [[grayscale]] [[LCD]] screen, which doubles as a [[keychain]] ornament.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Gotta Hand it to Ya |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=101 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=December 1997 |page=228}}</ref>

A [[Defender (2002 video game)|2002 remake]], published simply as ''Defender'', uses [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] and a third-person viewpoint. It was released for the [[Xbox]], [[GameCube]], and [[PlayStation 2]].

===Influenced games and clones===
Home games that copied ''Defender''{{'}}s design include ''[[Gorgon (video game)|Gorgon]]'' (1981) and ''[[Repton (1983 video game)|Repton]]'' (1983) for the Apple II, ''Alien Defense'' (1981) for the TRS 80 Model III, ''Defender 64'' (1983) and ''Guardian'' (1984) for the Commodore 64, ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchas!]]'' (1983) for the ZX Spectrum, ''[[Dropzone]]'' (1984) for the Atari 8-bit computers, and for the BBC Micro ''Defender'' (1982) was renamed to ''Planetoid'' (1984) to avoid litigation.  It influenced [[Jeff Minter]]'s ''Andes Attack'' for the VIC-20 home computer,<ref>{{cite web|title=Andes Attack|url=https://llamasoftarchive.org/8bitgames/andes-attack/|website=Llamasoft Baachive}}</ref> and later his bigravitational ''[[Sheep in Space]]''.

Other games built upon the core concept of protecting people or vehicles along the ground in a horizontally scrolling world, such as ''[[Protector II]]'' for the Atari 8-bit, ''[[Chopper Command]]'' for the Atari 2600, and ''[[Choplifter]]'', all three of which were released in 1982.

Some later games were also influenced by ''Defender'', like ''[[Datastorm]]'' (1989) for the Amiga and ''[[Fantasy Zone]]'' (1986) for arcades and a variety of [[Home video game console|home consoles]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ishii |first1=Yoji |title=Fantasy Zone – 2014 Developer Interview |url=https://shmuplations.com/fantasyzone/ |website=shmuplations |access-date=15 March 2023}}</ref>

=== Cultural references ===
The game has been referenced in music: [[Lou Reed]]'s song "Down At The Arcade" on his 1984 album ''[[New Sensations]]'', [[Manilla Road]]'s song "Defender" on their 1982 album ''[[Metal (Manilla Road album)|Metal]]'', [[Buckner & Garcia]]'s song "The Defender" on their 1982 album ''[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Pac-Man Fever]]'', and the [[Beastie Boys]]' song "[[Body Movin']]" on their 1998 album ''[[Hello Nasty]]''. [[Nerdcore]] rapper [[MC Chris]] mentions ''Defender'' in the chorus of his anthemic song "Never Give Up" from his 2008 album, ''[[MC Chris is Dead]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media| people= [[Manilla Road]]| title= Album: [[Metal (Manilla Road album)|Metal]] Song: Defender| date= 1982| publisher= Roadster Records}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media| people = [[Buckner & Garcia|Jerry Buckner and Gary Garcia]]| title= Album: [[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Pac-Man Fever]] Song: The Defender| date = 1982| publisher = [[Columbia Records]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media| people = [[Beastie Boys]]| title= Album: Hello Nasty Song: Body Movin'| date = 1998-07-14| publisher = [[Capitol Records]]}}</ref> Other artists to have used sound effects from ''Defender'' include [[Aphex Twin]] (on "Mt Saint Michel + Saint Michaels Mount" and "Bucephalus Bouncing Ball"), and [[Limp Bizkit]] (used to censor swearing on the clean version of "My Generation"). The game was featured prominently in the music video for the [[Sheena Easton]] song "[[Almost Over You]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugl3pd8LUhA | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211116/Ugl3pd8LUhA| archive-date=2021-11-16 | url-status=live|title=Sheena easton - Almost over you - 1983 |last=lolymaslol|date=9 September 2010 |access-date=12 April 2018|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In an episode of the TV series ''[[CHiPs]]'' (Season 4, Episode 19), titled 'Vigilante', the game is featured in a scene where one of the characters is playing it.

[[Tim Waggoner]]'s 2004 novel ''Hyperswarm'' is based on the video game.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.timwaggoner.com/media.htm|title=Media Tie-Ins|publisher=[[Tim Waggoner]]|access-date=May 1, 2015}}</ref>

The game is used as a [[running gag]] in the [[film]] ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', where [[Groot]] is playing the game despite being told not to.

In ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'', the ship from ''Defender'' is referenced, mentioning its ability to jump into hyperspace.

In ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'', in the Shopping Mall scene, there is a ''Defender'' machine visible inside the Amusement Centre.

In the fourth episode of season 3 of ''[[NewsRadio]]'' entitled "Arcade", station manager Dave's addiction to ''Defender'' as a teenager returns when the station gets a ''Defender'' arcade machine to replace an unused sandwich machine.

Defender is one of many classic arcade games that appear in the Midway Arcade World in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', as it is played in Gamer Kid's level "Retro Wreckage", both in the start of the level, as he is shown playing Defender on his phone while he has his headphones in and it is playable in Gamer Kid's world using the Arcade Machine vehicle, which is a part of Gamer Kid's Level Pack.
