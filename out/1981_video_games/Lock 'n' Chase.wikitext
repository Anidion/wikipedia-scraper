'''''Lock 'n' Chase''''' (ロック・ン・チェイス) is a [[maze game|maze chase video game]] developed by [[Data East]] and released in arcades in Japan in 1981. It was licensed to [[Taito]] for distribution in North America. It has similarities to ''[[Pac-Man]]'', including a goal of collecting dots, with the addition of doors that periodically block pathways. Home versions for the [[Intellivision]] and [[Atari 2600]] were published by [[Mattel]] in 1982<ref name=bluesky/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=273|title=AtariAge - Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Lock 'N' Chase (M Network)|website=www.atariage.com|access-date=2006-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203734/http://www.atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=273|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> and an [[Apple II series|Apple II]] version appeared in January 1983.<ref name=bluesky>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/credits/computers.shtml|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / M Network Computer Games|website=www.intellivisionlives.com|access-date=2006-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110083256/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/credits/computers.shtml|archive-date=2007-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>

An updated version was published for the [[Game Boy]] in 1990.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Locknchase.png|left|thumb|Arcade screenshot]]
The game's protagonist is a thief. The object of the game is to enter a [[maze]] and collect all the [[coin]]s and, if possible, any other [[treasure]] that may appear. The thief must then exit the maze (a [[bank vault|vault]]) without being apprehended by the Super D ([[Police officer|policemen]]). The thief can close doorways within the maze in order to temporarily trap the Super D and allow him to keep his distance from them. Only two doors can be closed at a time. The Super D policemen are named Stiffy, Scaredy, Smarty, and Silly.<ref name=klov>{{KLOV game|id=8436|name=Lock 'N Chase}}</ref>

Coins (depicted as dots) are worth 20 [[Score (game)|points]] each. In every level, [[money bag]]s randomly appear in the center of the maze. Money bags are worth 500, 1000, 2000, and up to 4000 points, respectively, for each time they appear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/instructions/action/lock.txt |title=Cartridge instructions |website=www.intellivisionlives.com |access-date=2006-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208204424/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/instructions/action/lock.txt |archive-date=2007-02-08 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Each level also has a specific treasure that appears near the center of the maze (much like the food items in ''[[Pac-Man]]''). These treasures include the following items (listed respectively by level): [[top hat]], [[crown]], [[briefcase]], and [[telephone]]. The first three of these treasures are worth 200 points, 300 points and 500 points, respectively. Additional treasures and their point values are revealed as the player completes successive levels.<ref name=klov />
