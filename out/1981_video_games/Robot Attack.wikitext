==Gameplay==
''Robot Attack'' is a game in which the player fights against hostile robots aboard a space station.<ref name="SG"/> The player starts in a [[maze]]like room full of robots, and the goal is to destroy the robots and exit the room.<ref name=trs80/> The maze walls, robots, and the robots' shots are all deadly. After a while in each room, an indestructible "flagship" appears which performs the same function as Evil Otto in ''Berzerk''.

==Development==
Bill Hogue recorded the voice lines on tape and digitized them through the TRS-80 cassette port.<ref name="bigfive">{{cite web |last1=Hogue |first1=Bill |title=TRS-80 Games |url=http://www.bigfivesoftware.com/trs80/trs80main.htm |website=Big Five Software}}</ref>

==Reception==
Ian Chadwick reviewed ''Robot Attack'' in ''[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]]'' #12 and commented that "''Robot Attack'' is highly recommended for the nimble fingered arcade buff and even more so for the curious programmer who wishes to discover the secrets behind the usual technique of voice replication used here. Another feather in the cap of Big Five".<ref name="Ares">{{cite journal | last=Chadwick | first=Ian | title=Software | journal=[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]] | publisher=[[Simulations Publications, Inc.]] | date=January 1982| issue=12 | pages=32â€“33}}</ref>

It will quickly pay for itself by saving you quarters you are spending at the arcade".<ref name="SG"/>
