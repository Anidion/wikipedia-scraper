{{nihongo foot|'''''Galaga'''''|ギャラガ|Gyaraga|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1981 [[fixed shooter]] [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Namco]]. In North America, it was released by [[Midway Manufacturing]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Galaxian]]'' (1979), Namco's first major video game hit in arcades. Controlling a starship, the player is tasked with destroying the Galaga forces in each stage while avoiding enemies and projectiles. Some enemies can capture a player's ship via a [[tractor beam]], which can be rescued to transform the player into a "dual fighter" with additional firepower.

Shigeru Yokoyama led development with a small team. Initial planning took about two months to finish. Originally developed for the [[Namco Galaxian]] arcade board, it was instead shifted to a new system as suggested by Namco's Research and Development division. Inspiration for the dual fighter mechanic was taken from a film that Yokoyama had seen prior to development, where a ship was captured using a large circular beam. The project became immensely popular around the company, with Namco's president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] even taking interest.

Although early location tests were unsuccessful, ''Galaga'' received critical acclaim and went on to become one of the most successful arcade games, routinely appearing on Japanese and American arcade charts through 1987. It is widely regarded as a classic of the [[golden age of arcade video games]] and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. Critics applauded its gameplay, innovation, addictive nature and improvements made over its predecessor. Several home ports were released for a multitude of platforms, including the [[MSX]], [[Atari 7800]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], alongside releases on digital distribution platforms such as [[Xbox Live Arcade]]. ''Galaga'' is also included in many [[List of Bandai Namco video game compilations|Namco compilations]]. It was followed by a sequel in 1984, ''[[Gaplus]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Galaga.png|thumb|left|A Boss Galaga uses a tractor beam, while the player exchanges shots with aliens in formation.]]

''Galaga'' is a fixed shooter. The player mans a lone starfighter at the bottom of the screen, which must prevent the Galaga forces from destroying all of mankind.<ref name="Operator Manual">{{cite book |title=Galaga Parts and Operating Manual |date=October 1981 |publisher=[[Midway Games]] |page=6 |url=https://archive.org/details/arcademanual_Galaga/page/n5 |access-date=14 July 2019}}</ref> The objective of each stage is to defeat all of the Galaga aliens, which will fly into formation from the top and sides of the screen.<ref name="NES Manual"/> Similar to ''Galaxian'', aliens will dive towards the player while shooting down projectiles; colliding with either projectiles or aliens will result in a life being lost.<ref name="NES Manual"/>

Atop the enemy formation are four large aliens known as the "Boss Galaga", which take two shots to destroy.<ref name="NES Manual"/> These aliens can use a [[tractor beam]] to capture the player's ship, returning with it to the top of the formation and costing the player a life.<ref name="NES Manual"/> Should additional lives remain, the player has an opportunity to shoot down the Boss Galaga holding the captured ship. Shooting it down as it dives towards the player will result in the captured ship being rescued, and it will join the player's ship, transforming it into a "dual-fighter" with additional firepower and a larger [[hitbox]].<ref name="NES Manual"/> However, destroying a Boss Galaga with a captured ship while it is in formation will instead cause the fighter to turn against the player and act as an alien.<ref name="NES Manual"/> The ship will return in a later level as part of the formation.

Some enemies can morph into new enemy types with different attack patterns, with one even taking the form of the Galaxian Flagship.<ref name="NES Manual"/> Stages are indicated by emblems located at the bottom-right of the screen.<ref name="NES Manual"/> Enemies become more aggressive as the game progresses, increasing their number of projectiles and diving down at a faster rate.<ref name="Operator Manual"/> The third stage and every fourth thereafter is a bonus stage, where the aliens fly in a preset formation without firing at the player.<ref name="NES Manual"/>

In the original arcade version, if a player completes stage 255, (The maximum unsigned [[8-bit_computing#Details|8 bit integer]]) the next stage would be announced as stage 0, and depending on the [[DIP switch|dip switches]] on the arcade, the game resets, plays levels incorrectly, [[Glossary of video game terms#softlock|locks up]], or plays at the wrong difficulty.<ref>https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Galaga/Walkthrough#256</ref><ref>http://donhodges.com/galaga_stage_256_fix.htm</ref>{{unreliable source|date=June 2024}} This is known as a [[kill screen]].

==Development==
''Galaga'' was created by Japanese developer Shigeru Yokoyama, a long-time veteran of [[Namco]].<ref name="Galaga Interview">{{cite web |author=Namco Bandai Games |title=Galaga - 30th Anniversary Developer Interview |url=http://shmuplations.com/galaga/ |website=Galaga WEB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606111333/http://shmuplations.com/galaga/ |archive-date=6 June 2019 |date=2011 |access-date=13 July 2019|author-link=Namco Bandai Games }}</ref> Namco's first big video game hit in arcades was ''[[Galaxian]]'' (1979);<ref>{{cite book |title=Arcade Games |date=September 1982 |publisher=JoyStik |page=[https://archive.org/details/joystik_magazine-1982-09/page/n11 10] |edition=1 |url=https://archive.org/details/joystik_magazine-1982-09 |access-date=14 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |author-link=Steven L.

By the early 1980s the game was becoming harder to sell, so to help clear out inventory, Yokoyama was tasked with creating two new games that could run on the Namco Galaxian board.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> The first of these was ''[[King & Balloon]]'' (1980),<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> a fixed shooter that is cited as the first video game to incorporate speech.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vark |first1=Aaron |title=King & Balloon |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/king-balloon/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=13 December 2014 |access-date=13 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502104309/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/king-balloon/ |archive-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> The second game was instead made for newer hardware as suggested by Namco's Research & Development division.<ref name="Galaga Interview" /> This new arcade board was named the [[Namco Galaga]] and was used in games including ''[[Bosconian]]'' (1981)<ref>{{cite web |title=Bosconian - Videogame by Midway Manufacturing Co |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7196 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |access-date=13 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522000641/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7196 |archive-date=22 May 2019}}</ref> and ''[[Dig Dug]]'' (1982).<ref>{{cite web |title=Dig Dug - Videogame by Atari |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7581 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |access-date=13 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613205848/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7581 |archive-date=13 June 2019}}</ref> Although Yokoyama was not given explicit instructions to make a shooting game, management expressed desire for him to make a game similar to ''Galaxian''.<ref name="Galaga Interview" />  Initial planning for the project took two months.<ref name="Galaga Interview" />

The idea for the dual fighter stemmed from Yokoyama wanting to create enemies with different attack styles.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> The tractor beam emitted by the Boss Galaga was inspired by a film in which a character's ship was captured by a circling laser.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> Yokoyama incorporated this idea into ''Galaga'', whereby an enemy could capture the player's ship with a beam and the ship would need to be rescued.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> Originally, rescuing a captured ship would award the player an extra life, but this was soon changed to having it fight alongside the player.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> This idea proved to be a problem at first; due to hardware limitations, the game could only display a limited number of [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], resulting in the dual-fighter being unable to shoot any more missiles.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> As a workaround, Yokoyama made a 16x16 sprite for the ship and a 16x16 sprite for the bullets, reducing the total sprite count by two.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/>

Inspired by the intermissions in ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980) and bonus stages in ''[[Rally-X]]'' (1980), Yokoyama added a special bonus level.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> While planning, lead programmer Tetsu Ogawa informed him of a [[software bug|bug]] whereby enemies would simply fly off the screen instead of moving into formation.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> Ogawa expressed interest in incorporating the idea into the game, leading to the inclusion of the Challenging Stages.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> Enemies originally flew in one type of pattern, with more being added to increase replay value.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> Graphic designer [[Hiroshi Ono (artist)|Hiroshi Ono]] designed many of the sprites, including the player's ship and the Boss Galaga alien.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/>

Prior to location testing, the team focused on designing the instruction card, a sheet of paper that showed how the game was played.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> The text was done by the planners, while the actual design was handled by a graphic artist.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> The card originally showed the control layout and the basics of the game, which was stripped early on for being too boring.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> Yokoyama suggested that the card instead show off the dual fighter mechanic, as a means to draw in players.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> The team kept bringing in designs to Namco president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]], who continued to reject them until he ordered the team to simply make it in front of him.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/>

The team was allowed to set their own deadlines, due to Namco's then-laidback corporate structure.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> Feedback on the project was given by Nakamura and other employees, including ''Pac-Man'' creator [[Toru Iwatani]].<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> Despite the game's immense popularity around the company, early location tests failed to meet expectations due to players being able to progress a long way with only one coin, thus generating low income.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> Although Yokoyama stated that the game's popularity could still generate income, Namco executives instructed the team to increase the difficulty level.<ref name="Galaga Interview"/> ''Galaga'' was released in Japan in September 1981.<ref name="Den of Geek">{{cite web |last1=Cummins |first1=Chris |title=Celebrating 35 Years of Galaga |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/galaga/258619/celebrating-35-years-of-galaga |website=Den of Geek |access-date=13 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701095328/https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/galaga/258619/celebrating-35-years-of-galaga |archive-date=1 July 2019 |date=8 November 2016}}</ref> It was released in North America by [[Midway Games]] in October of that year.<ref name="Operator Manual"/>
