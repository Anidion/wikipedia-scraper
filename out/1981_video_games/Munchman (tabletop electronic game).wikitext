'''''Munchman''''' is a tabletop [[electronic game]] that was released under licence in 1981<ref name="munchman">{{cite web|url=http://www.imarshall.karoo.net/munchman.htm|quote=Grandstand Munchman Handheld Pacman game.

==Hardware==
The ''Munchman'' game runs on six volts DC and can be powered by four 'C' type batteries or alternatively via a low voltage mains adaptor.<ref name="TV Cream Toys 1">{{cite book |title=TV Cream Toys|last=Berry |first=Steve|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins UK|location=UK|isbn=978-0-00-732851-2|quote=It wasn't long before an investment was made in an AC/DC adapter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIroTCM02Y0C&q=grandstand+munchman&pg=PT161|accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref> As the display is based on [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] technology, it allows bright, multicoloured in-game elements to be rendered but at the cost of a relatively small screen size. The VFD display is manufactured with the pre-formed, immutable in-game objects effectively fixed in place onto a dark background. Each element can be individually lit or unlit during play, giving the illusion of animation and movement. In-game objects cannot touch or superimpose one another, which is not ideal for a Pac-Man clone, as in the arcade version, the Pac-Man and ghosts do collide.

==Gameplay==
[[File:GrandstandMunchmanDisplay.jpg|thumb|right|The play area]]
As with most ''Pac-Man'' derived games, the player must guide the ''Pac-Man'' character around a maze, eating all of the dots whilst avoiding the ghosts. Notable features of this version are that the maze is small, containing only eighteen dots plus two power pills.<ref name="PacMan" /> Also, dots are only eaten if the player happens to move over them from right to left. There is a bonus cherry item sometimes available near the centre of the maze and horizontal warp tunnels can also be used by the player. The score is kept at the top of the display area, above the maze. There are two difficulty levels,<ref name="retrovideogamer">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrovideogamer.co.uk/index.php?page=tabletops|title=Retro Video Gamer - Tabletops|quote=Two skill levels and unlimited scoring.

==Reception==
In the 21st century, the game has been described as "a weak version" of the ''Pac-Man'' arcade game.<ref name="PacMan"/> The elementary sound has been described as "shrill" and "beepy"<ref name="childofthe1980s"/> and the sound during an active powerpill as "an irritating clicking noise".<ref name="galaxyarcade">{{Cite web|title=Retro-gaming nostalgia: Grandstand Munchman|url=http://www.galaxyarcade.co.uk/retro/grandstand-munchman.php|publisher=Galaxy Graphics|accessdate=2011-09-26|quote=Of all the electronic hand-helds to have at school in the early 1980s, the Grandstand Munchman was the king at my school}}</ref> The graphics have also been criticised as the collisions are unrealistic because the ghosts and munchman can never occupy the same space.<ref name="galaxyarcade"/> However, the product design has also been described as "gorgeous"<ref name="galaxyarcade"/> and has been generally praised.<ref name="childofthe1980s"/><ref name="pocketgamer">{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Multiformat/Handheld+Classics/feature.asp?c=12051|quote=the experience is surprisingly robust, despite the ravages of time.|first=Damien|last=McFerran|title=Handheld Classics: Retro Roundup|publisher=Steel Media Ltd|date=2009-03-12|accessdate=2011-09-29}}</ref>
