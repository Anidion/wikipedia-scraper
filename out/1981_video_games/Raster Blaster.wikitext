'''''Bill Budge's Raster Blaster''''' (or '''''Rasterblaster''''' on the disk label) is a home computer pinball simulation written by [[Bill Budge]] for the [[Apple II]] and published in 1981 by Budge's company, BudgeCo. It was ported to the [[Atari 8-bit computers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Raster Blaster|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-raster-blaster_4292.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref> ''Raster Blaster'' resembles the Williams ''[[Firepower (pinball)|Firepower]]'' table from 1980.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

While not the first pinball game for home computers, ''Raster Blaster'' set a higher bar for visual fidelity, and the next several years saw a flurry of Apple II pinball titles: ''[[David's Midnight Magic]]'' (1982), ''[[Night Mission Pinball]]'' (1982), and Budge's own ''[[Pinball Construction Set]]'' (1983).

''Raster Blaster'' was voted ''[[Softalk]]'' magazine's Most Popular Program of 1981.<ref>"Most Popular Program of 1981: Raster Blaster!" Softalk. April 1982.</ref>

''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' stated when reviewing ''[[David's Midnight Magic]]'' that it "ratifies Bill Budge's extraordinary program as a programming tour de force" and "proof of Budge's technical lead over his rivals", as ''Midnight'' was merely equal to ''Raster Blaster'' despite being nine months ("an eternity in the Apple II world") newer.<ref name="tommervik198201">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=6&id=3 | title=David's Midnight Magic | work=Softline | date=January 1982 | accessdate=13 July 2014 | author=Tommervik, Al | pages=32}}</ref>
