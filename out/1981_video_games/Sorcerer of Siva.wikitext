'''''Sorcerer of Siva''''' is a 1981 video game published by [[Automated Simulations]] for the [[Apple II]] and [[TRS-80]]. The last standalone ''[[Dunjonquest]]'' game, ''Sorcerer of Siva'' is not as large as the major releases in the series, but also not as small as the ''MicroQuests''.

==Gameplay==
The player takes the role of a wizard, who is thrown into a labyrinth of mines by his rival.<ref name="siva-manual-a">{{Cite book|title=The Sorcerer of Siva|date=1981|page=3}}</ref> While the dungeon layout is still fixed, the players starting point within is determined at random. The combat system is different from the other titles in the series, as it is based on a set of spells instead of weapons. Fatigue is replaced with a magic aura, which determines the remaining strength to cast spells. During the game, the evil sorcerer sometimes appears to cause the player character to forget spells, which can be remembered again by finding ''touchstones'' within the mines.<ref name="siva-manual-b">{{Cite book|work=The Sorcerer of Siva|title=Forgetting & Remembering Spells|date=1981|page=18}}</ref>

==Reception==
[[Bruce Webster]] reviewed ''Sorcerer of Siva'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 54.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last= Webster |first= Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Webster |date=August 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=54|pages=27}}</ref> Webster commented that "If you've never played any of Epyx's adventure games, then I can easily recommend ''Sorcerer'' to you.  If you've played some of the, then I can recommend this one if the theme appeals to you.  If you've played most of them, you won't find anything all that new or exciting here."<ref name="SG"/>
