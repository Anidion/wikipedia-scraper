'''''Solar Fox''''' is an [[arcade game]] released in 1981 by Bally/Midway. It was ported to the [[Atari 2600]] console and was also released as a [[Commodore International|Commodore]]-published cartridge for the [[Commodore 64]] computer in 1983.<ref name=lemon>{{lemon64 game|id=3003|name=Solar Fox}}</ref>

==Gameplay==

The player's task is to pilot a starship through a series of squared solar cell matrixes inside a rack. While capturing the cells the player must dodge waves of fireballs that are being thrown by Sentinels. These Sentinels move continuously along the perimeter of each cell formation. When an entire field of squares is completed (by flying through each square), the game advances to the next rack. The faster a matrix is cleared, the more points are received.

There are 26 solar cell matrix shapes. Every fifth matrix is a Challenge rack. During challenge racks there are no fireballs; the goal is to clear the entire field before the time runs out. Completing each Challenge round awards a letter, to form the mystery word ''Helios''.<ref>[http://2600connection.atari.org/eastereggs/26solarfox.html 2600 Connection Solar Fox Info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224041803/http://2600connection.atari.org/eastereggs/26solarfox.html |date=2013-02-24 }}</ref>

==Port==
The game would later be released on the [[Atari 2600]] console and was also developed as a [[Commodore International|Commodore]]-published cartridge for the [[Commodore 64]] computer in 1983.<ref name=lemon/>

An [[Atari 5200]] port program written by Van Tran (of ''[[Wabbit (video game)|Wabbit]]'' fame) was completed but never released.<ref name="VanTranInterview">{{Cite web |last1=Bunch |first1=Kevin |last2=Willaert |first2=Kate |date=May 13, 2022 |title=Pioneer Rediscovered: The Woman Who Brought Female Representation To Games: The year-long search for Van Mai comes to a happy conclusion. |url=https://gamehistory.org/wabbit |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=May 13, 2022 |website=GameHistory}}</ref>
