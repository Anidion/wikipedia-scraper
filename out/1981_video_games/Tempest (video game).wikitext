'''''Tempest''''' is a 1981 [[arcade video game]] by [[Atari, Inc.]], designed and programmed by [[Dave Theurer]]. It takes place on a three-dimensional surface divided into lanes, sometimes as a closed tube, and viewed from one end. The player controls a claw-shaped "blaster" that sits on the edge of the surface, snapping from segment to segment as a rotary knob is turned, and can fire blaster shots to destroy enemies and obstacles by pressing a button.

''Tempest'' was one of the first games to use Atari's Color-[[QuadraScan]] [[vector graphics|vector]] display technology. It was also the first to let players choose their starting level (a system Atari called "SkillStep"). This feature increases the preferred starting level, which therefore could also be used to allowing the player to [[Continue (video games)|continue]] the previous game if they wished. ''Tempest'' was one of the first video games with a progressive [[level design]] where the levels themselves varied rather than giving the player the same layout with increasing difficulty.

==Gameplay==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2020}}
[[File:Arcade-atari-tempest1.png|thumb|left|220px|The arcade version with the player's lane in yellow and three red flippers moving along the rim]]
The goal in ''Tempest'' is to survive for as long as possible, and score as many points as possible, by clearing the screen of enemies that appear on the playing field. The player controls a blaster at the near end of the field, moving it left and right using a rotary knob. The player's blaster can rapid-fire shots down individual lanes of the field, destroying any enemies within the same lane. The blaster is also equipped with a "Superzapper" which, once per level, destroys all enemies currently on the field, a second use of the Superzapper in the same level destroys one random enemy. The Superzapper is recharged between each level.

The game features sixteen unique levels of different shapes, including simple geometric shapes, a flat line, and the [[infinity symbol|symbol for infinity]]. Some levels are closed tubes that allow the player to loop throughout it continuously, while others have definite left and right endpoints. When all sixteen levels have been played, the sequence repeats with a different color scheme and higher difficulty. One set of levels (65 through 80) is "invisible" (black). After reaching Stage 99, the level counter stops increasing and each successive level shape is picked randomly.

Enemies first appear on the screen as swirling dots beyond the far end of the field, appearing on the field one at a time. There are seven types of enemies in the game, each with their own behavior pattern. Flippers attempt to catch the player's blaster and drag it to the far end of the playfield. Pulsars periodically electrify the lane that they occupy—if the blaster is in that lane at that moment, it is destroyed. Fuseballs jump forward and back unpredictably along the edges of each lane, moving slowly between them to give the player a brief opportunity to shoot them. Spikers roll toward the player and extend spikes into a lane, which the player can wear down by shooting it. After the first few levels, each level starts with short spikes at the far end of the field. Later levels also feature Fuseball and Pulsar Tankers, which split into two Fuseballs or two Pulsars when hit, respectively. Most enemies can shoot bullets at the blaster, destroying it upon impact.

When all enemies on the field have been destroyed, the player "warps" to the next level by traveling down the field and into the space beyond it. The player must avoid or destroy any spikes that are in the way; hitting one will destroy the blaster and force the player to try the warp again.

The player loses a life when their blaster is destroyed or captured, and the game ends when all lives are lost. Bonus blasters (up to six at a time) are awarded at certain score intervals.

==Development==
The game was initially meant to be a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[Video game remake|remake]] of ''[[Space Invaders]]'',<ref name=EGM103>{{cite magazine |title=Bad Dreams, Man|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |publisher=Ziff Davis |issue=103 |date=February 1998 |page=86}}</ref> but early versions had many problems, so a new design was used. Theurer says the design came from a [[nightmare]] where monsters crawled out of a hole in the ground.<ref name=EGM103/><ref name="KLOV">[http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10065 Tempest - Videogame by Atari], The International Arcade Museum</ref> This led to him coming up with the design concept, stating he "basically just took ''Space Invaders'' and wrapped the surface into a circle," while monsters "come down the tunnel at you, out of the hole, and you [try] to kill them before they [get] out."<ref name=missile-command>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/8/15/4528228/missile-command-dave-theurer |title=The Creation of Missile Command and the haunting of its creator, Dave Theurer |publisher=polygon.com |date=2013-08-15 |access-date=2014-06-05}}</ref> During the prototype stages the game was called ''Aliens'', then ''Vortex'', and finally ''Tempest''.<ref name="KLOV"/>

Three different cabinet designs exist for ''Tempest''. The most common is an upright cabinet that, viewed from the side, is in the shape of a [[Special right triangles|right triangle]] sitting on a rectangle. This cabinet sported colorful side art. A shorter, less flashy cabaret-style cabinet was also released with optional side art. A cocktail-style table cabinet allowed two players to play at opposite ends of the table; the screen automatically flipped for each player.

In the first games Atari shipped there were glitches in one or more of the ROM chips. The problem code allowed a player to do unintended things when ending their score in certain two-digit combinations. According to ''Joystik'' magazine, which detailed these combinations, the most useful were the ones that earned the player 40 free credits (06, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18) and the "jump to green" trick (46).<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Joystik |title=Tricks of the Trade |date=September 1983 |publisher=Publications International, Ltd |location=Skokie, IL |page=60 |volume=2 |number=1 |url=https://archive.org/details/joystik_magazine-1983-09/page/n61/mode/2up}}</ref> Another useful combination mentioned was 05 which allowed the player to play the game in the attract mode. In this scenario pausing at one the combinations would cause the effect to take place immediately without losing the balance of the player's lives. Also, in the attract mode, pausing at an end score of 48 gave the player 255 extra lives. After this issue was discovered, Atari corrected the problem so that further shipping machines were incapable of allowing the end score tricks. It was also noted in ''Joystik'' that Atari shipped updated chips to be replaced in the field.

==Ports==
An official port was released for the [[Atari ST]]. An official port that bears the Atari logo was released by [[Superior Software]] for the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] in 1985, and another by [[Electric Dreams Software|Electric Dreams]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1987.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Versions for the [[Atari 2600]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/tempest/tempest.htm |title=Tempest (Atari 2600) |last=Reichert |first=Matt |work=AtariProtos.com |access-date=2013-02-08}}</ref> and [[Atari 5200|5200]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/5200/software/tempest/tempest.htm |title=Tempest (Atari 5200) |last=Reichert |first=Matt |work=AtariProtos.com |access-date=2013-02-08}}</ref> were in the works in Atari, Inc. during 1984, and unfinished [[prototype]]s exist for both of them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] 3.x as part of the ''[[Microsoft Arcade]]'' package.

[[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] wrote in 1982 that unlike ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''Tempest'' "intimidates many beginners because [[game balance|it appears to be unwinnable]]"; its smoothly increasing difficulty, however, encourages players to continue playing.<ref name="crawford198212">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-12/1982_12_BYTE_07-12_Game_Plan_1982#page/n97/mode/2up | title=Design Techniques and Ideas for Computer Games | magazine=BYTE | date=December 1982 | access-date=19 October 2013 |last=Crawford |first=Chris | pages=96}}</ref> In 1995, [[Flux (magazine)|Flux]] magazine ranked the game 6th on their Top 100 Video Games.

The game's difficulty advances smoothly, and the play is extremely well balanced".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 100 Games of All Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=September 1996|page=44}}</ref> ''Tempest'' is #10 on the [[Killer List of Videogames|KLOV's]] list of most popular games, tied with ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]''.

==Legacy==
Shortly after the original game was released, an arcade owner named Duncan Brown hacked the level data and made an altered, more difficult version: ''Tempest Tubes''. It was eventually included with ''Tempest'' in the Hasbro compilation ''Atari Arcade Hits: Volume 1'' for Microsoft Windows in 1999.

===Sequels===
[[Jeff Minter]] created two authorized games, released long after the original: ''[[Tempest 2000]]'' (1994) for the [[Atari Jaguar]] (renamed ''Tempest X3'' for the [[PlayStation]] port), and ''[[Tempest 3000]]'' (2000) for [[Nuon (DVD technology)|Nuon]] enhanced DVD players. In July 2018, ''[[Tempest 4000]]'' was released for multiple platforms.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/07/tempest-4000-finally-lives-after-delays-legal-threats-but-whats-up-on-pc/ |title=Tempest 4000 finally lives after delays, legal threats—but what's up on PC? |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |date=17 July 2018 |access-date=19 April 2019 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}</ref> Minter also wrote two games inspired by ''Tempest'': ''[[Space Giraffe]]'' (2007) and ''[[TxK]]'' (2014). After ''TxK'' was released for the [[PlayStation Vita]], the current incarnation of Atari blocked release of the game for additional platforms<ref>{{cite news |title=Atari blocks Jeff Minter from releasing new versions of TxK |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/atari-blocks-jeff-minter-from-releasing-new-versions-of-txk/0146828 |magazine=[[MCV/Develop]] |access-date=March 18, 2015 |first=Ben |last=Parfitt |date=18 March 2015 |publisher=[[NewBay Media]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619220052/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/atari-blocks-jeff-minter-from-releasing-new-versions-of-txk/0146828 |archive-date=19 June 2016}}</ref> until it was reworked as ''[[Tempest 4000]]'' some years later.
