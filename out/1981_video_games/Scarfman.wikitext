'''''Scarfman''''' is a clone of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' written by Philip A. Oliver for the [[TRS-80]] computer and published by [[The Cornsoft Group]] in 1981.{{r|dobson20121126}}<ref name=giantlist/> A version for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] followed in 1982 as '''''Color Scarfman''''', which uses 64x64 low resolution graphics.<ref name=boyle/>

Oliver also wrote the Enhanced [[BASIC]] Compiler for the TRS-80 Model III and 4.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Reed |first1=Matthew |title=EnhComp |url=http://www.trs-80.org/enhcomp/ |website=TRS-80.org}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
''Scarfman'' is a game in which the player is Scarfman, trying to eat the dots in a maze filled with them along with five power capsules, avoiding the five monsters that roam the maze.<ref name="SG"/> Unlike ''Pac-Man'', there are five monsters instead of four. Eating a power pill causes monsters to lower their eyes, indicating that they're vulnerable. The eyes shift to the normal position when the pill's effect wears off.<ref name=reed/>{{r|dobson20121126}} In ''Color Scarfman'', eating a power pill causes the ghosts to remain vulnerable&mdash;indicated by turning blue&mdash;until eaten or the level ends.<ref name=boyle/>

==Reception==
Dan Ekblaw reviewed ''Scarfman'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' number 54. Ekblaw commented that "Overall, I would say that ''Scarfman'''s defects outweigh its good points by far.  I've found that this game loses its novelty after a few weeks and will spend the rest of its days sitting on a shelf".<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Ekblaw |first=Dan |date=August 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=54|pages=30, 32}}</ref>

In a 2012 retrospective, ''[[Gamasutra]]'' wrote that the "chirp-chirp-chirp chomping sound effect is maddening. But it does play like ''Pac-Man'', more or less".<ref name="dobson20121126">{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/182224/games_from_the_trash_the_history_.php |title=Games from the Trash: The History of the TRS-80 |last=Dobson |first=Dale |date=2012-11-26 |website=Gamasutra |language=en |access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>
