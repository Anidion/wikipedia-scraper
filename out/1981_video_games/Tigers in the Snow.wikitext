It was the first video game to feature the [[Battle of the Bulge]] of 1944 and 1945, a decisive Allied victory over German forces in World War II, as its subject.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/12/26/the-flare-path-battle-of-the-bulge-wargames/|title = The Flare Path: Bulges|newspaper = Rock Paper Shotgun|date = 26 December 2014}}</ref> Heavily inspired by board games, the game was played on a hexagonal grid and included such features as a supply, terrain and weather system.

==Reception==
Richard Charles Karr reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', writing:
{{blockquote|''Tigers In The Snow'' is enjoyable as a "situation in doubt" game, with the possibility of German break-outs threatening to roll up the American line. The tension of hoping your perfectly laid plans don't disintegrate in your face can keep you riveted in your seat for hours. Although the game is not as innovative as other SSI games it is a design which deserves attention as part of the improving integration of wargames and computer software.<ref name="CGW3">{{cite magazine |last=Karr |first=Richard Charles |title=Tigers in the Snow: A Review |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=March–April 1982 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=30–31}}</ref>}}

A 1993 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' survey of wargames gave ''Tigers in the Snow'' one star out of five, stating that its primitive graphics, play mechanics, and user interface "have been superseded by more recent efforts".<ref name="brookssurvey199310">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Brooks' Book Of Wargames: 1900-1950, R-Z | magazine=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | accessdate=26 March 2016 | author=Brooks, M.
