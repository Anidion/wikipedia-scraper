==Reception==
Harvey B. Herman for ''[[Compute!]]'' said "An old fogey, like me, enjoyed it, but found it almost impossible to land on more difficult sites. The kids found it challenging but learned how to do it almost every time."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1982-06-compute-magazine/page/n105/mode/2up|title=Compute!
