==Gameplay==
[[File:Spacechase_Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot]]

In orbit of an unnamed "[[natural satellite|moon]]," the player uses a Starcruiser to destroy formations of [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] enemy raiders that attack from above. The lunar surface rotates in the background, but has no effect on gameplay. The player's ship can maneuver in eight directions within the lower third of the game screen. As the game advances, the aliens attacks begin to include "Lazer-Directed Heat-Seeking Proton Missiles".

There are single and two-player games; players alternate turns in the latter. The game can be handicapped for each player by setting the Atari's Difficulty Switch. In the "A" position the player's shots are slower than when the switch is in the "B" position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=471 |title=Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Spacechase (Apollo) |publisher=AtariAge |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Spacechase'' became Apollo's best selling title. Apollo also marketed ''Spacechase'' with an offer to make customized or "monogrammed" versions of ''Spacechase''. Less than 10 were sold, and several were given to press including ''[[Electronic Games]]'' magazine co-founder Arnie Katz.

''[[PM Magazine]]'' visited Apollo's offices to film a segment on Apollo and ''Spacechase'', with [[Leeza Gibbons]] doing the interview. The segment included programmer Ed Salvo making a customized ''Spacechase'' for Gibbons, changing three shapes in the explosion graphic to her initials. When her ship was destroyed, Leeza's initials appeared.<ref name="dpinterview" />
