==Reception==
Dave Jones reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "I feel that while the graphics of ''Voyager I'' are good the game design itself is too simplistic to hold the interest of the average computer game player for very long. If persistence is your "thing" you will find Voyager I interesting but those who enjoy employing strategies or arcade arcade skills will probably want to look elsewhere."<ref name="CGW4">{{cite magazine |last=Jones |first=Dave |title=Voyager I: Sabotage of the Robot Ship |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=May–June 1982 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=16, 38}}</ref>

Bruce Berrien reviewed ''Voyager I'' in ''[[Space Gamer]]'' No. 67.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Berrien |first=Bruce |date=Jan–Feb 1984 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=67|pages=34–35}}</ref> Berrien commented that "the game is slow-moving and rather boring [...] ''Voyager I'' quickly becomes predictable."<ref name="SG"/>
