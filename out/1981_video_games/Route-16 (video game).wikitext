{{nihongo foot|'''''Route-16'''''|ルート16|Rūto 16|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a driving [[Maze game|maze]] [[video game]] released in arcades by [[Tecmo|Tehkan]] and [[Sunsoft|Sun Electronics]] in 1981. The game was licensed to [[Centuri]] for distribution in the [[United States]]. It was ported to the [[Arcadia 2001]] console. An enhanced version was released in Japan as ''Route-16 Turbo'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in 1985, and in 2001 as part of the [[PlayStation]] game ''Sunsoft Memorial Vol. 2''.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a car and must explore a maze divided into sixteen rooms. The player must collect all the money bags while avoiding colliding with opponents' cars or running out of fuel. Every time the player goes out of a room, a large [[overworld]] map is shown, indicating the position of every car and all the money bags.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |title=Five great (but forgotten) alternatives to Pac-Man from the early '80s |url=https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2017/06/five-great-but-forgotten-alternatives.html |website=Digitally Downloaded |access-date=7 December 2023 |date=8 June 2017}}</ref> There are also flags that can be driven over to invert the roles, so the player can crash the opposite cars and stop them for a few seconds, while getting bonus points.

==Legacy==
''Route-16'' distinguished itself from other [[maze game|maze games]] with the addition of a large [[overworld]] map, showing the locations of the player, cars, maze and treasures.<ref name=":0" />[[image:Route-16 turbo boxart.png|thumb|''Route-16 Turbo'' box art]]

{{nihongo foot|''Route-16 Turbo'',|ルート16ターボ|Rūto 16 Tābo|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} an improved version of ''Route-16'' for the Famicom, was published on October 4, 1985, by [[Sunsoft]] only in [[Japan]]. ''Route-16 Turbo'' added multiple difficulty levels and improved graphics and music. 

Due to a programming bug, the Famicom version will never recognise that round 9 is completed, preventing players from going further without emulation. It is unknown whether it is present on the PlayStation version.
