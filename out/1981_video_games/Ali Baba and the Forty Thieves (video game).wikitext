'''''Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves''''' is [[dungeon crawler|dungeon crawl]] [[role-playing video game]] written by Stuart Smith for the [[Atari 8-bit computers]] and published by [[Quality Software]] 1981. An [[Apple II]] version was released in 1982, followed by ports for the [[FM-7]] and the [[PC-8800 series]] in 1985. It is the second of four role playing games written by Smith, following ''Fracas'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mocagh.org/loadpage.php?getgame=fracas-alt|title=Computer Game Museum Display Case - Fracas|website=www.mocagh.org}}</ref> and preceding ''[[The Return of Heracles]]'' and ''[[Adventure Construction Set]]''.

The player plays as [[Ali Baba]], and travels through a maze-like map of the city and surrounding wilderness in order to rescue a [[princess]].  The game involves interaction with shopkeepers and enemies throughout the game's extensive map. ''Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves'' incorporates some ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' conventions as well as various mythological and superstitious elements into the storyline and environment. These include the [[Western zodiac]] and ancient [[Arabian mythology|Arabic fairytales]]. The game is also notable for several features rarely seen in RPGs at the time: cooperative multi-player for up to 17 players (using a 'hot-seat'), player defined objectives, and the option to complete the game peacefully (without attacking enemies).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mocagh.org/loadpage.php?getgame=alibabaorig|title=Computer Game Museum Display Case - Ali Baba|website=www.mocagh.org}}</ref>
