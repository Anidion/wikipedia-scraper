==Gameplay==
''Southern Command'' is a game in which the player plays as the Israelis during the [[Yom Kippur War]].<ref name="CGW3"/>

==Reception==
Bob Proctor reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "''Southern Command'' is an outstanding game and a very realistic historical simulation. The rule book and two reference cards are of SSI's usual (high) quality. The only thing I could want would be an option to play the Egyptian side solitaire, but programming the computer to play the Israelis would not be a trivial task. Still, it will keep me busy trying to crack that Egyptian defense at the highest difficulty level. I urge you to try it too."<ref name="CGW3">{{cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |title=Southern Command |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=March–April 1982 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=6–9}}</ref>
