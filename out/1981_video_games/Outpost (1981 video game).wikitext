}}'''''Outpost''''' is a [[fixed shooter]] for the [[Apple II]] programmed by Tom McWilliams and published by [[Sirius Software]] in 1981. It is a variant of the arcade game ''[[Space Zap]]''. 

In March 1982, [[NBC News]] reported that ''Outpost'' earned McWilliams, then still a teenager, earned at least US$60,000.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Michael Z.|title=Atari Age: The Emergence of Video Games in America|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262338196|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y20ODgAAQBAJ&pg=PA173|accessdate=27 December 2017|page=173|language=en|quote=An NBC News segment airing March 8, 1982, profiled Tom McWilliams, a suburban teenager from California who earned $60,000 from the proceeds of his 1981 game Outpost.}}</ref>

==Legacy==
According to [[Tim Skelly]], the [[Cinematronics]] port of ''Outpost'' which was being worked on by Scott Boden was reworked after their departure from Cinematronics as the more cutesy title ''Boxing Bugs'' by Jack Ritter, which both Skelly and Boden considered a "travesty".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Skelly|first1=Tim|authorlink1=Tim Skelly|editor=Mark J.

In [Scott] Boden's own words, "The last thing I was working on was ''Outpost'' (1981), which had a cannon and a gun in the center with attackers on the periphery. I left and Jack Ritter took over. He renamed it ''[[Boxing Bugs]]'' (1981) and tried to make it cute." In my opinion and Boden's, ''Boxing Bugs'' was a travesty.}}</ref>
