'''''Epoch''''' is a [[space combat simulator]] for the [[Apple II]] written by Larry Miller and published by [[Sirius Software]] in 1981.<ref name="giantlist"/>

==Gameplay==
''Epoch'' uses a first-person camera to aim at oncoming enemy spaceships. The player must steer the [[reticle]] in-line with the enemy ships in order to destroy them before they destroy the player's ship. The player does not have infinite ammo or fuel, but can steer the ship towards friendly spaceships and bases to refuel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/epoch|title=Epoch for Apple II (1981)|website=MobyGames|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

==Reception==
Ron Boerger reviewed ''Epoch'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 48, commenting that "this is an excellent game. If you like arcade-type games, ''Epoch'' is a must; it's among the best out for the Apple."<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Boerger|first=Ron|date=February 1982|title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=48|pages=36}}</ref>

Barry Gittleman reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "If you are the type that likes simple games, like ''Space Invaders'', pinball, etc., you will probably have a bit of trouble adjusting to ''Epoch'', which at times can be a very high speed game. Most computer gamers, especially space and shoot-em-up lovers, will enjoy this game. It is planned out in detail, and well programmed."<ref name="CGW6">{{cite magazine |last=Gittleman |first=Barry |title=Micro - Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=September–October 1982 |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=41–42}}</ref>
