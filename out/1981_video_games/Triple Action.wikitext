'''''Triple Action''''' is an [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] produced by [[Mattel|Mattel Electronics]] for its [[Intellivision]] [[gaming console|video game system]] in [[1981 in video gaming|1981]]. The game actually includes three separate games—racing, tank combat and flying—where two players compete against each other for the best score.

==History==
During the game's development, it was known internally as ''Some of Theirs'', as many of the games proposed for the title were clones of games produced by Mattel's main competitor, [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]].<ref name="INTVlives"/> The limited amount of memory available lowered the number of proposed games from six to five.<ref name="INTVlives"/> Ultimately, three games remained after an internal review by the company's attorneys determined that two of the games, a [[Breakout (video game)|''Breakout''-style]] game and a [[Pong|''Pong''-style]] game, could have prompted a lawsuit from Atari.<ref name="INTVlives"/> Prior to release, the game was called ''3-in-1 Arcade'' before being changed to ''Triple Action''.<ref name="INTVlives"/>

==Gameplay==
''Triple Action'' contains three separate games: "Battle Tanks," "Car Racing" and "Biplanes." Players choose the desired game from an on-screen menu, then choose from available options for that particular game.<ref name="TAInst">{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/instructions/action/3action.txt|title=Triple Action Instructions|work=IntellivisionLives.com|access-date=2010-06-18}}</ref>

In "Battle Tanks," players maneuver their tanks around the battlefield, with the first player to shoot their opponent 15 times being declared the winner. The game's options adjust the range of the players' shots and can enable them to ricochet off of obstacles. If ricocheting shots are selected, players may be hit by their own shots, which would score points for the opponent.<ref name="TAInst"/>

"Car Racing" is a race that spans {{convert|100|mi|km}}, with each player on a separate section of road. Players must dodge traffic in order to reach the finish line before their opponent. Players can adjust the amount of vehicle traffic prior to the start of the race.<ref name="TAInst"/>

The object of "Biplanes" is to score 15 points by shooting down the balloon or the enemy's biplane. Before the game begins, players can choose between short-range and long-range shots.<ref name="TAInst"/>

==Legacy==
''Triple Action'' is included in the ''[[Intellivision Lives!]]'' compilation for computers and video game consoles, including the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]]. In June 2010, [[Microsoft]] made the game available through its ''[[Game Room]]'' service for [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].

==Reception==
''Triple Action'' was favorably reviewed in 1982 by ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine where it was described as "a completely legitimate effort" on behalf of Mattel to create another [[tank game]] after the success of ''[[Armor Battle]]''. Although the tank and air-combat portions of the game were characterized respectively as "pure arcade action" and "delightful in many respects", the cars portion was dismissed by reviewers as "nothing major".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= March 1982 |title= Arcade Alley: Mixed Reviews for Intellivision |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 5|issue= 12|pages= 40–42|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|42}} ''Triple Action'' would go on to be honored with a Certificate of Merit in the category of "Best Video Game Audiovisual Effects" a year later at the 4th annual [[Arkie Awards]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= February 1983 |title= Arcade Alley: The Fourth Annual Arcade Awards |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 11|pages= 30, 108|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|108}}
