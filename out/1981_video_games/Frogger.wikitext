{{nihongo foot|'''''Frogger'''''|フロッガー|Furoggā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1981 [[arcade video game|arcade]] [[action game]] developed by [[Konami]] and published by [[Sega]].<ref name="GM172">{{cite magazine|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19810901p.pdf#page=11|title=Page for Overseas Readers - Sega of Japan got all rights of "Frogger" from Konami|magazine=Game Machine|issue=172|publisher=Amusement Press, Inc.|format=PDF|date=1 September 1981|page=20|access-date=2019-12-17|lang=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201074752/https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19810901p.pdf|archive-date=1 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In North America, it was distributed by [[Gremlin Industries|Sega/Gremlin]]. The object of the game is to direct five [[frog]]s to their homes by dodging traffic on a busy road, then crossing a river by jumping on floating logs and alligators.

''Frogger'' was positively received as one of [[List of video games considered the best|the greatest video games ever made]]. It was followed by numerous clones and several home-only sequels in the ''[[Frogger (series)|Frogger]]'' series. The 1982 [[Atari 2600]] version from [[Parker Brothers]] sold 4 million cartridges, making it one of the [[List of best-selling Atari 2600 video games|best-selling Atari 2600 games]]. By 2005, 20 million copies of its various home video game incarnations had been sold worldwide.

==Gameplay==
The objective of the game is to guide a frog to each of the empty homes at the top of the screen. The game starts with three, five, or seven frogs, depending on the machine's settings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frogger DIP Switch Settings|url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/dipswitch-settings/7857.html|website=International Arcade Museum}}</ref> Losing all frogs is [[game over]]. The player uses the 4-direction [[joystick]] to hop the frog once. ''Frogger'' is either single-player or two players alternating turns.

[[File:Frogger game arcade.png|thumb|left|Four frog homes at the top of the screen are filled. A fly is in the center one, which can be jumped on for 200 points.]]

The frog starts at the bottom of the screen, which contains a horizontal road occupied by speeding vehicles such as race cars, dune buggies, trucks, and bulldozers. The player must guide the frog between opposing lanes of traffic to avoid becoming roadkill and losing a life. After crossing the road, a [[median strip]] separates the two major parts of the screen. The upper half consists of a river with logs, alligators, and turtles, all moving horizontally across the screen in opposite directions. By jumping on swiftly moving logs and the backs of alligators and turtles, the player can guide the frog to safety. The player must avoid snakes, otters, and the open mouths of alligators. A brightly colored female frog is sometimes on a log and may be carried for bonus points. The very top of the screen contains five "frog homes", and at least one is always open and available. These sometimes contain bonus insects or deadly alligators.

When all five frogs are in their homes, the game progresses to the next level with increased difficulty. After five levels, the difficulty briefly eases and yet again progressively increases after each level. The timer gives 30 seconds to guide each frog into one of the homes, and resets back to 60 ticks whenever a life is lost or a frog reaches home safely.

In 1982, ''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' stated that "''Frogger'' has earned the ominous distinction of being 'the arcade game with the most ways to die'."<ref name="softline198211">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&pub=6&id=8 | title=Frogger | work=Softline | date=November 1982 | access-date=27 July 2014 | author=Rose, Gary and Marcia | pages=19}}</ref> There are many different ways to lose a life (illustrated by a [[skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]] symbol where the frog was), including being run over by a road vehicle; jumping into the river; running into snakes, otters, or an alligator's jaws; sinking while on top of a diving turtle; riding a log, alligator, or turtle off the side of the screen; jumping into a home already occupied by a frog or alligator; jumping into the side of a home or the bush; or running out of time.

The opening tune is the first verse of a Japanese children's song called "Inu No Omawarisan" ("The Dog Policeman"). Other Japanese tunes include the themes to the [[anime]] series ''[[Hana no Ko Lunlun]]'' and ''[[Rascal the Raccoon]]''. The American release has the same opening song plus "[[Yankee Doodle]]".

===Scoring===
Every forward step scores ten points, and every frog arriving safely home scores 50 points. Ten points are also awarded per each unused ½ second of time. Guiding a lady frog home or eating a fly scores 200 points each, and when all five frogs reach home to end the level the player earns 1,000 points. A single bonus frog is given at 20,000 points. 99,990 points is the maximum high score that can be achieved on an original [[arcade cabinet]]. Players may exceed this score, but the game "rolls over" and only keeps the last 5 digits.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Classic Arcade Games For Sale {{!}} ArcadeClassics.net|url=http://arcadeclassics.net/|website=arcadeclassics.net|language=en|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref>

==Release==
The game was developed by [[Konami]]. On July 22, 1981, [[Sega]] gained the exclusive rights to manufacture the game worldwide.<ref name="GM172"/>

===North America===
Sega/Gremlin was skeptical about ''Frogger''{{'}}s earning potential in North America. This was because no other company licensed the game. Also, an earlier game called ''[[Frogs (video game)|Frogs]]'' that was developed there had flopped. It was believed that ''[[Eliminator (1981 video game)|Eliminator]]'' would be the company's next big hit. Elizabeth Falconer, a market researcher at Sega/Gremlin, was tasked by Gremlin founder Frank Fogleman to check Gremlin's library of video presentations to see if there was anything worth licensing, and she stumbled across ''Frogger''.<ref name="Horowitz">{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games |date=22 June 2018 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-7225-0 |pages=36–42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xT1jDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36}}</ref>

Thinking the game deserved a chance though being "cute", she requested a licensing window for playtesting. She persuaded executives who denigrated ''Frogger'' as a "women and kids game" by reminding them of ''[[Pac-Man]]''. Sega/Gremlin agreed to pay Konami $3,500 per day for a 60-day licensing window. A prototype was playtested in a San Diego bar and was so successful that distributors agreed to resell the game based on the test alone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xT1jDwAAQBAJ&dq=frogger&pg=PA36|title=The Sega Arcade Revolution|pages=36–40|publisher=McFarland|date=2018-06-14|isbn=9781476672250 }}</ref>

''Frogger'' was [[porting|ported]] to many contemporary home systems. Several platforms such as the [[Commodore 64]] support both [[ROM cartridge]]s and [[magnetic storage|magnetic media]], so they received multiple versions of the game.<ref name="Moriarty198405">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_05_1984-05_Ion_International_US#page/n51/mode/2up | title=Frogger | work=Ahoy! | date=May 1984 | access-date=27 June 2014 | author=Moriarty, Tim | pages=52–53}}</ref>

[[Sierra On-Line]] gained the magnetic media rights and sublicensed them to developers who published for systems not normally supported by Sierra. Cornsoft published the official [[TRS-80]]/[[Dragon 32]], [[Timex Sinclair 1000]], and [[Timex Sinclair 2068]] ports. Because of that, even the [[Atari 2600]] received multiple releases: a standard cartridge and a cassette for the [[Starpath Supercharger]]. Sierra released disk or tape versions for the Commodore 64, [[Apple II]], [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]], IBM PC and Supercharger-equipped 2600, and cartridge versions for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]]

[[Parker Brothers]] received the license from Sega for cartridge versions which it released for the Atari 2600, [[Intellivision]], [[Atari 5200]], [[ColecoVision]], [[Atari 8-bit computers]], [[TI-99/4A]], [[VIC-20]] and [[Commodore 64]].

He said it was one of the "most exciting variations" on ''[[Pac-Man]]''{{'}}s [[Maze game|maze theme]] along with ''Donkey Kong'' due to how players need to "scale from the bottom of the screen to the top" which make them "more like obstacle courses than mazes" since "you always know where you're going—up."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bloom |first1=Steve |title=Video Invaders |date=1982 |publisher=Arco Publishing |isbn=978-0668055208 |pages=29, 42 |url=https://archive.org/details/book_video_invaders/page/n49}}</ref> Brett Alan Weiss of ''[[AllGame]]'' later reviewed the arcade game, calling it one of "the most beloved videogames ever created" and "pure, undiluted gaming at its finest".

Several clones retain the basic gameplay of ''Frogger'' and change the style or plot.

''[[Crossy Road]]'' (2014), for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, has a randomly generated series of road and river sections in one endless level, with only one life and a single point given for each forward hop.
