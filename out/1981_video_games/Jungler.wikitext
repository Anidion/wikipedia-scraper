'''''Jungler''''' is an arcade maze game developed by [[Konami]] and released in 1981. Distributed by [[Stern (game company)|Stern]] in the United States beginning in 1982,<ref name="arcade-history">{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=jungler&page=detail&id=1244|title=Jungler video game|work=ArcadeHistory.com|accessdate=2010-07-02}}</ref> the game has players controlling a multi-segmented creature attempting to destroy similar enemy creatures by either shooting them or eating them. A sequel titled '''''Battle Jungler''''' was planned for the [[PC Engine]] on 1992, but was cancelled.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Jungler arcade game - gameplay screenshot 1.png|thumb|left|The player controls the white creature. The others are enemies.]]
In ''Jungler'', the player controls a white, multi-segmented animal inside a blue maze. Also inside the maze are three enemy creatures similar to that of the player. The object of the game is to eliminate the enemy creatures before one of them eliminates the player. When all three enemies are defeated, the player advances to the next maze.

The enemy creatures appear in one of three colors: red, yellow or green. Red creatures are longer in length than the player, and as such a collision with the creature will cost the player one life. Yellow creatures are the same length as the player, thus posing no harm upon a collision. Green creatures are shorter than the player, and will be devoured by the player's creature if they collide. The player can shoot at the creatures, with each hit reducing the number of segments by one. As segments are removed, the creatures are able to move faster, thus making them harder to catch and eliminate.

Points are scored for shooting the creatures, as well as for collecting pieces of fruit that appear in the maze at random locations. These fruits will also add an extra segment to the player's creature.

==Ports==
The only contemporary home system ports of ''Jungler'' were by [[Emerson Radio Corporation|Emerson]] for the [[Tomy Tutor]] in 1981<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/tomy/carts.html|title=Tomy Tutor Cartridge, Software and Peripherals Catalogue|accessdate=2015-07-13}}</ref> and also for Emerson's [[Arcadia 2001]] console in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amigan.1emu.net/agg/|title=Arcadia 2001|work=Emerson Arcadia 2001 Game Guide|accessdate=2010-07-02}}</ref> [[Gakken]] made a tabletop handheld game of ''Jungler'' in 1982 as part of a series of flip-top games with [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] screen and magnifying [[Fresnel lens]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gakken Jungler |url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Gakken/Jungler.htm |website=Handheld Museum}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Much in the way that ''[[Space Panic]]'' remained obscure, but a home clone from [[Broderbund]] was a hit in the guise of ''[[Apple Panic]]'', the ''Jungler'' concept found success in a computer clone, also from Broderbund: ''[[Serpentine (video game)|Serpentine]]''. ''Squirm'' is a 1984 clone for the Commodore 64 by [[Mastertronic]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Squirm |url=http://gb64.com/game.php?id=7285&d=18&h=0 |website=Gamebase 64}}</ref>

==World record==
In May 1983, Joe Startz of [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]], [[Wisconsin]] set the ''Jungler'' world record with a score of 180,720 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&pi=2&gi=1632&vi=1310 |title=Jungler world record |work=TwinGalaxies.com |accessdate=2010-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527213231/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22 |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}</ref>
