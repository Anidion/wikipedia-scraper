==Reception==
Daniel Hockman reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that: "One of the best features of the game is the ability to list the day's stock quotes on a printer. This has two advantages over viewing the quotes on a CRT. First, you must flip through several "pages" of the daily report to see all the stocks on a CRT. Second, hard copy allows you to get a history on a stock."<ref name="CGW2">{{cite magazine |last=Hockman |first=Daniel |title=Micro - Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January–February 1982 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=28–29}}</ref>

Bob Proctor reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that: "I don't think this game is realistic -- IBM won't go bankrupt in 2 weeks and real tips are free and unreliable rather than expensive and 100% reliable -- but the player interaction makes ''Wall Street'' the most interesting stock market game yet."<ref name="CGW5">{{cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |title=We're in the Money...
