'''''Mini-MunchMan''''' is a [[handheld electronic game]] that was released in 1981 in the [[UK]] by the manufacturer [[Grandstand (game manufacturer)|Grandstand]].<ref name="minimunch">{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Grandstand/MiniMunch.htm |title=Grandstand Mini-Munchman |publisher=Handheldmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}</ref> The game is a rebadged version of ''Epoch-Man'' from [[Epoch Co.|Epoch]].<ref name="epoch">{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Epoch/EpochManPocket.htm |title=Epoch Epoch-Man (Pocket) |publisher=Handheldmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}</ref>

==Overview==
Capitalising on the then-contemporary success of ''[[Namco]]'''s ''[[Pac-Man]]'', the game was released in the same year as Grandstand's larger [[Munchman (tabletop electronic game)|Munchman]] game and in the same yellow colour scheme (Conversely, ''Epoch Man'' is white). Mini-Munchman, however, is a pocket-sized device that includes additional features, such as a real-time clock, alarm, and stopwatch. The manufacturer later spawned a larger LCD version with greater screen area called Pocket Pac-Man.<ref name="pocket">{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Grandstand/PacMan.htm |title=Grandstand Pocket Pac-Man |publisher=Handheldmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}</ref>

==Hardware==
The game employs a low consumption [[LCD]]-based screen, allowing for a small form factor design incorporating alkaline button power cells. The game requires two [[LR44 battery|LR-44]] or equivalent cells. In-game objects are displayed on fixed, immovable LCD elements. The main score display, which doubles up as a date/time and stopwatch display, consists of a three-and-a-half-digit display and an extra small digit for tenths of a second, or lives remaining.
==Gameplay==

The object of the game is to move the character around a maze, eat all the fruit, and avoid contact with ghosts. There are two humpback bridges containing fruit items over and underneath the bridge. Each successive level is faster, increasing difficulty. Each level has a fixed route the player can follow to ensure completion without losing a life. The game tracks the player's score, with a maximum possible score of 1,999. Once this has been exceeded, the score will display as '''HHH'''.
