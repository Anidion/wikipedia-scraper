==Gameplay==
[[File:Armored_Car.png|thumb|left|alt=An in-game screenshot showing the player driving through a city following signs towards the bank]] ''Armored Car'' is a maze game where the player must drive the titular armored car through a city from an top-down view which scrolls right to left. Some intersections are marked with directions that must be followed. The player can pick up money to deliver to banks while avoiding criminals by dropping [[sawhorse]]s in the road. Points are scored by number of city blocks travelled, picking up money, and blowing up robbers. Fuel levels need to be replenished at gas stations throughout the city.<ref name=gaminghis>{{cite web|url=https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=armored-car&page=detail&id=114|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230907080024/https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=armored-car&page=detail&id=114|archive-date= 7 September 2023|title=Armored Car|language=En|url-status=live|website=Gaming-History}}</ref> The player can speed up by pressing a button to shift the car into a higher gear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesdatabase.org/game/arcade/armored-car|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230907140349/https://www.gamesdatabase.org/game/arcade/armored-car|archive-date= 7 September 2023|title=Armored Car|language=En|url-status=live|website=Games Database}}</ref> Other vehicles appear as the player progresses through the game. The steam roller changes directional arrows to sawhorses. The street sweeper will sweep up sawhorses and directional arrows. The [[T.N.T.]] truck moves in a straight line from right to left, unless it views the armored car, where it will pursue the player in a straight line. If the truck crashes into a wall, the player gains 1000 bonus points.<ref name=gaminghis/>{{sfn|Stern Electronics|1981|pp=3}}
