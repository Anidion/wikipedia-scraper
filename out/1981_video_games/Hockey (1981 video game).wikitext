''Hockey'' is a sports game in which 2-4 players compete in an arcade-style game.<ref name="CGW7"/>

==Reception==
Bill Willett, writing for his "Atari Arcade" column in the June 1982 issue of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', called ''Hockey'' "a delight to play".<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Willett |first1=Bill |title=Atari Arcade |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=July 1982 |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=27 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_2.4/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_2.4/page/n27/mode/2up}}</ref> Later that year, also in CGW, Allen Doum stated: {{quote|The graphics are of the kind that leave [[George Plimpton]] flat. For those who like the arcade style sports games, these games fall short of what the computer is capable of. However, as two-player sports games, they can be exciting.<ref name="CGW7">{{cite magazine |last=Doum |first=Allen |title=Four for the Atari |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Nov–Dec 1982 |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=20}}</ref>}}

The reviewers in the 1983 book ''The Creative Atari'' called the game, "almost fast, never furious, and generally fun".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Creative Atari |date=1983 |publisher=Creative Computing Press |isbn=978-0916688349 |url=https://www.atariarchives.org/creativeatari/Gamma_Hockey.php}}</ref> The primary complaint was the slow movement speed of the players.

In ''[[Electronic Games]]'', Bill Kunkel wrote: {{Quote|In any case, Gamma's version misses the level of realism attained in Activision's programmable version for the VCS, by quite a bit. The players are drawn much too large for the cramped, on-screen rink. Due to the lack of space, the sport's primary characteristic, speed, is obliterated.<ref name=kunkel>{{cite journal |title=Computer Playland: Hockey |journal=Electronic Games |date=July 1982 |volume=1 |issue=5 |url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/magazines/electronic_games/electronic_games_jul82.pdf |pages=82–83 |last1=Kunkel |first1=Bill}}</ref>}}

He also disliked the minimal feedback when a goal is scored.<ref name=kunkel/>
