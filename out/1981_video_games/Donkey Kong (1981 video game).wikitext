{{Nihongo foot|'''''Donkey Kong'''''|ドンキーコング|Donkī Kongu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1981 [[arcade video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]]. As [[Mario]], the player runs and jumps on platforms and climbs ladders to ascend a construction site and rescue [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Pauline]] from a giant gorilla, [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]]. It is the first game in the ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' series and Mario's first appearance in a video game.

''Donkey Kong'' was created to salvage unsold [[arcade cabinet]]s following the failure of Nintendo's ''[[Radar Scope]]'' (1980), and was designed for [[Nintendo of America]]'s audience. [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]], Nintendo's president at the time, assigned the project to first-time [[video game design]]er [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Drawing inspiration from "[[Beauty and the Beast]]" and 1930s American media such as ''[[Popeye]]'' and ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', Miyamoto developed the characters and scenario and designed the game alongside chief engineer [[Gunpei Yokoi]]. It was the most complex arcade game at that point, using graphics for characterization, including it and [[cutscenes]] to illustrate a plot, and integrating multiple unique [[Stage (video game)|stages]] into the gameplay. ''Donkey Kong'' pioneered the [[platform game]] genre before the term existed, is the first to feature jumping, and is the first video game with a [[damsel in distress]] narrative. It had a limited release in Japan on July 9, 1981, before receiving a wide release some weeks later.

Although Nintendo of America's staff was initially apprehensive, ''Donkey Kong'' succeeded commercially and critically, becoming the highest-grossing game of 1981 and 1982. It was ported to the [[Game & Watch]], selling eight million units, while Nintendo licensed the game to [[Coleco]], a developer of arcade conversions for [[home consoles]], selling six million cartridges. It was later ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), designed to replicate its technological capabilities; both the game and NES were integral in spreading Japanese video games to Western audiences. ''Donkey Kong''<nowiki/>'s various ports sold more than 15 million units worldwide. Other companies [[Video game clone|cloned]] the game and avoided royalties altogether. [[Universal City Studios]] unsuccessfully sued Nintendo, alleging that ''Donkey Kong'' violated its trademark of the [[King Kong (franchise)|''King Kong'' franchise]].

''Donkey Kong''<nowiki/>'s success positioned Nintendo for market dominance for the 1980s and 1990s. The game debuts Mario, who became Nintendo's mascot and one of the world's most recognizable characters. It was mass marketed in multitudes of products, including breakfast cereal, toys, and television cartoons. ''Donkey Kong'' is one of the most important games from the [[golden age of arcade video games]] and one of the [[Greatest games of all time|greatest and most popular arcade games of all time]]. It has been frequently referenced in pop culture and subsequent video games and has an active [[Donkey Kong high score competition|high score competition]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Donkey Kong Gameplay.png|thumb|left|upright=1|The first stage, with [[Mario]] holding a [[hammer]] [[power-up]]]]

Following 1980's ''[[Space Panic]]'', ''Donkey Kong'' is one of the earliest examples of the [[platform game]] genre,<ref name="Chris Crawford" />{{rp|94}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Space Panic |url=https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=4724 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010101/https://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=4724 |archive-date=2014-01-01 |website=[[All Media Network#AllGame|AllGame]]}}</ref> even prior to the term being coined; the U.S. gaming press used "climbing game" for games with platforms and ladders.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=January 1983 |title=The Player's Guide to Climbing Games |url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134356/https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US |archive-date=March 19, 2016 |magazine=Electronic Games |page=49 |volume=1 |issue=11}}</ref> As the first platform game to feature jumping, ''Donkey Kong'' requires the player to jump between gaps and over obstacles or approaching enemies, setting the template for the future of the genre.<ref name="GamesRadar">{{Cite web |date=October 8, 2010 |title=Gaming's most important evolutions |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-3 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319151505/http://www.gamesradar.com/gamings-most-important-evolutions/ |archive-date=March 19, 2012 |access-date=April 11, 2011 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |page=3}}</ref> With four unique stages, ''Donkey Kong'' was the most complex arcade game of the time, and one of the first arcade games with multiple stages, following games such as 1980's ''[[Phoenix (1980 video game)|Phoenix]]'' and 1981's ''[[Gorf]]'' and ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]''.<ref name="Arcade Fever" />{{rp|66}}

In addition to the goal of saving [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Pauline]], the player has a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses; removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage according to a steadily decreasing bonus counter. The player starts with three lives with a [[Life (video games)#Extra lives|bonus life]] awarded at 7,000 points. A life is lost when Mario touches [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] or any enemy object, falls too far, or lets the bonus counter reach zero. The game ends when all lives are lost.

Each of the four single-screen stages represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed: 25, 50, 75, and 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong. Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of [[conveyor belt]]s, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The final stage requires Mario to remove eight rivets from the platforms supporting Donkey Kong; this causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero to be reunited with Pauline.<ref name="King of Kong" /> These four stages combine to form one level.

After each level, the stages repeat with increased difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs speed up. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The fourth level consists of five stages with the final stage at 125 meters. Level 130{{efn|Displayed in-game as level 22}} is colloquially known as the [[kill screen]], due to a programming error that kills Mario after a few seconds, effectively ending the game.<ref name="King of Kong" />

The player must take the role of Mario and rescue her.

The game uses graphics and animation for characterization. Donkey Kong smirks upon Mario's demise. Pauline has a pink dress and long hair,<ref name="Gender Inclusive" />{{rp|19–20}} and a speech balloon crying "HELP!". Mario, depicted in red overalls and a red cap, is an [[everyman]] character, a type common in Japan. Graphical limitations and the low pixel resolution of the small [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] prompted his design. A mustache implies a mouth,<ref name="Power-up" />{{rp|37}} a cap obviates the animation of hair, and colored overalls distinguish his arm movements.<ref name="High Score!" />{{rp|238}} The artwork of the cabinets and promotional materials make these cartoon-like character designs even more explicit.

The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage. He and Pauline are reunited, and a short intermission plays.<ref name="Power-up" />{{rp|40–42}}

==Development==
{{Further|Radar Scope}}
[[File:Donkey Kong arcade at the QuakeCon 2005.png|thumb|left|upright=1|Small model based on original arcade cabinet]]
[[Nintendo of America]] was founded in 1980 with minor success at importing its parent's arcade cabinets from Japan. In early 1981, its president [[Minoru Arakawa]] bet the small startup company on a major order of 3,000 ''[[Radar Scope]]''.<ref name="Game Over" />{{rp|103–105}}<ref name="History of SMB at IGN" /> Its poor reception in America filled a warehouse with 2,000 unsold ''Radar Scope'' machines, so Arakawa requested that the parent company president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] send a conversion kit of new game software. Yamauchi polled the company's entire talent pool for fresh game design concepts to save the distressed startup.<ref name="Game Over" />{{rp|106}}<ref name="History of SMB at IGN" /><ref name="Ultimate History" />{{rp|157}} This yielded [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]'s debut as lead game designer of his ''Donkey Kong'' concept, and Yamauchi appointed head engineer [[Gunpei Yokoi]] as project supervisor<ref name="Ultimate History" />{{rp|158}} with a budget of {{US$|267000|1981|long=no|round=-3}} according to Miyamoto.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=June 1992 |title=Unlikely Hero Creates Games and Profits |url=https://archive.org/details/Leisure_Line_1992-06_Leisure_Allied_Industries_AU/page/n24 |magazine=Leisure Line |publisher=Leisure & Allied Industries |location=Australia |pages=25–6}}</ref>

[[Ikegami Tsushinki]] was subcontracted for some of the development, with no role in the game's creation or concept, but to provide "mechanical programming assistance to fix the software created by Nintendo".<ref name="cch85">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVdsAAAAIAAJ |title=Copyright law decisions |publisher=[[CCH (Commerce Clearing House)|Commerce Clearing House]] |year=1985 |quote=An English translation of the Japanese term Donkey Kong is "crazy gorilla".

Individuals within the research and development department of Nintendo Co., Ltd., however, created the Donkey Kong concept and game. |access-date=February 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710030942/https://books.google.com/books?id=WVdsAAAAIAAJ |archive-date=July 10, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Fahs |first=Travis |date=2011-07-06 |title=The Secret History of Donkey Kong |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6422/the_secret_history_of_donkey_kong.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819101333/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6422/the_secret_history_of_donkey_kong.php |archive-date=2011-08-19 |access-date=2023-01-15 |website=[[Gamasutra]]}}</ref> Nintendo instructed Ikegami to produce a program according to its instructions and put it onto [[read-only memory]] (ROM) chips on [[printed circuit boards]] (PC boards). This later led to mutual lawsuits in 1983, as Ikegami asserted ownership over ''Donkey Kong'' which Nintendo denied as Ikegami was a subcontractor who had already been paid.

At the time, Nintendo was also pursuing a license to make a game based on the ''[[Popeye]]'' comic strip. When they experienced technical issues, Nintendo took the opportunity to create new characters that could be marketed and used in later games.<ref>[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]</ref> Miyamoto came up with many characters and plot concepts, but he settled on a love triangle between a gorilla, a plumber with a large hammer, and a girlfriend, mirroring the rivalry between [[Bluto]] and Popeye for [[Olive Oyl]].<ref name="Power-up" />{{rp|39}} Bluto became an ape, which Miyamoto said was "nothing too evil or repulsive".<ref name="Game Over" />{{rp|47}} He would be the pet of the main character, "a funny, hang-loose kind of guy".<ref name="Game Over" />{{rp|47}} Miyamoto has named "[[Beauty and the Beast]]" and the 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' as influences.<ref name="Power-up" />{{rp|36}} Although its origin as a comic strip license played a major part, ''Donkey Kong'' marked the first time that the storyline for a video game preceded the game's [[computer programming|programming]] rather than simply being appended as an afterthought.<ref name="Power-up" />{{rp|38}} An unrelated Popeye game was released by Nintendo for the [[Game & Watch]] the following month, as well as a game called ''[[Popeye (video game)|Popeye]]'' for arcades in 1982.

Yamauchi wanted primarily to target the North American market, so he mandated that the game be given an English title, as with many previous Nintendo games. Miyamoto decided to name the game for the ape, who he said was the strongest character.<ref name="Power-up" />{{rp|39}} The story of how Miyamoto came up with the name "Donkey Kong" varies. A false urban myth says that the name was originally meant to be "Monkey Kong", but was misspelled or misinterpreted due to a blurred fax or bad telephone connection.<ref name="Donkey Wrong" /> Another, more credible story claims Miyamoto looked in a Japanese-English dictionary for something that would mean "stubborn gorilla",<ref name="Ultimate History" />{{rp|158}} or that "Donkey" was meant to convey "silly" or "stubborn"; "Kong" was common Japanese slang for "gorilla".<ref name="High Score!" />{{rp|238}} A rival claim is that he worked with Nintendo's export manager to come up with the title, and that "Donkey" was meant to represent "stupid and goofy".<ref name="Game Over" />{{rp|48–49}} In 2001, Miyamoto stated that he thought the name would convey the thought of a "stupid ape".<ref name="miyamotoshrine">{{Cite web |title=Miyamoto Shrine: Shigeru Miyamoto's Home on The Web |url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/051601.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702082511/http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/051601.shtml |archive-date=July 2, 2007 |access-date=May 31, 2007 |website=Interview with Miyamoto (May 16, 2001, E3 Expo)}}</ref>

Miyamoto had high hopes for his new project. He was not a programmer, so instead consulted technicians for concept feasibility. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, and have different movements and reactions. Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too complex,<ref name="Game Over" />{{rp|47–48}} though he had some difficult suggestions, such as using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen which was eventually found too hard to program, though a similar concept came later in the ''Popeye'' arcade game. Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms, barrels, and ladders. When he specified that the game would have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to implement the game repeatedly.<ref name="Power-up" />{{rp|38–39}} Nevertheless, they followed Miyamoto's design, creating a total of approximately 20 [[Kibibyte|kilobytes]] of content.<ref name="Ultimate History" />{{rp|530}} Yukio Kaneoka composed a soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events.<ref name="famicom20th">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Famicom 20th Anniversary Original Sound Tracks Vol. 1 |url=http://vgmdb.net/album/404 |year=2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202033612/http://vgmdb.net/album/404 |publisher=Scitron Digital Contents Inc. |archive-date=December 2, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="music">{{Cite web |title=Donkey Kong |url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/music/music15.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312011921/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/music/music15.html |archive-date=March 12, 2008 |access-date=March 8, 2008 |website=Smash Bros.

The circuit board of ''Radar Scope'' was restructured for ''Donkey Kong''. The ''Radar Scope'' hardware, originally inspired by the [[Namco]] ''[[Namco Galaxian|Galaxian]]'' hardware, was designed for a large number of enemies moving around at high speeds, which ''Donkey Kong'' does not require, so the development team removed unnecessary functions and reduced the scale of the circuit board.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120505103737/http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/making-the-famicom-a-reality/ Making the Famicom a Reality], ''Nikkei Electronics'' (September 12, 1994) (translation by Nathan Altice)</ref> The gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chips, and the existing [[Central processing unit|CPU]], sound hardware, and monitor were left intact.<ref>Nathan Altice (2015), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GVDpCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA55 ''I Am Error: The Nintendo Family Computer / Entertainment System Platform'', page 55] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217204830/https://books.google.com/books?id=GVDpCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA55 |date=February 17, 2017}}, [[MIT Press]]</ref> The character set, scoreboard, upper HUD display, and font are almost identical to ''Radar Scope'', with palette differences.<ref>Nathan Altice (2015), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GVDpCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA362 ''I Am Error: The Nintendo Family Computer / Entertainment System Platform'', page 362] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217141022/https://books.google.com/books?id=GVDpCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA362 |date=February 17, 2017}}, [[MIT Press]]</ref> The ''Donkey Kong'' hardware has the memory capacity for displaying 128 foreground [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] at 16x16 [[pixel]]s each and 256 background [[Tile-based video game|tiles]] at 8x8 pixels each.

Hiroshi Yamauchi thought the game was going to sell well and phoned to inform Arakawa. Nintendo of America's distributors, Ron Judy and Al Stone, brought Arakawa to the lawyer [[Howard Lincoln]] to secure a trademark.<ref name="Ultimate History" />{{rp|159}}

The game was sent to Nintendo of America for testing. The sales manager disliked it for being too different from the [[maze game|maze]] and [[shooter game]]s common at the time,<ref name="Game Over" />{{rp|49}} and Judy and Lincoln expressed reservations over the strange title.

=== Coleco ===
Makers of [[video game console]]s were interested. [[Taito]] offered a considerable fee for all rights to ''Donkey Kong'', but Nintendo declined after three days of internal discussion.<ref name="Game Over" /> Rivals [[Coleco]] and [[Atari, Inc.]] approached Nintendo in Japan and the United States respectively. In the end, Yamauchi granted Coleco exclusive console and [[tabletop game|tabletop]] rights to ''Donkey Kong'' because he believed that "it [was] the hungriest company".<ref name="Game Over" />{{rp|111}} In addition, Arakawa believed that as a more established company in the U.S., Coleco could better handle marketing. In return, Nintendo received an undisclosed lump sum plus $1.40 per game cartridge sold and $1 per tabletop unit. On December 24, 1981, Howard Lincoln drafted the contract. He included language that Coleco would be held liable for anything on the game cartridge, an unusual clause for a licensing agreement.<ref name="Ultimate History" />{{rp|208–209}} Arakawa signed the document the next day, and, on February 1, 1982, Yamauchi persuaded the Coleco representative in Japan to sign without review by the company's lawyers.<ref name="Game Over" />{{rp|112}}

Coleco bundled the game with the [[ColecoVision]] console, which went on sale in August 1982, though the individual cartridge was also available in stores. Coleco offered [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]] versions as well.<ref name="arcexp">{{Cite magazine |date=August 30, 1982 |title=Coleco Rolls Videogame Line |url=https://archive.org/details/arcade_express_v1n2 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926002449/https://archive.org/details/arcade_express_v1n2 |archive-date=September 26, 2016 |magazine=Arcade Express |page=3 |volume=1 |issue=2}}</ref> Coleco's Atari 2600 port was programmed by [[Garry Kitchen]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 March 2014 |title=Garry Kitchen |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/profiles/developer/garry-kitchen/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210120174116/https://www.retrogamer.net/profiles/developer/garry-kitchen/ |archive-date=January 20, 2021 |access-date=19 April 2021 |website=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]]}}</ref><ref name=BeforeYouDie/>{{rp|35}} Kitchen was contracted to port the game through his brother Steve, who had connections to an executive at Coleco. He was given only three or four months to develop the port and worked without sleep for the last 72 hours before shipping.

When Coleco unveiled the [[Coleco Adam|Adam Computer]], running a port of ''Donkey Kong'' at the 1983 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in Chicago, Illinois, Atari protested that it was in violation of the licensing agreement.

''Donkey Kong'' was popular worldwide, garnering a positive reaction from consumers, and was a significant commercial success for Nintendo, pulling them out of financial troubles.

==Legacy==
In 1996 ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' listed the arcade, Atari 7800, and cancelled Coleco Adam versions as number 50 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time", commenting that even ignoring its massive historical significance, ''Donkey Kong'' stands as a great game due to its demanding challenges and graphics which manage to elegantly delineate an entire scenario on a single screen.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=September 1996 |title=Top 100 Games of All Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |page=52 |issue=21}}</ref> In February 2006, ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' rated it the 148th best game made on a Nintendo system.<ref name="Michaud2006">{{Cite magazine |last=Michaud |first=Pete |date=February 2006 |title=NP Top 200 |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |page=58 |volume=197}}</ref> In 2017, [[The Strong National Museum of Play]] inducted ''Donkey Kong'' to its [[World Video Game Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Donkey Kong |url=https://www.museumofplay.org/games/donkey-kong/ |access-date=6 May 2022 |website=[[The Strong National Museum of Play]] |publisher=[[The Strong]]}}</ref> Today, ''Donkey Kong'' is the fifth most popular arcade game among collectors.<ref name="Top Coin-op" />

===Impact===
''Donkey Kong'' spawned a number of other titles with a mix of running, jumping and vertical traversal, a novel genre that did not match the style of games that came before it.<ref name="i am error naming">{{Cite book |last=Altice |first=Nathan |title=I Am Error: The Nintendo Family Computer / Entertainment System Platform |date=2015 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=9780262028776 |pages=53–80 |chapter=Chapter 2: Ports}}</ref> The genre was initially referred to as "Donkey Kong-type" or "Kong-style" games,<ref name="CVG26" /><ref name="i am error naming" /> before the genre eventually came to be known as platform games.<ref name="i am error naming" /> The game was also a milestone in terms of video game storytelling and cutscenes. While there were earlier games that either told a story or used cutscenes, ''Donkey Kong'' combined both concepts together to introduce its own new concept: using cutscenes to visually advance a complete story.<ref name="Lebowitz" /> It also notably had multiple, distinct [[Level (video games)|levels]] that progressed the storyline.<ref name="RG">{{Cite news |date=13 September 2008 |title=Donkey Kong |url=https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/donkey-kong-4/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630133207/https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/donkey-kong-4/ |archive-date=June 30, 2021 |access-date=4 May 2021 |work=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing Limited]]}}</ref><ref name="Lebowitz" />

''Donkey Kong'' was also one of the first Japanese games brought to Western regions that introduced a surreal concept using cute artwork, a representation of typical Japanese fantasy but unusual to Western audiences. For that reason, ''Donkey Kong'' and similar games that followed were briefly called "novelty games" by Western gaming press. ''Donkey Kong'' and other such games helped to acclimate Western audiences to Japanese approaches to game design, narrative, and abstraction that would become key elements in the decade that followed with the release of the NES.<ref name="i am error naming" />

''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called ''Donkey Kong'' "the most momentous" release of 1981, as it "introduced three important names" to the global video game industry: Nintendo, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Mario. These three figures went on to play a significant role in video game history.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Glancey |first=Paul |date=1996 |title=The Complete History of Computer and Video Games |url=https://archive.org/details/book_complete_history_of_video_games/page/n13/mode/2up |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |pages=15–6}}</ref> ''Donkey Kong'' paved the way for the NES, known as the Famicom in Japan.

''[[Crazy Kong]]'' was officially licensed from Nintendo and manufactured by Falcon for some non-US markets.

Nintendo was quick to take legal action against those distributing the game in the US.<ref name="Court of Appeals, 1984" />{{rp|119}} [[Copyright infringement|Bootleg]] copies of ''Donkey Kong'' also appeared in both North America and France under the ''Crazy Kong'', ''Konkey Kong'' or ''Donkey King'' names.

Many [[home computer]] clones directly borrowed the gorilla theme: ''[[Killer Gorilla]]'' (BBC Micro, 1983), ''Killer Kong'' (ZX Spectrum, 1983), ''Crazy Kong 64'' (Commodore 64, 1983), ''Kongo Kong'' (Commodore 64, 1983), ''Donkey King'' (TRS-80 Color Computer, 1983), and ''Kong'' (TI-99/4A, 1983). One of the first releases from [[Electronic Arts]] was ''[[Hard Hat Mack]]'' (Apple II, 1983), a three-stage game without an ape, but using the construction site setting from ''Donkey Kong''. Other clones recast the game with different characters, such as ''[[Cannonball Blitz]]'' (Apple II, 1982), with a soldier and cannonballs replacing the ape and barrels, and the American Southwest-themed ''[[Canyon Climber]]'' (Atari 8-bit, 1982).<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnJU4fiiE2w |title=Canyon Climber |via=YouTube}}</ref>

===Franchise===
{{Main|Donkey Kong|l1 = ''Donkey Kong''}}{{refimprove section|date=July 2022}}
''Donkey Kong'' spawned a franchise, beginning with the sequel ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'' (1982) with the player controlling Donkey Kong's son in an attempt to save his father from Mario. The spin-off ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' (1983) introduced Mario's brother [[Luigi]] in a single-screen cooperative game, set in a sewer, and launched the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]]. The final arcade installment, ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' (1983), appeared in the form of a [[fixed shooter]], with an exterminator named Stanley ridding the ape—and insects—from a greenhouse.

Nintendo revived the franchise<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 21, 2022 |title=Celebrate Donkey Kong 30th Anniversary Google Doodle - Technopython |url=https://technopython.com/donkey-kong-30th-anniversary-google-doodle/}}</ref> in the 1990s for a series of platform games and spin-offs developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]], beginning with ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]]. ''[[Donkey Kong Racing]]'' for the GameCube was in development by Rare, but was canceled when [[Microsoft]] purchased the company. The ''Donkey Kong Country'' series was revived by [[Retro Studios]] in 2010 with the release of ''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]'', and its sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze]]'', in 2014.

In 2004, Nintendo released ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong]]'', a sequel to the Game Boy's ''Donkey Kong'', in which Mario must chase Donkey Kong to get back the stolen Mini-Mario toys; ''Mario vs. Donkey Kong'' has since continued as its own series. In 2004, Nintendo released the first of the ''[[Donkey Konga]]'' games, a rhythm-based game series that uses a special bongo controller. ''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]'' ([[2005 in video gaming|2005]]) is a unique platform action game that uses the same bongo controller accessory. In 2007, ''[[Donkey Kong Barrel Blast]]'' was released for the Wii. It was originally developed as a GameCube game and would have used the bongo controller, but was delayed and released exclusively as a Wii game with no support for the bongo accessory.

''Donkey Kong'' appears as a game in the Wii U game ''[[NES Remix]]'', which features multiple NES games and sometimes "remixes" them by presenting significantly modified versions of the games as challenges. One such challenge features Link from ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' traveling through the first screen to save Pauline. The difficulty is increased compared to the original ''Donkey Kong'' because Link cannot jump, as in ''Zelda''. ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]'' include a demo of the NES version of ''Donkey Kong''. A stage called "75m", a replica of its Donkey Kong namesake, has appeared in the ''Smash'' series since ''Brawl''.<ref name="DK Smash stage">{{Cite web |title=Smash Bros.

===In popular culture===
By June 1982, ''Donkey Kong''{{'}}s success had prompted more than 50 parties in the U.S. and Japan to license the game's characters.<ref name="Ultimate History" />{{rp|215}} Mario and Donkey Kong appeared on cereal boxes, [[Board game|board games]], [[pajamas]], and [[manga]]. In 1983, the animation studio [[Ruby-Spears Productions|Ruby-Spears]] produced a ''Donkey Kong'' cartoon (as well as ''Donkey Kong Jr.'') for the ''[[Saturday Supercade]]'' program on CBS. In the show, mystery crime-solving plots in the mode of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' are framed around the premise of Mario and Pauline chasing Donkey Kong (voiced by [[Soupy Sales]]), who has escaped from the circus. The show lasted two seasons.

The game has also been referenced and discussed in several films and documentaries. The 2007 documentary ''[[The King of Kong]]'' follows the efforts of [[Steve Wiebe]] and [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]] to break the world record for high scores in ''Donkey Kong''.<ref name="BeforeYouDie">{{Cite book |last=Carroll |first=Martin |title=100 Nintendo Games to Play Before You Die – Nintendo Consoles Edition |date=2021 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Darran |edition=3rd |chapter=Coin-op Capers: Donkey Kong}}</ref>{{rp|31}} The documentary inspired [[Hank Chien]] to start playing the game for fun; he became the new world champion on February 26, 2010.<ref name="BeforeYouDie" />{{rp|32}} The game's creation and lawsuit with Universal were discussed in the second episode of ''[[High Score (TV series)|High Score]]'' on [[Netflix]], which also featured an interview with John Kirby (who the episode was dedicated to as he died shortly before its release).

In the 2015 film ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]'', a film where aliens take on the form of 1980s arcade characters as they attack Earth, the alien leader takes on the form of Donkey Kong in the film's climax. In the 2023 ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Movie|Super Mario Bros. Movie]]'', Charles Martinet (Mario's voice actor in the video games), makes a cameo appearance as Giuseppe, who resembles how Mario looked back in ''Donkey Kong''. Giuseppe is also seen playing ''Donkey Kong'' on an arcade cabinet, but in the film the game is called "Jump Man", referencing Mario's original name.

In 1982, the songs "[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Do the Donkey Kong]]" by [[Buckner & Garcia]] and "Donkey Kong" by R. Cade and the Video Victims were released. Artists like [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince]] and [[Trace Adkins]] referenced the game in songs. Episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Crank Yankers]]'', and ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' have referenced the game. Sound effects from the Atari 2600 version serve as generic video game sounds in films and television series. The phrase "It's on like Donkey Kong" was coined by American rapper [[Ice Cube]] in 1992,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hartlaub |first=Peter |date=January 6, 2011 |title="It's on like Donkey Kong": A comprehensive history |url=https://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2011/01/06/its-on-like-donkey-kong-a-comprehensive-history/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414111919/http://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2011/01/06/its-on-like-donkey-kong-a-comprehensive-history/ |archive-date=April 14, 2015 |access-date=8 June 2021 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref> and has been used in various works of popular culture. In November 2010, Nintendo applied for a trademark on the phrase with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].<ref name="Gross2010">{{Cite news |last=Gross |first=Doug |date=November 10, 2010 |title=Nintendo seeks to trademark 'On like Donkey Kong' |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/gaming.gadgets/11/10/on.like.donkey.kong/index.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022200616/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/gaming.gadgets/11/10/on.like.donkey.kong/index.html |archive-date=October 22, 2012 |access-date=November 10, 2010 |publisher=CNN}}</ref>
