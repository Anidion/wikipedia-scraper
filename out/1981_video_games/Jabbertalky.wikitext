Ron Boerger reviewed ''Jabbertalky'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 48.<ref name="SG">{{cite magazine |last=Boerger |first=Ron |date=February 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews |url=https://archive.org/details/Space_Gamer_48/page/36/mode/2up?view=theater |magazine=[[The Space Gamer]] |publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]] |issue=48 |pages=36 |access-date=June 1, 2023}}</ref> Boerger commented: "Unless you are (a) crazy about word games, (b) want to buy every game for the Apple, or (c) both of the above, don't waste your money on this one."<ref name="SG"/>

Marty Halpern reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "once you understand how the game functions, it really is quite simple. By the way, I've not revealed all of the Jabbertalker's secrets... these you must discover on your own. So, while I try to find Alice, why don't you just uncurl your cramped fingers from about that joystick, forget about the aliens or hidden treasure for a little while, and enter the world of the Jabbertalker."<ref name="CGW4">{{cite magazine |last=Halpern |first=Marty |date=May–June 1982 |title="To scroll across the monitor of life..."
