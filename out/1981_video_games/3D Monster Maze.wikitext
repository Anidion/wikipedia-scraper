'''''3D Monster Maze''''' is a [[survival horror]] [[computer game]] developed from an idea by J.K. Greye and programmed by [[Malcolm Evans (computer programmer)|Malcolm Evans]] and released in [[1981 in video games|1981]]<ref name="YourComputer02x01"/> for the [[Sinclair ZX81]] platform with the 16&nbsp;KB memory expansion. The game was initially released by [[J. K. Greye Software]] in December&nbsp;[[1981 in video gaming|1981]] and re-released in 1982 by Evans' own [[startup company|startup]], [[New Generation Software]]. Rendered using [[image resolution|low-resolution]] character block "graphics", it was one of the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] games for a [[home computer]],<ref>{{cite news | title=The Wonderful Computers of Clive Sinclair| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A821648| date=2002-09-17| access-date=2008-05-21}} A look at Sir Clive Sinclair's computers.</ref> and one of the first games incorporating typical elements of the genre that would later be termed [[survival horror]].

''3D Monster Maze'' puts the player in a [[maze]] with one exit and a hostile monster, the ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''. There, the player must traverse the maze, from the [[first person (video games)|first-person perspective]], and escape through the exit without being eaten.

J.K.Greye Software went on to become a very successful games company, publishing six Game Tapes<!--Is there any specific reason for these two words having capitalised first letters?--> for the Sinclair ZX81; two use 3D graphics: 3D Monster Maze and 3D Defender, both designed by J.K.Greye and programmed by Malcolm Evans.

New Generation Software went on to become a well-known [[software]] firm with the [[Sinclair Research Ltd|Sinclair]] platform and continued to pioneer the 3D gaming technology for ZX81 and the later model [[ZX Spectrum]]. The press immediately gave the game a title of a "firm favourite" of the ZX81 users. Decades later, it became popular with the [[retrogaming]] community, inspiring [[Video game remake|remake]]s and fuelling ZX81 [[emulator|emulation]] projects.<ref>{{cite web | title=vb81| author=Chris Cowley <ccowley@grok.co.uk>| work=vb81 — Sinclair ZX81 Emulator | url=http://freestuff.grok.co.uk/vb81/ | year=2002 | access-date=2008-03-30| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420165413/http://freestuff.grok.co.uk/vb81/| archive-date= 20 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}} A ZX81 [[emulator]] packaged with ''3D Monster Maze'' and other famous games; licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] (but written in [[Visual Basic (classic)|Visual Basic]]).

==Gameplay==

The game uses an 18-by-16 cell maze which is [[randomness|randomly]] generated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://softtangouk.wixsite.com/soft-tango-uk/3d-monster-maze|title=soft-tango-uk|website=wixsite.com|access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref><ref name="e161">{{cite magazine| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513045033/http://www.edge-online.co.uk/archives/2006/04/the_making_of_3_1.php| archive-date=2007-05-13 | url=http://www.edge-online.co.uk/archives/2006/04/the_making_of_3_1.php | author=''Edge'' staff (Andy Krouwel)|title=The Making of...

Once the player starts moving, the beast begins hunting. Thereafter, the ''T.&nbsp;rex'' may either calm down (if the player goes into a part of the maze that is far enough away), or become more active as the player comes closer. If the ''T.&nbsp;rex'' gets a direct view of its prey, the monster will run directly at the player.<ref name="e161" />

The ''T.&nbsp;rex'' anxiety level, reported to the player as a statement in the status line, provides an indirect clue to the player's relative distance from the monster. These statements are: ''REX LIES IN WAIT'', followed by ''HE IS HUNTING FOR YOU'', ''FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING'', ''REX HAS SEEN YOU'', and '''''RUN''' HE IS BESIDE YOU'' or '''''RUN''' HE IS BEHIND YOU''. The player's speed is greater than the monster's, thus it is possible to escape by running (unless the player is trapped in a dead end).<ref name="zx81-stuff">{{cite web | title=3D Monster Maze Instructions| url=http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/info.php?path=/zx81&sub=inlays&root=3DMonsterMaze&file=.Instructions.jpg| year=1981| access-date=2008-06-12}} Scan of ''3D Monster Maze'' instructions.</ref> The player can manually map the maze on a piece of paper with each step, but this becomes increasingly difficult as the pace increases. The fast pace can also lead to hard keyboard presses, which, in turn, can shake the computer/16K memory expansion connection, and lead to a sudden reset with several minutes worth reload time.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sinclair ZX80, ZX81 and Spectrum| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A82162| date=1999-06-01| access-date=2008-06-12}} A look at Sir Clive Sinclair's computers.</ref>

[[Score (gaming)|Points]] are awarded for each step made by the player any time the dinosaur is on an active hunt. Since the player runs faster than the monster, it is possible to accumulate points by running around in circles with the monster just a few steps behind. Points are also given upon successfully getting away through an exit and into another maze.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Home Computer Games: Four Great Games For The Timex Sinclair 1000| journal=[[Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games]]| date=Fall 1983| author=David Grosjean| volume=1|issue=2| url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n2/timexgames.php|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110628230759/http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n2/timexgames.php |archive-date = June 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

When the game ends, the player is informed about being "[[sentence (law)|sentenced]] to roam the maze forever", and then can either "appeal" or continue playing again in the last maze. If the appeal is attempted, it is rejected with 50% [[probability]], in which case the player is sent back to roam the previous maze again. An appeal which is accepted effectively results in the computer [[Reboot (computing)|self-reset]] via BASIC's <code>NEW</code> [[statement (programming)|statement]].<ref name="e161" />

==Technology==
[[File:ZX81.chars.00-0A.80-8A.png|thumbnail|169px|left|The 22 [[Semigraphics|pseudo-graphics]] characters used as the building blocks of the 3D picture.]]
The graphical view, animated in real time at around 6&nbsp;[[frame rate|frames per second]], is composed of 8×8 [[pixel]] black-and-white characters, so the view is roughly square, taking a 25×24 area on the 32×24 text screen. Sub-character resolution of the [[Sinclair ZX81#General description|ZX81]] pseudo-graphics character set makes the resolution doubled in each dimension (making the view consist of 50×48 "larger pixels"). Using the 6&nbsp;pseudo-graphics with a [[dithering]] pattern also made it possible for the game author to incorporate a third colour (grey) in the black-and-white picture. Part of the screen is reserved for the score count, and a one-line status message is occasionally overlaid at the bottom of the graphical view. The player always runs along the corridor's centreline, and looks in the current direction only, which simplifies the rendering task.

[[File:3D-monster-maze-T-rex-2-steps-away.png|thumbnail|304px|Screenshot from ''3D Monster Maze''. The monster, a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', is two steps away.]]
The [[game engine|game's 3D engine]] and the random [[maze]] creation code is written in [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] [[machine code]], produced with an [[assembler (computer programming)|assembler]].<ref name="e161" /> This is augmented by several dozen [[Sinclair BASIC|BASIC]] lines for less critical tasks, such as the initial greetings and the game legend animation inter-line delay. The machine code [[subroutine]]s block is embedded into the BASIC line&nbsp;0, beginning with a <code>REM</code> (BASIC [[comment (computer programming)|comment]]) statement, making the [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] step over it. If, by accident, one tries to edit the line via the BASIC [[line editor]], the changes will not be accepted since 0 is an invalid line number. Such code is typically created by first creating a line with a valid number, and then modifying the number field in the BASIC program area using direct memory manipulation, such as <code>[[PEEK and POKE|POKE]]</code>.<ref>{{cite web | title=A Guide To POKEing on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum| url=http://www.neoncherry.com/retrorepairshack/readarticle.php?article_id=9| work=The Retro Repair Shack| date=2007-03-22| access-date=2008-07-15}} An article describing how LINE 0 works on Sinclair computers.</ref> No [[copy protection]] is embedded into the game; moreover, the [[Compact Cassette (data)|magnetic tapes]] of the time being unreliable, one could reuse the save entry point in the BASIC code (that was used by the original developers to have the game auto-run upon being loaded by the user) in order to save another program copy to the tape (for archival and [[backup]] purposes).

The game is controlled by three of the keyboard [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] control keys (left, forward and right, respectively 5, 7 and 8 on the ZX81 keyboard). The game speed can also be controlled{{snd}} according to the original cassette inlay, the BASIC line&nbsp;370 has a [[hardwired control|hardwired]] [[constant (computer science)|constant]] determining a [[busy waiting]] loop delay. The constant initially is set to&nbsp;5; by varying it from&nbsp;0&nbsp;to&nbsp;9 the game can be adjusted from faster to slower tempo.<ref name="zx81-stuff" /> The 6&nbsp;frame per second figure corresponds to the delay set to zero, while holding the "forward" key to run straight. A somewhat jerky motion is perceived at this slow framerate which gives a feeling of being jerked along with each step of a desperate heavy run.

''3D Monster Maze'' was the first game programmed by Malcolm Evans based on a design by J.K.Greye.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hit Squad — Not just a load of old rubbish |journal=Sinclair User |date=September 1984 |author=Chris Bourne |issue=30|url=http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/030/htsquad.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010309055803/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/030/htsquad.htm |archive-date=2001-03-09 }} Featuring Malcolm Evans following the ''Trashman'' hit game.</ref> He worked in the aerospace industry, first in aircraft design, and then as a microprocessor scientist at [[Sperry Gyroscope Company|Sperry Gyroscope]] in [[Bristol]], [[United Kingdom]]. He received a ZX81 from his wife for his thirty-seventh birthday in April&nbsp;1981. Malcolm developed basic aspects of the game to test what the computer was capable of, and completed it after adding design features suggested by J.K.Greye, including adding the T.Rex and turning the Maze into a game. Friends persuaded Malcolm that the game was of high enough quality to sell and it was eventually released by J.K.&nbsp;Greye Software in late 1981.<ref name="crash05">{{cite journal|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/05/newgen.htm| author=''CRASH'' staff (Michael Broomfield)| title=''New Generation'' Ingredients of a winning team| journal=[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]|issue=5|date=June 1984}} An article about ''New Generation Software'', the firm that was started with the ''3D Monster Maze'' development.</ref>

When soon after that the Bristol branch of Sperry Gyroscope closed, Malcolm made a decision to concentrate fully on computer gaming. The firm New Generation Software he had founded kept producing 3D games for the Sinclair Research computers, and became synonymous with 3D gaming on this platform for some time.<ref name="su18">{{cite journal|title=3D Games|journal=[[Sinclair User]]|author=John Gilbert| date=September 1983|issue=18| url=http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/018/3dgames.htm| access-date=2004-11-01| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103172529/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/018/3dgames.htm| archive-date=2004-11-03| url-status=dead}} Discussion of the 3D gaming scene on the Sinclair computers, naturally opened by ''3D Monster Maze''.</ref> Some of his games were hailed by the gaming scene, but some titles occasionally drew criticism from reviewers for their fancy graphics but poor game plot.

==Reception==
{{cleanup rewrite|section=yes|date=November 2019}}

The game was sold domestically in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and overseas, and became a hit shortly after it was released:
{{blockquote|... when the ZX81 had just been launched, software standards were generally pretty low. One exception to this rule was a program called 3D Monster Maze, which has been a firm favourite with ZX81 owners since it first appeared ...<ref>{{cite journal | title=Writing for the new generation| journal=[[Home Computing Weekly]]| date=1983-10-18| issue=33| page=43| url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=HomeComputingWeekly/Issue033/Pages/HomeComputingWeekly03300043.jpg | access-date=2009-05-24}}</ref>}}

Contemporary reviews described it as "the best game I have seen for the Sinclair ZX81"<ref>{{cite journal | journal=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=April 1983 | issue=6 | page=77 | title=Software reviews: 3D Monster Maze | url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue006/Pages/CVG00600077.jpg | access-date=2008-12-07}}</ref> and "Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! Straight away this gets into my personal top ten ZX Programs ... Undoubtedly one of the best ZX programs available.".<ref>{{cite journal | journal=[[Popular Computing Weekly]] | date=1983-05-13 | issue=820513 | page=10 | title=Reviews - Software: Monster Maze | url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=PopularComputingWeekly/Issue820513/Pages/PopularComputingWeekly82051300010.jpg| access-date=2008-12-07}}</ref>

Even though it did not use the undocumented [[high resolution|hi-res]] graphics feature of the ZX81, and rendered the scene with pseudo-graphics characters (available in the standard ZX81 [[character set]]), the game was considered to be a remarkable achievement, utilising the machine's capabilities to its best:
{{blockquote|If I had to choose just one programme to impress an audience with the capabilities of the ZX81, then 3D Monster Maze would be the one without a doubt.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=[[ZX Computing]] | date=December 1983| issue=December/January 1984| page=163| title=3D Monster Maze| url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ZXComputing/Issue8312/Pages/ZXComputing831200163.jpg | access-date=2008-12-07}}</ref>}}

Soon the Sinclair platform users began switching over to the newer ZX Spectrum, which had better graphics resolution and colour, bigger<!--Bigger? Shouldn't that be "more"?--> [[Random access memory|RAM]] and [[Read only memory|ROM]], as well as sound capability and a sleeker look and feel. Some people still continued to use their ZX81, and even the Spectrum users gave credit to ''3D Monster Maze'' as the game that brought the 3D aspect into the home computer gaming:
{{blockquote|Even those critics who dismissed the ZX-81 as a child's toy, had to admit that the program was innovative and well-presented. Monster Maze marked the rise of the use of 3D techniques on microcomputers as small as the ZX-81 and Spectrum.<ref name="su18" />}}

The success of Monster Maze brought recognition to Malcolm Evans and his company, New Generation Software. As a result, they continued to release more games that further improved the 3D gaming experience. Even when later hit games by N.G.S., such as ''[[Trashman (computer game)|Trashman]]'', were covered by the gaming media reviews, ''3D Monster Maze'' was remembered as the landmark impressive start:
{{blockquote|From the outset New Generation and Malcolm Evans have become synonymous with 3D graphics ...<ref name="crash05" />}}

''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' in 2006 stated that ''3D Monster Maze'' "is the original [[survival horror]] game", writing "Ask any player and they'll tell you what 3D Monster Maze was chiefly about: fear, panic, terror and facing an implacable, relentless foe who's going to get you in the end."{{r|e161}} ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' agreed, in 2014 stating that "Survival horror may have been a phrase first coined by Resident Evil, but it could've easily applied to Malcolm Evans' massive hit."<ref name="rg20140203">{{cite news | url=http://www.retrogamer.net/top_10/top-ten-zx-81-games/ | title=Top Ten ZX 81 Games | work=Retro Gamer | date=2014-02-03 | access-date=21 January 2015 | author=Retro Gamer Team}}</ref> With ZX81 games played mostly in emulated environments by the [[retrogaming]] community, it still receives enthusiastic reviews, even while modern high-end [[gaming console]]s and home computers provide much richer capabilities for one's [[immersion (telepresence)|immersion]] into a first-person 3D game:
{{blockquote|Best of the old games we played this month... The best thing about 3DMM was strangely the silence as you moved around. ... This added to the atmosphere. This also added to the scares. There was nothing worse than heading down a corridor and in the distance seeing the start of the dino heading towards you. Because the graphics were slow to draw the dino came at you in a few steps. Turning around and sprinting the other way was a manic dance across the keyboard, while you looked stunned as the screen filled with teeth.
