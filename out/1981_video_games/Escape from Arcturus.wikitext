==Reception==
Bob Boyd reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "The high score for each mode is saved on disk which is a nice feature. The graphics are good in the "Fortress" mode and outstanding in the "Escape" mode. As current arcade games go, however, ''Escape from Arcturus'' tends to be a little simplistic."<ref name="CGW2">{{cite magazine |last=Boyd |first=Bob |title=Micro - Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=Januaryâ€“February 1982 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=31}}</ref>
