'''''Milestones''''' is a 1981 video game published by ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]]'' for the [[Apple II]].

==Description==
''Milestones'' is a computer auto race card game similar to ''[[Touring (card game)|Touring]]''.<ref name="SG"/> The players receive cards that contain events occurring during a car race. Some of these move the player forward towards the 1000 mile point, and the general goal is to play enough of these to cross the line first. Other cards are hazards that can be played against the opponent, or solutions to those hazards. For instance, a hazard might be a flat tire card, while the remedy is a spare tire card. Normally played by two or more players, in ''Milestones'' the computer can play the other hands.

==Reception==
Forrest Johnson reviewed ''Milestones'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 40.<ref name="SG">{{cite journal|last=Johnson |first=Forrest |date=June 1981 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=40|pages=35}}</ref> Johnson commented that "''Milestones'' is not for the average wargamer - strategy can be optimized much too easily. Still, it is a good game for people who enjoy solitaire."<ref name="SG"/>
