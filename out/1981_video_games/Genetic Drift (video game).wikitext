==Gameplay==
''Genetic Drift'' is a game in which the player changes hostile mutants into friendly life forms.<ref name="CGW2"/>

==Reception==
Bob Boyd reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "This is not a game for the pondering thoughtful player. I would recommend this game to arcade addicts only. The game can become extremely angering especially when you've got all but one form turned into a TV set and while waiting for it to come back into range you notice the heart peacefully drifting toward you from the rear is '''upside down'''."<ref name="CGW2">{{cite magazine |last=Boyd |first=Bob |title=Micro - Reviews |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January–February 1982 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=27–28}}</ref>

==Development==
Scott Schram quit his job to write the game for the Apple II. He spent several weeks developing ''Photon Base'', which Broderbund retitled ''Genetic Drift''.<ref name=schram/>
