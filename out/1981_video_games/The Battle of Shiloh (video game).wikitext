==Gameplay==
''The Battle of Shiloh'' is a game in which the player can reenact the [[Battle of Shiloh]].<ref name="CGW2"/> Playing either against the computer or another player, players employ infantry and artilary units to compete for control of the [[Pittsburg Landing]].<ref name="antic">{{Cite magazine |last=Fox |first=Robert |date=September 1985 |title=8-Bit Product Reviews: Star SR-10 printer, Trivia Quest, Bank Street Music Writer, Kampfgruppe, Guidebook for Winning Adventurers, Dr. Wacko Presents Atari BASIC, The Home Computer Wars, Computer Title Bout, Battle of Shiloh, Broadsides, Alley Cat |url=https://www.atarimagazines.com/v4n5/productreviews.html |magazine=Antic |access-date=2023-07-08}}</ref> Although based on the historical battle, players can modify the strengths of the respective Confederate and Union armies, and the game takes into account the impact of terrain.<ref name="antic" /> Players can also modify the level of risk and strategy for both the defender and attacker, and as the original battle involved an element of surprise, the first four moves of the game are weighted towards the Confederates.<ref name="archibald" /><ref>"[https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_03_1982-05_Reese_Communications_US/page/n37/mode/2up?q=shiloh Computers Create the Electronic Battlefield]", (1982) ''Electronic Games''.

==Reception==
Bob Proctor reviewed the game for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and stated that "This is a very well designed product. Although it will take at least 2 hours to play the first day (and as much as 5 hours for both days), there are no periods of inactivity longer than 5 seconds or so. The game is absorbing; you are constantly making decisions and watching for weaknesses in the enemy."<ref name="CGW2">{{cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |title=The Battle of Shiloh |magazine=Computer Gaming World |date=January–February 1982 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=33–34}}</ref> The magazine in 1987 wrote that "Shiloh could have gone either way and the same delicate balance exists in this game".<ref name="cgw198711">{{cite magazine | title=Christmas Buyers Guide | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=November 1987 | pages=20 |url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_41/page/n19/mode/2up |issue=41}}</ref>

Robert Fox of ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' raised concerns regarding the lack of sound, the "murky" graphics, and the randomised outcomes of battles,<ref name="antic" /> but ROM Magazine found the graphics to be good,<ref name="rom" /> and commenting on the Apple II version of the game, reviewers Mike Shadick and Sallie Stephenson described the graphics on that platform as outstanding.<ref name="shadick" /> In regard to the computer player, Proctor criticised choices made to improve the game balance, as the computer was given extra mobility to make up for shortcomings in the AI, and concluded that it was a game better played against another person – a concern also reflected in Laurance Miller's review for ''Micro Adventurer''.<ref name="miller" /><ref name="CGW2" /> Similarly, ROM magazine felt that the computer moves were too slow, even though they appreciated the game's flexibility and the clear theme.<ref name="rom">"The Battle of Shiloh", (1983), ''ROM Magazine'', Issue 2, p14.</ref> Reviewing the game for ''The Minneapolis Star'', Dale Archibald found it easy to play and described it as a "thoughtful recreation of a battle that could have changed the course of this country's history".<ref name="archibald" />
