'''''Deflex''''', also known as '''''Made In France''''', is an [[action game]] developed by [[Jeff Minter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/06/27/jeff-minter-bounces-deflex-to-ios |title=Jeff Minter bounces 'Deflex' to iOS |website=Joystiq.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref> The versions for the [[VIC-20]] and [[Commodore PET]] in 1981 were the first games by Minter's own Llamasoft.<ref>{{cite web|last=Minter|first=Jeff|title=The origins of Deflex|url=http://stinkygoat.livejournal.com/211183.html#cutid1|accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The gameplay in all versions follows the same basic mechanic.  A ball bounces around the screen, moving in cardinal directions only and bouncing off at 180 degrees when it strikes the side of the screen.  By pressing a key (or moving the joystick or touching the touchscreen), the player can cause a paddle to appear at the ball's current location, making the ball immediately bounce off the paddle and turn either left or right.  Once placed, a paddle remains on screen, forcing the ball into more and more complex bouncing patterns.  In addition, whenever the ball strikes a paddle, the paddle's direction is reversed.  The objective of the game is to guide the ball to touch a randomly placed target that appears on screen.  When the target is touched, score is awarded and a new target is placed, although all existing paddles remain.  The player loses the game if a target is not touched within a time limit.

The original PET/VIC-20/ZX81 version displays one target at a time, and there is a single level which never ends.

==Ports==
The [[Commodore 64]] version of ''Deflex'' is called ''Made In France'' (because the programmer was actually in France at the time he programmed that part of the game) was posted as a free download to the [[Compunet]] service.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}  The gameplay is the same as the original version.  This was also included as an [[easter egg]] in the game ''Iridis Alpha'', where it identified itself only as "MIF BY YAK".

''Deflex'' for the [[Pocket PC]] was later released and ported to [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minotaurproject.co.uk/deflex.php |title=Deflex |website=Minotaurproject.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>  The game is divided into levels with each level having a pre-determined layout of multiple targets and sometimes pre-placed walls. The player muste collect all targets on the level within the time limit and number of lives. Hazardous objects instantly cost the player a life if the ball touches them, with the message "You clumsy donkey!"

The most recently released version is for [[iOS]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Purchese |first=Robert |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-06-28-jeff-minters-new-iphone-game-deflex |title=Jeff Minter's new iPhone game Deflex |website=Eurogamer.net |date=2011-06-28 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref> This follows the same level-based structure as the PocketPC version, but the time limit returns to being between collection of individual targets rather than for the whole level, and touching a hazardous object deducts an amount of time rather than instantly losing the level. Placing paddles also deducts a small amount of time. Any previously reached level can be replayed. The ball may be precisely placed to touch multiple targets at the same time; doing this multiple times in series awards additional points. The soundtrack is composed of piano chords and arpeggios triggered by events in the game and [[voice-over]] reminiscent of [[Fluttershy]] from [[My Little Pony]]. Llamasoft stopped supporting iOS, and all of its games were removed from the [[app store]].
