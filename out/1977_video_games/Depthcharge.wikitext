'''''Depthcharge''''' is a black-and-white [[arcade video game]] released in 1977 by [[Gremlin Industries]]. The game shows a side view of a section of ocean with a [[destroyer]] on the surface and [[submarines]] passing beneath it. The player-controlled destroyer can be moved left and right and drop [[depth charge]]s to destroy the submarines below.

==Gameplay==
Up to four submarines may be present at any given time, each of which bears a score for destroying it that increases with its depth. Submarines release mines which the player-controlled ship must avoid by moving out of their path.
