'''''DND''''' is a [[role-playing video game]]s developed by [[Purdue University]] student Daniel Lawrence in 1977 for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) [[PDP-10]] [[mainframe computer]]. The name ''DND'' is derived from the abbreviation "D&D" from the original [[tabletop role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. It was later ported to several other computer systems and languages. After Lawrence re-used code from the game in the 1982 role-playing game ''[[Telengard]]'', DEC ordered ''DND'' be removed from their computers to avoid litigation by ''Telengard''{{'}}s publisher. ''DND'' was one of the earliest role-playing video games, as part of a set of games developed in the 1970s based on the 1974 ''Dungeons & Dragons''.

==Development==
''DND'' was written in [[BASIC]] for the [[TOPS-10]] time-share operating system by Daniel Lawrence, a student at [[Purdue University]], for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[PDP-10]] [[mainframe computer]] and released around 1977.<ref name="DNDhistory">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070704062317/http://dnd.lunaticsworld.com/ dnd.lunaticsworld.com] (archived)</ref><ref>[http://crpgaddict.blogspot.de/2015/03/game-180-dnd-1984.html Game 180: DND (1984)] (March 18, 2015)</ref><ref name="DnD44">{{cite book |title=Dungeons and Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games |edition=2nd |last1=Barton |first1=Matt |last2=Stacks |first2=Shane |date=2019 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-138-57464-9 |page=44}}</ref> It was one of several freeware games based on ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' in the 1970s.<ref name="DnD44"/> Later the game found its way to [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] and was there rewritten in 1983 to [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/notes/jim-burrows/the-story-of-the-dnd-ban-at-dec/10150195644192850/ the-story-of-the-dnd-ban-at-dec] by jim-burrows</ref><ref>[http://www.digital-eel.com/files/dndpage_files/classic_mainframe_games.htm mainframe games] on digital eel</ref>
