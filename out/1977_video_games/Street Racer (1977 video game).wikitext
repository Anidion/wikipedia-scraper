'''''Street Racer''''' is a [[racing video game]] developed for the Atari Video Computer System, later known as the [[Atari 2600]]. It was programmed by [[Larry Kaplan]]<ref name="giantlist"/> and released by [[Atari, Inc.]] in September 1977 as one of the nine Atari VCS launch titles.<ref
name="AtariAgeLaunch"/><ref name="RacingTheBeam"/> The game was also published by [[Sears]] for their Tele-Games product line as '''''Speedway II'''''.<ref name="AAStreetRacer"/>

== Gameplay ==

''Street Racer'' was one of the two launch titles programmed by Kaplan; ''[[Air-Sea Battle]]'' was the other. ''Street Racer'' offered 27 game variations, grouped into the following sub-games:<ref name="AAStreetRacer" />
* '''1–6''': Street racer
* '''7–12''': Slalom
* '''13–16''': Dodgem
* '''17–20''': Jet shooter
* '''21–24''': Number cruncher
* '''25–27''': Scoop ball

Each of the sub-games has roughly the same gameplay: the player controls a vehicle that must avoid or collect certain objects as they scroll down the screen. Between one and four players can compete simultaneously by using the paddle controllers,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://atariage.com/manual_page.php?SystemID=2600&ItemTypeID=&SoftwareLabelID=513&currentPage=0&maxPages=12&currentPage=1 | title=AtariAge - Atari 2600 Manuals - Street Racer (Atari) }}</ref> which allow the vehicle to move left and right along the bottom of the screen. If a one-player game is selected, the player competes with a static computer opponent that allows objects to collide with it or pass by.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Development==
As one of the earliest games written for the platform, ''Street Racer'' suffered from unattractive, blocky graphics.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} According to Kaplan himself, later racing games released for the Atari, such as [[Activision]]'s 1982 games ''[[Barnstorming (video game)|Barnstorming]]'' and ''[[Grand Prix (video game)|Grand Prix]]'', were able to offer improved graphics and gameplay.<ref name="AAKaplan"/>
In a 2007 interview with ''Digital Press'', Kaplan was asked what he would change about any of the games he had written:
{{quote|''Street Racer'' is the game that lacks good game play. I took out the moving playfield because it didn't flow right (it tended to flicker). If I could change the game to have a smooth-scrolling playfield, it would make the game play better<ref name="DPinterview"/>}}

Kaplan went on to become one of the founders of Activision where he developed ''[[Kaboom! (video game)|Kaboom!]]'', one of the 10 top-selling games for the Atari 2600.<ref name="IGNTopGames"/>

== Reception ==
''Street Racer'' was reviewed in ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine as part of a general review of the [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] where it was given a review score of 5.5 out of 10.<ref name=kaplan/>{{rp|33}} The game did not age well and modern critics have given it poor reviews as well. [[Gamasutra]] have described the "Number cruncher" sub-game as a highlight of the game.<ref name="Gamasutra" />
