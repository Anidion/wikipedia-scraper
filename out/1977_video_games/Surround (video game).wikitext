'''''Surround''''' is a video game programmed by [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] for the [[Atari 2600|Atari Video Computer System]] (Atari VCS).{{efn|The system became known as the Atari 2600 only after the release of the [[Atari 5200]] in 1982.{{sfn|Montfort|2006}}}} The game plays similarly to the arcade game ''[[Blockade (video game)|Blockade]]'' (1976), which allows players to navigate a continuously moving block around an enclosed space as a wall trails behind it. Every time the opposite player has their brick hit a wall, the opposing player earns a single point, with the winner being the first to collect ten points. 

Following [[Gremlin Industries]]' presentation of ''Blockade'' at the 1976 Music Operators of America (MOA) Expo, several other game developers created their own [[Snake (video game genre)|snake]]-style video games, including Atari with their arcade game ''[[Dominos (video game)|Dominos]]'' (1977) and the home console game ''Surround''. The game includes various modes of ''Surround'' which controlling the speed and the amount of directions the player could move. It features a mode titled "Video Graffiti", that allowed players to create simple digital illustrations.

''Surround'' was among the launch titles for the Atari 2600. Initial reviews noted that the game was complex and  generally stating it was a quality game. Retrospective reviews found the graphics and sound for ''Surround'' weak, while remaining effective as a two-player competitive game.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Surround-gameplay-atari-2600.gif|thumb|left|A sample round in ''Surround''. The score of the two players is displayed at the top of the screen while the players maneuver their square as it leaves a wall behind them until while player collides with it.]]
In ''Surround'', two players or one player and a computer-controlled opponent attempt to navigate an enclosed space as a block.{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=114}} As the block moves through the space, a wall trails behind them, forming a barricade. The computer-controlled blocks move automatically across the screen and can be navigated up, down, left and right and, in some modes, diagonally across the playing field.{{sfn|Atari|1978|p=2|ref=manual}} A player earns one point if they manage to make the other player's block to crash into any barricade.{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=114}}{{sfn|Atari|1978|p=1|ref=manual}} The first player to reach 10 points wins.{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=114}}

Variations of the competitive game can be chosen that allow for the blocks to speed up to different intervals as the game continues. Other modes allow for diagonal movement, or offer a feature called "Erase", where the player can push the red controller button to stop creating the trail. A final feature offers wraparound, where the leading blocks will wrap around the playfield when leaving the screen. The final two modes are titled "Video Graffiti" and allow the player to create digital illustrations with the joystick.{{sfn|Atari|1978|p=3|ref=manual}} One variant operates like an [[Etch A Sketch]], while the other offers an erase option.{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=115}}

==Development==
Like many of the Atari VCS launch titles, ''Surround'' was based on an established arcade game.{{sfn|Montfort|Bogost|2009|p=123}} Prior to the release of ''Surround'', designer Lane Hauck developed an arcade game ''[[Blockade (video game)|Blockade]]'' (1976) for [[Gremlin Industries]]. When it was shown at the 1976 Music Operators of America (MOA) Expo in Chicago, it proved popular and Gremlin received 3,000 orders of the game.{{sfn|Horowitz|2018|p=22}}{{sfn|DeWyze|1982}} At the times of ''Blockade''{{'}}s release, counterfeiting was high and public demand for the game was not as long-lasting as the company had hoped.{{sfn|Horowitz|2018|p=22}} As they worked to adapt to their new game to new tech, other companies released similar games such as [[Ramtek Corporation|Ramtek]] with ''[[Barricade (video game)|Barricade]]'', [[Meadows Games]] with ''Bigfoot Bonkers'' and  [[Atari]] with ''[[Dominos (video game)|Dominos]]'' for arcades and ''Surround'' for the Atari VCS.{{sfn|DeWyze|1982}}{{sfn|Bunch|2022|pp=158-159}} 

''Surround'' was programmed by [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]].{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=114}}{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=112}} Miller previously studied computer simulations at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and graduated in 1972. In 1977, Miller responded to an ad by Atari looking for someone with [[microprocessor]] knowledge and was hired and began working on ''Surround'' as his first task.{{sfn|Kunkel|1982|p=13}} In [[Larry Wagner]]'s notes from Atari at the time, the game was labeled as the ''Blockade'' game.{{sfn|Bunch|2022|pp=114-115}} Miller discussed the game in a 1982 interview with [[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]], describing the games graphics as "extremely crude" and its title was in appropriate as "Surrounding your opponent isn't the only, or even the best, way to win. The title, the conception, was weak."{{sfn|Kunkel|1982|p=13}}

The "Video Graffiti" mode in the game was part of a trend of early consoles such as the [[Fairchild Channel F]], the [[RCA Studio II]], the [[Bally Astrocade]] and [[APF-MP1000]] which all contained similar illustration modes.{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=115}}

==Release==
[[File:Atari-2600-Woody-FL.jpg|thumb|right|Surround was one of the launch titles for the Atari Video Computer System, later retitled the Atari 2600.{{sfn|Montfort|2006}}]]
''Surround'' was released for the [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] in September 1977.{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=114}} The game was among the nine launch title for the console, but was not immediately available as the earliest Atari games other than ''[[Combat (video game)|Combat]]'' (1977) were initially available by [[mail order]].{{sfn|Montfort|Bogost|2009|p=123}}{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=37}} Competitors released similar games to ''Blockade'' for their home consoles around the same period, such as the [[Bally Astrocade]] being built-in with ''Checkmate'', the [[APF-MP1000]] with ''Blockout'' and years later with [[Mattel]] releasing ''[[Snafu (video game)|Snafu]]'' (1981) for the [[Intellivision]].{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=115-116}} For the [[Sears]] release of the Atari VCS under their Tele-Games label, the game was titled ''Chase''.{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=114}}{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=112}} ''Surround'' remained in circulation for over a decade, with 97 copies of the game being sold as late as 1988.{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=116}}

''Surround'' was re-released in various compilation formats, such as the ''Atari 80 in One'' (2003) for Windows, the ''[[Atari Anthology]]'' (2004) for [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox]], and the ''[[Atari 50]]'' (2022) compilation for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Steam (service)|Steam]], and [[Xbox One]].{{sfn|Machkovech|2022}}{{sfn|Harris|2004}} It was also released to portable game compilations such as ''[[Atari Greatest Hits]]'' for [[Nintendo DS]] and [[iOS]]-based smartphones.{{sfn|Aaron|2010}}{{sfn|Metacritic|ref=mc-ios}}

From contemporary reviews, two reviews came from ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'', the first review found the game complex and challenging with sound effects that would keep the players alert. The review gave the variations first twelve 12 variations of the game a nine out of ten rating, while the "Video Graffiti" modes were "basically pretty dull" and gave them a five out of ten.
{{sfn|Kaplan|1979|pp=32-33|ref=VideoWinter}} [[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]] and Arnie Katz (under the name Frank T. Laney II) later reviewed the game in ''Video'' magazine, stating they found mode 4 to be the best for solo play, while the computer controlled player did not play aggressively and just tried to avoid making mistakes.{{sfn|Kunkel|Laney|1979|pp=42-43}}{{sfn|Willaert|2020}} The two found mode six to be the most competitive and promoted frequent replays.{{sfn|Kunkel|Laney|1979|pp=42-43}} David H. Ahl found the launch titles for the Atari VCS were designed with continuous fun play and that ''Surround'' has complex gameplay and fantastic sound effects as well as appreciated the "Video Graffiti" option.{{sfn|Ahl|1978|p=38}}

From retrospective reviews, Both the 1983 review from ''TV Gamer'' and 1984 Software Encyclopedia issue of ''Electronic Games'' stated that the game had low-quality graphics and sound.{{sfn|Kunkel|p=101|ref=1984EG}}{{sfn|Williamson|1983|p=37}} The reviewer in ''TV Gamer'' noted that the game was still remained popular and fun, while the ''Electronic Games'' magazine specifically praised the gameplay and competitive nature of the game as excellent, giving it an eight out of ten rating.{{sfn|Kunkel|p=101|ref=1984EG}}{{sfn|Williamson|1983|p=37}} Brett Alan Weiss writing for online database [[AllGame]] echoed the previous statements of the game's sound and visuals being overly simplistic while two-player matches were highly competitive and entertaining.{{sfn|Weiss}} Kevin Bunch in his book ''Atari Archive: Vol.1 1977-1978'' (2022) declared the game to be one of the highlights of the early days of the Atari VCS, saying its unique gameplay to the system and that the 1970s titles for the system were "frequently overlooked, but ''Surround'' is one of the few–alongside with the likes of ''Combat'', ''[[Air-Sea Battle]]'' and ''[[Indy 500 (1977 video game)|Indy 500]]''–that really holds up."{{sfn|Bunch|2022|p=116}}
