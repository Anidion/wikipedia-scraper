'''''Space Wars''''' is a [[shooter video game]] released in [[Arcade game|arcades]] by [[Cinematronics]] in 1977. It is based on the [[PDP-1]] game ''[[Spacewar!]]'' (1962) but instead uses [[vector graphics]] for the visuals. The hardware developed for ''Space Wars'' became the platform for most of the vector-based arcade games from Cinematronics. It was distributed in Japan by [[Taito]] in 1978, and a [[Vectrex]] port was published in 1982.

==Gameplay==

Two players controlled different ships.  One button rotated ship left, another rotated the ship right, one engaged thrust, one fired a shell, and one entered hyperspace (which causes the ship to disappear and reappear elsewhere on the playfield at random).

The game offered a number of gameplay options, including the presence or absence of a star in the middle of the playfield (which exerted a positive or negative gravitational pull), whether the edges of the playfield [[wraparound (video games)|wrapped around]] to their opposite sides, and whether shells bounced. <!-- Was there an option that controlled whether ships had inertia?  Research? -->The game had three particular features: First, the game could not be played in "one player" mode; a human opponent was required. Second, the player's ship could take a glancing hit without dying, but would suffer damage; a cloud of loose ship fragments would break off and float away, after which the ship would be visibly damaged on screen and would turn and accelerate more slowly. Third and most memorable was that the duration of play for any contest was solely governed by the amount of money deposited; each quarter bought a minute and a half of play. A dollar bought six minutes, and for a ten dollar roll of quarters two players could play non-stop for an hour.

==Development==
Larry Rosenthal was an [[MIT]] graduate who was fascinated with the original ''[[Spacewar!]]'' and developed his own custom hardware and software so that he could play the game. [[Cinematronics]] worked with Rosenthal to produce the ''Space Wars'' system.
