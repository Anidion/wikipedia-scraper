'''''Video Olympics''''' is a [[video game]] programmed by Joe Decuir for the [[Atari 2600]]. It is one of the nine 2600 [[launch title]]s [[Atari, Inc.]] published when the 2600 system was released in September 1977. The cartridge is a collection of games from Atari's popular arcade ''[[Pong]]'' series. A similar collection in arcade machine form called ''[[Tournament Table]]'' was published by Atari in 1978.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=10177|name=Tournament Table}}</ref>

''Video Olympics'' was rebranded by [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] as '''''Pong Sports'''''.

==Gameplay==
The games are a collection of bat-and-ball style games, including several previously released by [[Atari, Inc.]] as arcade games. The games use the Video Computer System's [[paddle (game controller)|paddle controllers]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=587 | title=AtariAge - Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Video Olympics (Atari) }}</ref> and are for one to four players (three or four players requires a second set of paddles).

==Reception==
The cartridge and its individual games were reviewed twice in ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine. In the Winter 1979 issue of ''Video'', the cartridge was reviewed as part of a general review of the [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] where it received a review score of 8.5 out of 10, and its constituent games were characterized as "old standbys" but "still lots of fun".<ref name=kaplan>{{cite journal |date= Winter 1979 |editor-last=Kaplan | editor-first=Deeny |title= VideoTest Report Number 18: Atari Video Computer |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 1|issue= 5|pages= 30â€“34|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|33}} A more thorough review appeared in ''Video'''s "Arcade Alley" column in the Summer 1979 issue where the release was generally praised for "tak[ing] Atari's ''Pong'' concept and explor[ing] it to the limit." Individual games were singled out as well, with praise for Volleyball and Robot Pong (described as "astonishingly good"), and criticism for Handball (for its use of a visually disturbing ''blinking'' paddle rather than an ''absent'' paddle to indicate inactive players), and Basketball (described as primitive compared to Atari's own [[Basketball (1978 video game)|1978 version of ''Basketball'']]).<ref name=kunkel>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Laney |first2= Frank T.
