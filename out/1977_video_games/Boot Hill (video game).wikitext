'''''Boot Hill''''' is a [[multidirectional shooter]] [[arcade video game]] released by [[Midway Games|Midway]] in 1977. It is a sequel to the 1975 [[video game]] ''[[Gun Fight]]'', originally released by [[Taito]] as ''Western Gun'' in Japan. It was released under license from Taito, as ''Boot Hill'' is another version of ''Western Gun''.<ref name="Akagi"/>

==Gameplay==
Each player uses a small [[joystick]] to move their [[cowboy]] up and down the play area, while a second, larger joystick is used to aim the pistol and shoot. This larger stick also has a trigger button. The game's goal is to shoot the other player, situated on the opposite side of the game area, with the allocated [[Colt Single Action Army#The Colt Frontier Six-Shooter|6 bullets]]. Wagons move up the middle and cacti litter the play area, both providing temporary cover from the opponent's gunfire and disintegrate when shot. The player may play against the machine or another person in two player mode.

==Reception==
