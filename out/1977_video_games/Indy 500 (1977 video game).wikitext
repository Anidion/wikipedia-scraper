'''''Indy 500''''' is a 1977 [[racing video game]] developed by [[Atari, Inc.]] for its [[Atari 2600|Video Computer System]] (later known as the Atari 2600). It is themed around the [[Indianapolis 500]], and is based on Atari's earlier 8-player arcade game, ''[[Indy 800]]''.

''Indy 500'' was one of the nine [[launch title]]s offered when the Atari 2600 went on sale<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/455866/|title=Atari Video Game, "Indy 500", 1977 - the Henry Ford}}</ref> in September 1977. Sears Tele-Games later re-released it as '''''Race'''''. Included with each game was a set of two driving controllers, which were identical in appearance to the 2600 [[Paddle (game controller)|paddle controller]] but could rotate indefinitely in either direction, among other differences. The game was once again renamed to '''''Race 500''''' in the 2022 compilation, ''[[Atari 50]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last= Machkovech |first=Sam |title=The 103 classic games that did, and didn't, make the Atari 50 anniversary cut |work=Ars Technica |date=September 12, 2022 |access-date=May 24, 2023|url= https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/the-103-classic-games-that-did-and-didnt-make-the-atari-50-anniversary-cut/}}</ref>

Though the packaging material claims it to have fourteen games, this number treats each of the various tracks as a "game". There are actually only three unique game modes, which are as follows. Each can be played with one or two players, and with either a time limit or a score limit.

* '''Standard racing''': Players can race against the clock to complete as many laps as they can,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/CreativeComputingbetterScan197807/page/n39/mode/2up|title = Creative Computing (Better Scan) 1978 07|date = July 1978}}</ref> or compete to finish 25 laps (requires two players). A number of courses were featured, which all have "Ice Race" variations featuring slippery physics.
* '''Crash and Score''': This mode requires two players, but one can be computer-controlled. Either way, the goal is to seek out and drive into a white square randomly placed on the track; this will earn whichever player points, and the square will then be randomly placed elsewhere.
* '''Tag''': Similar to the above, this is a two-player mode only. This is essentially [[Tag (game)|tag]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/CreativeComputingbetterScan197807/page/n39/mode/2up|title = Creative Computing (Better Scan) 1978 07|date = July 1978}}</ref> whoever has the blinking car gains points by avoiding the other player's car who gains points by "tagging" the blinking car, after which the roles of the players are reversed.

== Reception ==
In 1995, [[Flux (magazine)|Flux]] magazine ranked the game 58th on their "Top 100 Video Games".<ref>{{Cite journal |date=April 1995 |title=Top 100 Video Games |url=https://archive.org/details/flux-issue-4/page/n29/mode/2up |journal=Flux |publisher=Harris Publications |issue=4 |pages=31}}</ref>
