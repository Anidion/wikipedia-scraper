'''''Star Ship''''' is a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[space combat simulator]] [[video game]] programmed by [[Bob Whitehead]] and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] for its [[Atari 2600|Video Computer System]] (later known as the Atari 2600). The game was one of the nine [[launch title]]s offered when the Atari VCS was released on September 11, 1977. Based on the Atari [[arcade game]] ''[[Starship 1]]'', it was the first [[outer space|space-related]] game developed for the Atari VCS. The re-branded Sears TeleGames version is titled '''''Outer Space'''''.

''Star Ship'' was removed from Atari's catalog in 1980.<ref name="aa-cats">{{cite web|title=Atari 2600 catalogs|url=https://atariage.com/system_catalogs.php?SystemID=2600|website=AtariAge}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The player(s) use the [[joystick]] controller to achieve one of the following objectives:
* Destroying as many [[spacecraft]] and [[robot]]s as possible within a time limit, all while dodging [[asteroid]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=493 | title=AtariAge - Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Star Ship (Atari) }}</ref>
* Alternating between avoiding enemy fire from spacecraft and firing at the opponent-controlled craft (human or computer).
* Avoiding asteroids and other varied space objects to cover the greatest distance possible.
* Landing the space module on a lunar landing pad. The moon can either be stationary or be computer- or human opponent-controlled.

==Reception==
''Star Ship'' was reviewed in ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine as part of a general review of the [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] where it was given a review score of 4 out of 10, and its individual games were described as "look[ing] nice but [being] hard to get a handle on".<ref name=kaplan>{{cite journal |date= Winter 1979 |editor-last=Kaplan | editor-first=Deeny |title= VideoTest Report Number 18: Atari Video Computer |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 1|issue= 5|pages= 30â€“34|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|33}}
