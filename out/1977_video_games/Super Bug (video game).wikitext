'''''Super Bug''''' is an [[arcade video game]] developed, manufactured, and released by [[Atari, Inc.]] in 1977. The player steers a yellow [[Volkswagen Beetle]] (or "Bug") along a multi-directionally [[scrolling]] track, avoiding the boundaries and occasional obstacles. The game ends when fuel runs out. ''Super Bug'' is in black and white, and the colored car comes from a yellow overlay in the center of the monitor.
