''Slot Racers'' is a [[joystick]]-controlled game with nine game variations<ref>"[http://www.atariage.com/cart_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=441&ItemTypeID=CART Cartridge Scan - Text label]". AtariAge. Accessed 2 March 2009.</ref> programmed within the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]].

The object of the game is to pilot your [[Automobile|car]] through a [[Labyrinth|maze]], while attempting to fire [[missile]]s at your opponent's car as well as evading the missiles your opponent fires at your car.  Each time one of the respective cars is struck by a missile, the player controlling the other car receives one point.  Victory is achieved through the scoring of twenty-five points.  The game itself has four different mazes, and options concerning missile speed, and other factors, within the context of its nine variants, selectable via the ''Game Select'' switch.  The difficulty switches control the rate of fire.<ref name="manual">{{cite web|title=Slot Racers Manual|url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=441|website=AtariAge}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Slot Racers'' was reviewed by ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine in its "Arcade Alley" column where it was described as "a fast-moving head-to-head thriller." Despite noting that the game's plot is patently absurd, and that the game has "virtually nothing to do with either [[slot car]]s or [[racing]] of any kind", the reviewers called it "a triumph" and ranked it as "the most important of the [Atari 2600]'s classic [[maze game|labyrinth games]]".<ref name=kunkel>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Laney, Jr. |first2= Frank |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= May 1981 |title= Arcade Alley: Lure of the Labyrinth - Exploring Maze Games |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 5|issue= 3|pages= 18, 110â€“111|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|18}}
