'''''Beneath Apple Manor''''' is a [[roguelike]] game written by Don Worth for the [[Apple II]] and published by The Software Factory in 1978.<ref name="blog comment"/> Higher resolution "Special Editions" were released in 1982 and 1983, through [[Quality Software]], for the Apple II and [[Atari 8-bit computers]]. It was one of the first video games to use [[procedural generation]].<ref name=summerville2016super>{{Cite book |title=Super Mario as a String: Platformer Level Generation Via LSTMs |author1=Adam Summerville |author2=Michael Mateas |year=2016 |arxiv=1603.00930}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Aycock|first=John|title=Retrogame Archeology|chapter=Procedural Content Generation|date=2016|pages=109–143|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-30004-7_6|isbn=978-3-319-30002-3}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The goal is to obtain a Golden Apple on the bottom floor of the dungeon. There are 10 rooms per level in the low-res version, and 5 in the high-res version. The high-res versions may be played in low-res/text mode, thereby gaining this increase in level size. It is notable for being the first commercial role playing game developed and released for a [[home computer]] as opposed to a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] computer.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Despite being included in the "roguelike" genre, ''Beneath Apple Manor'' actually predates [[Rogue (video game)|''Rogue'']] (created in 1980) by two years.<ref name="Don Worth">[http://worth.bol.ucla.edu/ Don Worth's Personal Home Page]</ref> The creator claims that neither he nor the creators of ''Rogue'' were aware of the other game.<ref name="blog comment">Blog comment to [http://psittacine.com/beneath-apple-manor/#comment-246 Psittacine Labs: Beneath Apple Manor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715125304/http://psittacine.com/beneath-apple-manor/#comment-246 |date=July 15, 2011}} by Don Worth</ref>
