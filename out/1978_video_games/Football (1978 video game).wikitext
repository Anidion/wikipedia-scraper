'''''Football''''' (also known as '''''Atari Football''''') is a 1978 [[List of American football video games|American football video game]] developed and released by [[Atari, Inc.]] for [[Arcade video game|arcades]]. Players are represented by [[X]]s and [[O]]s. While predated by [[Sega]]'s ''World Cup'', ''Football'' is credited with popularizing the [[trackball]] controller and is also the first non-[[racing game|racing]] [[vertically scrolling video game]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Words: GamesRadar US on October 8, 2010 |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-2 |title=Gaming's most important evolutions |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2010-10-08 |access-date=2013-02-13}}</ref> It distributed in Japan by [[Namco]] in 1979.

''Football'' was the second highest-earning arcade video game of 1979 in the United States. That year Atari released a more challenging four-player version of the arcade game programmed by [[Dave Theurer]], who later created ''[[Missile Command]]'' and ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]''.

An [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] home version of ''Football'' was published in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |title=Football |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-2600-vcs-football_7652.html |website=Atari Mania}}</ref> It uses blocky representations of players instead of Xs and Os. In 1982, Atari replaced it with ''[[RealSports Football]]''.

==Development==
The game was designed by Steve Bristow and programmed by Michael Albaugh, with the hardware engineered by Dave Stubben. The game's use of a trackball was inspired by an earlier Japanese [[List of association football video games|association football (soccer) game]] that had used trackball controls.<ref name="Albaugh">{{cite news |last1=Stilphen |first1=Scott |title=Michael Albaugh interview |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/michael_albaugh/interview_michael_albaugh.html |access-date=2 May 2021 |work=Atari Compendium |date=2017 |quote=I saw a soccer game with one (I remember only that it was Japanese, and a soccer game.

An earlier association football game that used trackball controls was [[Sega]]'s ''[[List of Sega arcade video games|World Cup]]'', released seven months earlier in March 1978.<ref name="Famitsu">{{cite book |title=Sega Arcade History |date=2002 |series=[[Famitsu DC]] |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |page=34 |url=https://archive.org/details/segaarcadehistoryfamitsudc/page/n35 |language=ja}}</ref><ref name="Sega">{{cite web |title=WORLD CUP（ワールドカップ） |url=https://sega.jp/history/arcade/product/15316/ |website=[[Sega]] |access-date=2 May 2021 |language=ja}}</ref> However, [[Steven L. Kent]] reported in 2001 that Stubben attributed the earlier trackball soccer game to [[Taito]].<ref name="Kent"/> In a later 2017 interview, Albaugh said he was uncertain which company it was from, but remembers it was from a Japanese company.<ref name="Albaugh"/>

Atari's ''Football'' was released in October 1978.<ref name="atari_production99"/>

==Ports==
On the Atari VCS, two teams of green and white players, each of four men, playing against each other. In a first game-option, before each play the player can select a formation, and then during each play the player controls their movement as a unit using the joystick controller. In a second game option, the player only chooses the formation with the play being carried out automatically according to a pre-selected plan. A third game-option is similar to the second except that the user may kick or punt at any time.<ref name="Creative Computing">{{cite journal |last1=Ahl |first1=David H. |title=Atari Video Computer Cartridges - Football |journal=Creative Computing |date=October 1979 |volume=5 |issue=10 |page=[https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1979-10/page/n41 38] |url=https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1979-10 |access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref>
