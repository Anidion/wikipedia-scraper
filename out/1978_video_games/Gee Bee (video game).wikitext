{{nihongo foot|'''''Gee Bee'''''|ジービー|Jī Bī|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a block breaker/video pinball hybrid [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Namco]] in 1978. The player controls a set of paddles with a rotary knob, with the objective being to score as many points as possible by deflecting a ball against bricks, pop bumpers and other objects in the playfield. It was developed by [[Toru Iwatani]], known as the creator of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Pole Position]]''. Outside Japan, it was published by [[Gremlin Industries]].

''Gee Bee'' was the first video game to be designed in-house by Namco – prior to this, the company had manufactured arcade [[electro-mechanical games]] (such as ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]'' and ''[[F-1 (arcade game)|F-1]]'') and published a number of video games by [[Atari, Inc.]] (notably ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'') in Japan. Iwatani originally wanted to produce pinball machines for the company, but higher-ups at Namco disapproved of the idea. As a compromise, Iwatani instead made a video game with pinball-elements, combined with mechanics established in ''Breakout''.

''Gee Bee'' was the eighth highest-grossing [[1978 in video games|arcade video game of 1978]] in Japan, and sold 10,000 units worldwide. However, it was not as big of a success as hoped, but it would nevertheless help establish Namco's presence in the [[video game industry]]. Two sequels were produced in 1979, ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' and ''[[Cutie Q]]''.

''Gee Bee'' is a block breaker arcade game intermixed with elements of a pinball table. The player uses a rotary dial to control a set of paddles on-screen,<ref name="Iwatani">{{cite book|last=Iwatani |first=Toru |title=Introduction to Pac-Man's Game Science |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |year=2005 |page=33}}</ref> the objective being to score as many points as possible by deflecting a ball towards objects placed on the board – these include ''Breakout''-like brick formations, pop bumpers that award ten points each when hit, and spinners that slow down the ball.<ref name="Akagi">{{cite book|last=Masumi|first= Akagi |title=It Started With Pong |publisher=Amusement News Agency |year=2005 |pages=183–184}}</ref> Having the ball touch the "NAMCO" rollover symbols (replaced by the Gremlin logo in the North American version) causes them to light up and having all of them lit up increases the score multiplier.<ref name="Akagi"/>

==Development and release==
''Gee Bee'' was developed by [[Toru Iwatani]] and was Namco's first video game produced in-house.<ref name="Retro Gamer">{{cite magazine|url=https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____117|title=Breakout The Clones|date=2013|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=117|page=40|access-date=2 August 2019}}</ref> The company began their insertion into game development in July 1976, when Shigeichi Ishimura, a Namco [[electro-mechanical game]] designer, proposed the idea of creating a video arcade game utilizing a [[CPU]], with information accumulated from his work on electro-mechanical games.<ref name="AAN">{{cite book |author1=Microcomputer BASIC Editorial Department |title=All About Namco |date=December 1986 |publisher=Dempa Shimbun |isbn=978-4885541070 |language=ja}}</ref> Namco approved of the idea and purchased a surplus amount of PDA-08 microcomputers from [[NEC]], employees being assigned to study the system's potential to create video games.<ref name="AAN"/>

==Reception and legacy==
The game is reported to have sold nearly 10,000 units, which was a good sales figure for its time, but ''Gee Bee'' was not as successful as Namco hoped it would be, due to coin drop earnings per unit falling below expectations and due to competition from [[Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]''.<ref name="4Gamer">{{cite web |last1=Kurokawa |first1=Fumio |title=ビデオゲームの語り部たち 第4部：石村繁一氏が語るナムコの歴史と創業者・中村雅哉氏の魅力 |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |language=ja |website=[[4Gamer]] |publisher=Aetas |access-date=2 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801205701/https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |archive-date=1 August 2019 |date=17 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, ''Gee Bee'' was the eighth highest-earning [[1978 in video games|arcade video game of 1978]] in Japan,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=人気マシン・ベスト3|trans-title=Popular Machines: Best 3 |magazine=[[:ja:ゲームマシン|Game Machine]]|issue=113|publisher=[[:ja:アミューズメント通信社|Amusement Press, Inc.]]|date=February 1979|pages=2–3|lang=ja|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19790201p.pdf#page=2}}</ref> and helped establish Namco as a prime video game developer in Japan, leading to them producing their own arcade games alongside publishing those from other companies.<ref name="Akagi"/><ref name="AAN"/> The November 11, 1978 issue of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' complimented the game's cabinet artwork,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Namco's AMOA Exhibit Will Focus On Four Machines |date=11 November 1978 |magazine=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] |page=C-16 |issn=0008-7289 |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Cash-Box/70s/1978/CB-1978-11-11.pdf}}</ref> while the December 30 issue stated that it had a "good looking cabinet and graphics".<ref>{{cite book |title=In Review |date=30 December 1978 |publisher=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Cash-Box/70s/1978/CB-1978-12-30.pdf |access-date=2 August 2019}}</ref> In a retrospective, Earn Green of ''[[Allgame]]'' noted the game's importance for [[Namco]], being Toru Iwatani's first video game for the company.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Earl |title=Gee Bee - Review |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=10139&tab=review |website=[[Allgame]] |access-date=2 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114130226/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=10139&tab=review |archive-date=14 November 2014}}</ref> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' listed ''Gee Bee'' as one of the best ''Breakout'' clones for its notability as Namco's first internally designed video game.<ref name="Retro Gamer"/>

''Gee Bee'' would spawn two sequel titles – ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' was released a year later in 1979. This game includes colorized graphics, new gameplay additions such as a 1,000 point pop bumper, and the ability to earn extra lives.<ref name="AAN"/> A second sequel, ''[[Cutie Q]]'', was released in 1979 – this one was not developed by Iwatani, but rather Shigeru Yokoyama, who would later create ''[[Galaga]]'', although Iwatani designed a number of the sprites.<ref>{{cite web |author=Namco Bandai Games |author-link=Namco Bandai Games |title=Galaga - 30th Anniversary Developer Interview |url=http://shmuplations.com/galaga/ |website=Galaga WEB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606111333/http://shmuplations.com/galaga/ |archive-date=6 June 2019 |date=2011 |access-date=13 July 2019}}</ref> ''Cutie Q'' is notable for featuring "cute" characters, which would become a key inspiration for character design in Iwatani's next work, ''[[Pac-Man]]'', released a year later.<ref name="kohler">{{cite book|last=Kohler|first=Chris|title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]]|year=2016|pages=[https://www.scribd.com/read/327139764/Power-Up-How-Japanese-Video-Games-Gave-the-World-an-Extra-Life 51-2]}}</ref> Both ''Bomb Bee'' and ''Cutie Q'' were ported to the PlayStation in 1996 in the Japanese version of ''Namco Museum Vol. 2'';<ref>{{cite web |title=ナムコミュージアム VOL.2 |url=https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/cs/list/nm/vol2.php |publisher=[[Namco]] |language=ja |access-date=19 May 2019}}</ref> however, international versions replaced both games with ''[[Super Pac-Man]]''.
