'''''Codebreaker''''' is a video game released in 1978 by [[Atari, Inc.]] for the Atari VCS (later renamed the [[Atari 2600]]).<ref name="Classic Home Video Games">{{cite book |last1=Weiss |first1=Brett |title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984: A Complete Reference Guide |date=2011 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0786487554 |pages=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&dq=%22Human+Cannonball%22&pg=PA42 |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref> It was in the first wave of Atari VCS games to follow the original nine launch titles. It was one of three cartridges to accompany the introduction of the Atari keyboard controller, an add-on launched in response to claims of false advertising that the VCS is a "computer" (the other two were ''Hunt & Score'' and ''Brain Games'').<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lendino |first1=Jamie |title=Adventure: The Atari 2600 at the Dawn of Console Gaming |date=2018 |publisher=Ziff Davis |isbn=978-1732355200 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkaoDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22codebreaker%22&pg=PA46 |accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref>

The games may be played in single-player mode, or in a two-player mode where the players play together.<ref name="Classic Home Video Games" />

==Reception==
Contemporary reviewers were relatively positive about the game but all mentioned its similarity to [[Mordecai Meirowitz]]'s ''[[Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]]''. The British computer games magazine ''TV Gamer'', described it as "not the most original game" but also described it as an enjoyable brain-teaser.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Codebreaker |journal=TV Gamer |date=Autumn 1983 |issue=2 |page=22 |url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/magazines/tv_gamer/tv_gamer_autumn83.pdf |accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref> ''Personal Computing Magazine'' described it as "[b]ased on the ''Mastermind'' concept".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Codebreaker |journal=Personal Computing Magazine |date=1983 |volume=7 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgJWAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Codebreaker%22+%22atari%22 |accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref>
