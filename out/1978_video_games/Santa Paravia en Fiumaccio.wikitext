==Gameplay==
The game consists of yearly turns, beginning in 1400; each turn involves the allocation of [[grain]], counted in [[stere]]s, and funds, counted in [[florin]]s, attempting to grow the colony in both population and size. A ruler must ensure that sufficient grain supplies are available to feed his people; by distributing excess grain, a ruler can encourage more citizens to move into his city-state. However, often [[famine]] and [[rat]]s cause grain reserves to diminish.

Funds can be spent to purchase more land, military forces, or various types of structures. These structures include revenue producing mills and markets as well as prestigious [[palace]]s and [[cathedral]]s. (The 'SoftSide' version had a [[Glitch|code error]] that allowed you to keep all your grain, even when you went bankrupt.)

The different social classes present in this game are [[serf]]s, [[clergy]], [[merchant]]s and [[nobility]].

Based loosely on the text game ''[[Hamurabi (video game)|Hamurabi]]'', ''Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio'' was an early [[god game]]. It combined '[[guns and butter]]' economic tradeoffs with graphic development of a kingdom with buildings being constructed and shown on the screen as well as character development, shown as progressive promotions<ref>{{cite book |title=The Naked Serviceman |last=Engel |first=George M. |year=2007 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-1-4303-1785-2 |pages=47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6oXg8el9WdsC&q=%22Santa+Paravia%22&pg=PA47 |access-date=2008-09-13}}</ref> from baron to king.
