'''''Personk''''' is a 1978 video game, and the debut work of Tom Snyder, who would later release many educational series under [[Tom Snyder Productions]].

==Development==
Snyder is an educator and video game developer. Snyder, who had a master's degree in teaching, attained a teaching job in the 1970s and eventually began thinking about teaching aids.<ref name="Personk-Herald">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/13446983/|title=Tyrone Daily Herald from Tyrone, Pennsylvania on September 6, 1984 Â· Page 2|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}</ref>

In 1978, Snyder had a meeting arranged with the head of game acquisitions at [[Parker Brothers|Parker Bros]]. He hoped to present a wood-wire-string contraption named ''Personk'', that was a simplified model of a computer. Despite having planned the meeting for months, constantly redesigning the game and putting considerable time and money into the project, he went to the meeting on the wrong date and lost the opportunity.<ref name="SnoopTroop">{{cite magazine |title=Profile of a snooper trooper |magazine=[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]] |publisher=[[Ahl Computing, Inc.]] |volume=9 |issue=4 |date=April 1983 |page=130 |issn=0097-8140 |url=https://archive.org/stream/creative_computing_apr83#page/n131 |access-date=March 20, 2018}}</ref>

This event gave Snyder a creative burst of energy; within the week he had purchased a microcomputer, taught himself to program, and transformed the three-dimensional ''Personk'' into a piece of software for children<ref name="SnoopTroop"/> with the assistance of a Radio Shack Model 1.<ref name="Personk-Herald"/>

==Legacy==
His first innovation, the game turned into an experiment that foreshadowed the rest of his career.<ref name="Personk-Herald"/> Snyder would immediately follow the game with a series of educational titles collectively referred to as [[The Search Series]].<ref name="SnoopTroop"/>
