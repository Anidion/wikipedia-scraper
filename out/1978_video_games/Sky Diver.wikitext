The object of ''Sky Diver'' is to jump out of a plane, release a parachute and land on the landing pad. To get higher points, the player must release the parachute closer to the ground. The player has nine jumps. If the landing pad is missed, the player loses points. The highest score possible is 99 points (11 points maximum per jump).

==Legacy==
''Sky Diver'' has been re-released as part of compilations such as ''[[Atari Anthology]]''. In July 2010, the game was included on [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] ''[[Game Room]]'' service.

A remake of the game has been announced for release exclusively for the [[Intellivision Amico]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Intellivision® Reveals Initial Details For The Upcoming Amico™ Home Video Game Console!|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intellivision-reveals-initial-details-for-the-upcoming-amico-home-video-game-console-300734998.html|website=PR Newswire}}</ref>
