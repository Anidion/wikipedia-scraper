'''''Basketball''''' is a [[sports video game]] programmed by [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] for the [[Atari 2600|Atari Video Computer System]] (later renamed to the Atari 2600) and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] in 1978. The cartridge presents a game of one-on-one basketball for by one or two players, one of the few early VCS titles to have a single-player mode with an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled opponent. Miller wrote a version of ''Basketball'' for [[Atari 8-bit computers]] with improved graphics, published in 1979. That same year, an [[Basketball (1979 video game)|arcade version]] similar to the computer port was released by Atari but in black and white.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Basketball-2600.png|thumb|left|The purple player is dribbling a square, blue ball (Atari VCS).]]

At the start of the game, both players are at the center of the court. A [[jump ball]] is thrown between them to begin play. The player in the offensive position (i.e. in possession of the ball) always faces a basket representing the assigned shooting target, and defensive players always face the opponent. Each player can move in eight directions with the joystick; the player with the ball constantly [[dribble]]s it. The defensive player may steal the ball when it leaves the opponent's hands (either in mid-dribble or mid-shot).

After either player scores, the shooter is reset to the center of the court and becomes the defensive player (defending the opponent) while the former defender is set under the basket to inbound the ball and take an offensive chance. The player with the highest score after four minutes is the winner.

The game has two difficulty levels selected with the Difficulty Switch. In "B" position, the player can move from goal to goal much more quickly than the "A" position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareID=854 |title=Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Basketball (Atari) |publisher=[[Atari Age]] |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Reception==
In ''[[Video (magazine)|Video]]'' magazine's "Arcade Alley" review column, reviewers described it as "that rare game that plays well solitaire or with a human opponent," and noted that "the game definitely captures the flavor of basketball." The "fan's eye perspective" was singled out for particular praise, and the game as a whole was found to "offer the most exciting four minutes of one-on-one hoop action [the reviewers had] seen so far."<ref name=kunkel>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Laney |first2= Frank T.

==Legacy==
In the 1980 [[comedy film]] ''[[Airplane!]]'', flight controllers are seen playing Atari VCS ''Basketball'' rather than watching the monitor.
