The player is shown a grid with white squares in it and must guess which square the flag is behind. To aid the locating of the flag the player may be shown a flag or a number to indicate where the flag may be.<ref name="Video Game Critic">{{cite web |title=Atari 2600 Reviews 2600 - F |url=https://videogamecritic.com/2600ff.htm |website=Videogamecritic.com |accessdate=4 September 2019}}</ref>
