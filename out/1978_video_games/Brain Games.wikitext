''Brain Games'' was suggested in the 1984 book ''Clinical Management of Memory Problems'' as an effective clinical device for memory retraining exercises. Noted for having a variety of useful games, patients would be faced with auditory and visual cues that may improve spatial reasoning.<ref>Wilson; et al., p. 165.</ref>

"Touch Me", which is the video version of the [[Touch Me (arcade game)|1974 arcade game]] of the same name,<ref name=her/> was the precursor for the handheld game [[Simon (game)|Simon]], in which the player must match a sequence of tones, and the computer would add a new note upon each successive turn.<ref name="man">{{cite web|title=Atari 2600 Manuals (HTML) - Brain Games (Atari) |url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareID=884 |work=[[AtariAge]] |accessdate=January 8, 2023 |archive-date=December 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211205075338/https://www.atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareID=884 |url-status=live }}</ref> This continues up until the player completes a 32 consecutive note execution.<ref>Atari Catalog (1981), p. 18.</ref> In "Find Me", the player must detect subtle differences in the figures as they are flashed on the screen;<ref>Johnson, p. 104.</ref> in "Picture Me", the player must memorize the placement of the picture sets, which the computer then rearranges. "Count Me" requires the player to match a sequence of digits played by the computer; upon correctly ordering the digits, the computer adds a new digit to the sequence. "Add Me" also utilizes numeric digits as part of the challenge, although the player must determine the sum the digits presented by the computer. Finally, "Play Me", which turns the 12-button keypad controller into a musical instrument, allows players to play the songs "[[Happy Birthday to You]]", "[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]", and "[[Three Blind Mice]]". If two keypad controllers are plugged in, the players can play a duet with "[[Row Your Boat]]" as well.<ref name=man/> Adding to the timed challenges are "diabolical distractions",<ref name=ac/> such as loud noises.<ref name=man/>

Atari later released a handheld version of ''Touch Me''.<ref name=her>Herman, p. 36.</ref>
