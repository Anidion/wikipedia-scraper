It was released on [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] for [[VIC-20]] in 1982 and for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Clowns - Commodore 64|url=https://www.gamesdatabase.org/game/commodore-64/clowns|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011070137/http://www.gamesdatabase.org:80/game/commodore-64/clowns |archive-date=2016-10-11 |access-date=November 12, 2020|website=Games Database}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
Players start with two clowns and they get to control where they go with a seesaw. The goal is to prevent them from falling to the ground, or else the level is lost. Players get three lives and can earn more after getting a certain number of points. Getting to the center ring at the top of the sky, while gaining points from popping balloons, will help players complete levels. As the player advances to the next level, hazards and objects will start appearing in the air trying to hurt the clowns.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Clowns (Game)|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/clowns/3030-1564/|access-date=2020-11-12|website=Giant Bomb|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Clowns, Arcade Video game by Midway Mfg.
