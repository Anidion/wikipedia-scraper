'''''Sargon''''' (stylized in [[all caps]]) is a line of [[chess]]-playing [[software]] for [[personal computer]]s. The original ''Sargon'' from 1978 was written in [[assembly language]] by Dan and Kathleen "Kathe" Spracklen for the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]-based [[Wavemate Jupiter II]].<ref name='CHM Interview'>

==History==
[[File:Sargon I screenshot.png|thumb|[[Apple II series|Apple II]] version]]
''Sargon'' was introduced at the 1978 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] where it won the first [[computer chess]] tournament held strictly for [[microcomputer]]s, with a score of 5–0.<ref name="spracklen197810">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1978-10/1978_10_BYTE_03-10_Chess_for_the_Microcomputer#page/n87/mode/2up | title=First Steps in Computer Chess Programming | work=[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] | date=October 1978 | accessdate=17 October 2013 | author=Spracklen, Kathy and Dan | pages=86}}</ref><ref name="harding1985">{{cite book | authorlink=Tim Harding (chess player) | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pECeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 | title=The New Chess Computer Book | publisher=Pergamon Press | author=Harding, T.

===Commercialization===
[[Image:Sargon I screenshot (notation).png|thumb|250px|The notation screen from ''Sargon I'' for the Apple II]]

When magnetic media publishing became widely available, a US Navy petty officer, Paul Lohnes, ported ''Sargon'' to the [[TRS-80]], altering the graphics, input, and housekeeping routines but leaving the Spracklens' chess-playing algorithm intact. Paul consulted with the Spracklens, who were both living in San Diego at the time, to make the TRS-80 version an instant success with the help of Hayden Book's newly established software division: [[Hayden Software]]. Paul was not involved in further refinements to the TRS-80 version due to his reassignment to sea duty shortly after signing the deal with Hayden Software.

In the early 1980s, SARGON CHESS was ported to the [[Nascom (computer kit)|Nascom]] (by Bits & PCs, 1981), [[Exidy Sorcerer]], and [[Sharp MZ|Sharp MZ 80K]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sharpmz.org/mz-80k/sargonchess.html |title=SARGON CHESS | date=11 September 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425193313/http://www.sharpmz.org/mz-80k/sargonchess.html |archive-date=25 April 2017 }}</ref> A [[Rewrite (programming)|complete rewrite]] was necessary later for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], programmed by Kathleen's brother Gary Shannon. Both were published by Hayden Software.

===Improved versions===
The Spracklens made significant improvements on the original program and released ''[[Sargon II (video game)|Sargon II]]''.<ref name='CHM Interview'/> J. Mishcon reviewed ''Sargon II'' in the October 1980 issue of ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' magazine, stating that the program beat him regularly on level 5, which took 40 minutes per move.<ref name=TSG80>{{cite magazine|last=Mishcon|first=J.|title= Capsule Reviews: Sargon II|magazine=[[The Space Gamer]]|date= October 1980|number=32|page=28 }}</ref> He often beat the program at level 3—when it considered moves for about two minutes—and stated that "Level 0 is an idiot but responds instantly".<ref name=TSG80/>{{efn|Mishcon stated, "As a reference, I play medium chess, know a few openings, and play regularly with a guy rated 1200+ by the United States Chess Federation."<ref name=TSG80/>}}

''Sargon 2.5'', sold as a ROM module for the Chafitz Modular Game System, was identical to ''Sargon II'' but incorporated [[Permanent brain|pondering]].<ref name="martellaro198101">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-01/1981_01_BYTE_06-01_Hand-held_Computers#page/n209/mode/2up | title=The Newest Sargon - 2.5 | work=BYTE | date=January 1981 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Martellaro, John | pages=208–212}}</ref> It received a 1641 rating at the [[Paul Masson]] tournament in June–July 1979, and 1736 at the San Jose City College Open in January 1980.{{r|harding1985}}

<!-- Unclear whether 3.0 is same or different from III discussed above -->
''Sargon 3.0'' finished in seventh place at the October 1979 North American Computer Chess Championship. The competition had improved, but 3.0 drew against [[Cray Blitz]] and easily defeated ''Mychess'', its main microcomputer rival. In December, 3.0 easily won the second microcomputer championship in London.{{r|harding1985}}

<!-- Unclear whether III is same or different from 3.0 discussed above -->
''[[Sargon III]]'' was a complete rewrite. Instead of an ''[[Exchange (chess)|exchange]] evaluator'', this version used a ''capture search'' [[algorithm]]. Also included was a [[chess opening]] repertoire. This third version was written originally for the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] assembler. In 1978, Sargon was converted to Z80 neumonics/assembler code by Paul H. Lohnes, as self taught computer enthusiast while he was still in the US Navy. He sold the publishing rights to Hayden Software for the Radio Shack TRS-80 platform. It was commercially published for other computing platforms by [[Hayden Software]] in 1983. Apple contacted the Spracklens and, after a port for [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[assembly language|assembly]], ''Sargon III'' was the first third-party executable software for the [[Macintosh]].<ref name='CHM Interview'/>

==Legacy==
After the demise of Hayden Software, later chess programs were also released under the name ''Sargon'', including ''[[Sargon 4]]'' ([[Spinnaker Software]]), ''[[Sargon V: World Class Chess|Sargon V]]'' ([[Activision]]) and a [[CD-i]] title simply named ''Sargon Chess''. The CD-i game received 75% from the French magazine ''Génération 4''.<ref name="Gen4">{{cite magazine |last1=Renouard |first1=Yann |title=CD-i Test - Sargon Chess |journal=Génération 4 |date=December 1992 |issue=50 |url=https://archive.org/details/generation4-magazine-050/page/n79/mode/2up |language=French}}</ref> A compilation titled ''4-in-1 Fun Pak'' was released for the [[Game Boy]] in 1992. One of the games in the compilation is ''Sargon Chess''.<ref name="ASM">{{cite magazine |title=Game Boy Corner - 4-in-1 Fun Pak |journal=[[Aktueller Software Markt]] |date=December 1992 |volume=7 |issue=12 |page=149 |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/f/fe/ASM_DE_1992-12.pdf |language=German}}</ref>

The Spracklens concurrently wrote the engines for the dedicated chess computers produced by Fidelity Electronics, which won the first four [[World Computer Chess Championship#World Microcomputer Chess Championship|World Microcomputer Chess Championships]].

===The Botvinnik game===
[[File:Botvinnik vs Sargon, 1983.gif|thumb|Animation of game against Botvinnik]]
The three-time [[world chess champion]] [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] played a game with Sargon in 1983 at [[Hamburg]]. He did not play his best moves but only tested the program's capabilities. Botvinnik himself was also involved in chess program development.
