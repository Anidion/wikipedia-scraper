The game is played using a matrix of numbered panels, either 4 x 4 (for 16 panels) or 5 x 6 (for 30 panels). Using the keypad, players enter the number of the panels they wish to reveal. If the images behind the two panels match, the panels are removed and the player scores 1 or 2 points, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to, along with an extra turn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/manual_page.html?SystemID=2600&SoftwareLabelID=203&maxPages=6&currentPage=2|title=Atari 2600 Manuals - Game of Concentration (Atari)|work=AtariAge.com|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>

The game has a total of eight variations, four each for each matrix size and four have wild cards. Each matrix can be played by either a single player or by two players taking turns; in single-player games, the player attempts to clear the matrix with as few incorrect matches as possible. Also, players can enable wild cards that will match any image on the board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/manual_page.html?SystemID=2600&SoftwareLabelID=203&maxPages=6&currentPage=5|title=Atari 2600 Manuals - Game of Concentration (Atari)|work=AtariAge.com|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>
