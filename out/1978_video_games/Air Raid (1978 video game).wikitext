The player uses a five direction missile launcher to destroy a random sequence of small quickly moving and large slowly moving aircraft (represented by [[ASCII]] characters) crossing the screen at seven altitudes. Collisions between two aircraft destroy both and produce a higher scoring parachute target, while aircraft destroyed by missiles explode, producing a cloud of debris capable of destroying aircraft below.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Small System Software |year=1979 |title=Air Raid: A Real-Time Shooting Gallery |url=https://archive.org/details/h-and-e-computronics-software-catalog-no-3-19xx/page/n27 |magazine=TRS-80 Software Catalog |publisher=H & E Computronics |location=New City, NY |issue=3 |page=27 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |editor-last=Blank |editor-first=George |date=May 1979 |title=TSE Market Basket Catalog |url=https://archive.org/details/softside-magazine-08/page/n65 |magazine=[[SoftSide]] |publisher=SoftSide Publications |location=Milford, NH |page=66 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>
