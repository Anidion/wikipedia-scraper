==Gameplay==
[[Image:Atari Fire Truck video game screenshot.png|thumb|left|230px|Screenshot]]
Players must cooperate to drive the truck through traffic as far as possible without crashing, avoiding parked cars and oil slicks. While the game can be played with one player, it was primarily designed for two. The front player steers the tractor of the truck sitting down, controlling the gas and brakes, while the rear player stands and steers the [[Fire apparatus#Tiller ladder|tiller]] for the rear wheels, controlling the swing of the trailer. If playing with only one player, the computer controls either the front or the back accordingly.<ref name=playmetermay/>

Flashing arrows appear on the course to indicate correct turns at intersections. The amount of time left in a play session is indicated by the amount of fuel left. Players can select from an easy or hard course.<ref name=playmetermay>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/play-meter-volume-4-number-9-october-1st-1981-raw-scans_2446/page/n59/mode/2up |title=Red light and sirens! |magazine=Play Meter |volume=4 |number=9 |pages=65 |date=15 May 1978}}</ref> Along with their scores, players are given a driver rating out of "Sorry", "So-So", "Good" or "Ace".<ref name="FT AG"/>{{sfn|Atari|1978|pp=14}}

The cabinet also provides the players with bells and horns, although these have no use in the actual game.<ref name=klov>{{cite web|url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7814|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230912080747/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7814|archive-date= 12 September 2023|title=Fire Truck|language=En|url-status=live|website=Museum of the Game}}</ref>

==Development==
''Fire Truck'' was built on the technology of ''[[Super Bug (video game)|Super Bug]]'', the first arcade game to feature a scrolling playfield. John Ray adapted the hardware, and Howard Delman enhanced the software. To allow for solo play, Delman needed to create a computer intelligence that could drive either the front or the back of the fire truck, which he said "took a lot of tweaking to get something that would feel okay without feeling over controlling".<ref name="stilphen"/>

==Reception==
In the United States, ''RePlay'' magazine listed ''Smokey Joe'' as the ninth highest-grossing [[1978 in video games|arcade game of 1978]] and the original ''Fire Truck'' as the year's 12th highest-grossing title.<ref name="Replay">{{cite magazine |title=Video Games |magazine=RePlay |date=November 1978}}</ref>
