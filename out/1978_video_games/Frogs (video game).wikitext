'''''Frogs''''' is a [[single-player]] [[Action game|action]] [[arcade game]] released by [[Gremlin Industries|Gremlin]] in [[1978 in video gaming|1978]]. It notably featured a jumping character (predating ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' by 3 years).<ref name=pdf>[http://www.thelogbook.com/phosphor/1978/frogs/ ''Frogs''], Earl Green, Phosphor Dot Fossils, retrieved 2010-2-16</ref> The game's graphics are "projected" by laying the monitor flat on its back and reflecting the computer-generated graphics of the frogs and flies toward the player via a mirror at a 45-degree angle. (The game's graphics were actually generated and shown backward, so the mirror reflection would show letters and numbers properly.)<ref name=pdf /> The game was distributed by [[Sega]] in Japan.<ref name="Famitsu">{{cite book |chapter=1977-78 |title=Sega Arcade History |date=2002 |series=[[Famitsu DC]] |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |pages=33–6 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/segaarcadehistoryfamitsudc/page/n34 |lang=ja}}</ref>

In 1980, [[Adventure International]] published a similar game with varying names–''Frog'', ''Frogs'', ''Frog on a Log''–for the TRS-80.
