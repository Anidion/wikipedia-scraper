'''''Depth Charge''''' is an action video game for the [[Apple II]] programmed by [[Chris Oberth]] and published by [[The Elektrik Keyboard]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]] in 1978.<ref name="ek">{{cite book

==Gameplay==
Like the 1977 arcade game ''[[Depthcharge]]'' that it emulates, ''Depth Charge'' puts the player in control of a small ship that drops [[depth charges]] onto passing submarines. In the arcade original, the player moves the ship left and right, but in ''Depthcharge'' the ship automatically makes three passes from right to left across the top of the screen, and four submarines at varying depths move from left to right below it.  Destroying deeper subs earns  more points. An extra pass is awarded at 600 points and another at 900.<ref name="ek" /><ref name="dc">{{cite video game
