Cartridge number 1 in the official [[Philips]] line of games for the [[Philips Videopac]] contains three games: '''''Race''''', '''''Spin-out''''', and '''''Cryptogram'''''. In the [[United States]], it was distributed for the [[Magnavox Odyssey²]]  as '''''Speedway / Spin-out / Cryptologic'''''.

==Gameplay==

===''Race''===
''Race'' is a fairly simple game where you control a car travelling on an infinite straight stretch of road. You start from a standstill, and move the stick up to accelerate, down to decelerate, right and left move the car sideways. The object is to keep driving for as long as possible, without crashing into any of the other cars. If you ever slow to a stop then your car gets run over.

===''Spin-out''===
''Spin-out'' is a two-player game, in which each player controls a car around a loop of racetrack. The winner is the one who completes three or fifteen laps the fastest, there are time penalties for crashing into a wall or spinning when hit by the other car.

===''Cryptogram''===
''Cryptogram'' is also for two players, one types in a message of up to fourteen characters, then hits enter to scramble it. The other player types in what they think it is, and loses points for each incorrect letter, in a similar fashion to [[Hangman (game)|hangman]].

==Reception==
The cartridge was reviewed by ''Video'' magazine in its "Arcade Alley" column where it was praised as "a good showcase for the [Odyssey²]'s capabilities" whose varied gameplay is "well calculated to whet the arcade addict's appetite for more". The three constituent games were reviewed individually as well with ''Speedway'' receiving faint criticism for its overly easy slow speed setting, ''Spin-Out'' being described as "best with two players", and ''Crypto-logic'' praised as "an easy way for parents to help their school-age children with spelling."<ref name=kunkel>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (journalist)|last2= Laney |first2= Frank T.
