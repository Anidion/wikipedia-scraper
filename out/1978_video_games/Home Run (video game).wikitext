'''''Home Run''''' is a 1978 [[sports video game]] developed and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] for the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed to the [[Atari 2600]]). It was the first [[baseball]]-themed game released for an Atari platform.<ref name="Weiss">{{cite book |last1=Weiss |first1=Bret |title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide |date=20 December 2011 |publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers |isbn=9780786487554 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&dq=%22Atari+2600%22+%22Home+Run%22&pg=PA97 |access-date=20 February 2021}}</ref><ref name="Lapetino">{{cite book |last1=Lapetino |first1=Tim |title=Art Of Atari |date=26 October 2016 |publisher=Dynamite Entertainment |isbn=9781524101060 |page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z50oDAAAQBAJ&dq=%22Atari%22+%22Home+Run%22&pg=PA83 |access-date=20 February 2021}}</ref> The game received mostly negative critical reception due to its unrealistic portrayal of the sport. It was one of the games used by console competitor [[Mattel]] to show the quality improvement of [[Intellivision]] sports games over the Atari VCS.

Atari replaced ''Home Run'' with ''[[RealSports Baseball]]'' in 1982.

==Gameplay==
Teams have only one to three players, and the fielders must run with the ball to [[tag out|tag players out]], with throwing of the ball to [[force play|force players out]] not being possible.<ref name="Joystik" /> There is no [[pitcher's mound]], with the pitcher instead standing at second base. The game lacks [[Fly ball (baseball)|fly balls]] and independent fielders.<ref name="Lapetino" />

Depending on the selected game mode, only zero to two [[infielder]]s are present in the game, and when either the pitcher or one of the infielders catches the ball everyone but the [[baserunner]]s and the ball-catcher instantly disappears from view. The home team has to bat at the bottom of the 9th inning regardless of whether they are winning or not, and there is no extra innings if the game is tied.<ref name="Wong" />

==Development and marketing==
''Home Run'' was designed and programmed by [[Bob Whitehead]], who went on to found [[Activision]], and David Rolfe.<ref name="Hawken">{{cite book |last1=Hawken |first1=Kieren |title=The A–Z of Atari 2600 Games: Volume 2 |date=31 August 2018 |publisher=Andrews UK |isbn=978-1785387630 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JE3DwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Home+Run%22+%22Whitehead%22+%22Atari%22&pg=PT38 |access-date=20 February 2021}}</ref> The cover art was designed by Cliff Spohn.<ref name="Lapetino" />

According to a 1978 ''[[New York Times]]'' interview with [[Nolan Bushnell]], the engineer who was first assigned to develop the game didn't know the rules of the sport of baseball. As a result, in an initial version of the game if the player failed to hit the ball they were awarded a ball rather than a strike.<ref name="Klemesrud">{{cite news |last1=Klemesrud |first1=Judy |title=Bang!

A television advertising campaign for the game (and the Atari VCS as a whole) was fronted by [[Pete Rose]].<ref name="Murphy">{{cite book |last1=Murphy |first1=Sheila |title=How Television Invented New Media |date=2011 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813550947 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mHsq2_s8qEC&dq=%22Pete+Rose%22+%22Atari%22+%22home+run%22&pg=PA56 |access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref>
The game was one of the games used in advertisements by console competitor Mattel to show the quality improvement of [[Intellivision]] sports games over the Atari VCS.

==Reception==
A review in the December 1982 issue of ''JoyStik'' magazine was heavily critical of the game, stating that it was "nothing like real baseball", and describing the graphics as "primitive".<ref name="Joystik">{{cite news |title=Home Run |url=https://archive.org/details/joystik_magazine-1982-12/page/n63/mode/2up |access-date=21 February 2021 |work=Joystik Magazine |issue=3 |date=December 1982 |page=62}}</ref> The 1984 Software Encyclopedia published by ''[[Electronic Games]]'' magazine was similarly critical of the game, saying that it lacks "the "feel" of real sports action", and giving it an overall rating of 4/10.<ref name="1984 Software Encyclopedia">{{cite news |title=Home Run |url=https://archive.org/details/1984_Software_Encyclopedia_Number_2_1983_Reese_Communications_US/page/n91/mode/2up?q=real+sports |access-date=23 February 2021 |work=1984 Software Encyclopedia |year=1984 |page=93}}</ref> Writing in ''The Player's Strategy Guide to Atari VCS Home Video Games'', ''Electronic Games'' editors Arnie Katz and [[Bill Kunkel (journalist)|Bill Kunkel]] called the game, "so pared down from the original sport that it only barely qualifies as a baseball simulation," stating that, "it might more accurately be called 'Video Stickball'."<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Arnie|url=https://archive.org/details/book_players_strategy_guide/page/n27/mode/2up?view=theater|title=The Player's Strategy Guide to Atari VCS Home Video Games|last2=Kunkel|first2=Bill|author-link2=Bill Kunkel (journalist)|publisher=Dell Publishing, Reese Publishing|year=1982|isbn=0-440-17058-3|location=New York|pages=34, 124–129}}</ref>

A December 2000 review by Patrick Wong in ''Classic Gamer'' magazine panned the game, describing it as (together with Atari's ''[[Golf (Atari 2600)|Golf]]'') "two of the worst games ever made". Wong criticised the "boring" graphics, the small number of fielders deployable in the game, and the unrealistic gameplay, and summed the game up by saying "Gamers looking for a real baseball experience will have to look elsewhere".<ref name="Wong">{{cite news |last1=Wong |first1=Patrick |title=Atari's misplays and bogeys |url=https://archive.org/details/Classic_Gamer_Magazine_Volume_1_Issue_5_2000-09_Classic_Gamer_US/page/n57/mode/2up?q=%22Realsports+series%22 |access-date=4 March 2021 |work=Classic Gamer |issue=5 |date=December 2000 |page=58}}</ref> A review in the January/February 2003 issue of ''Digital Press'' was overwhelmingly negative, describing it as "a big stinker", "one of the worst games ever designed" with graphics that are "inexcusably bad".<ref name="Boy">{{cite news |last1=Boy |first1=Bat |title=Random Reviews: Home Run |url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/newsletters/digitalpress/dp50.pdf |access-date=24 February 2021 |work=Digital Press |issue=50 |date=January–February 2003 |page=16}}</ref> Bret Weiss writing in ''Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide'' praised the variety of the options for pitching but found the graphics and gameplay lack-lustre.<ref name="Weiss" /> Kieren Hawken writing in ''The A–Z of Atari 2600 Games: Volume 2'' criticised the excessively basic game-play and graphics and compared it negatively to later baseball games developed for the Atari 2600 where the developers had better utilised the platform's resources.<ref name="Hawken" />

==Legacy==
In an aggressive marketing campaign by Mattel Electronics, the game was compared to its graphically and gameplay-wise more advanced [[Intellivision]] counterpart ''[[Baseball (Intellivision video game)|Major League Baseball]]'', sparking off the first [[console war]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2007/06/gallery-game-history/ |title=Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming |access-date=2 March 2021 |date=15 June 2007 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref>
