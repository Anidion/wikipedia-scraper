'''''The Cottage''''' ({{lang-sv|Stugan}}) is an [[adventure game|adventure video game]] that was initially made available in 1978 for the [[DEC-10]] [[mainframe computer]] Oden in Stockholm, and later published by [[Scandinavian PC Systems]] for [[IBM PC]]s in 1986 in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and English. It was the first publicly available Swedish adventure game and one of the first commercial Swedish video games.

The game is set in a cottage in [[Småland]], Sweden; the player explores the cottage and its surroundings by typing simple commands to indicate what they want to do or where they want to go. They aim to find items and perform certain actions to raise their score and rank, while avoiding traps and enemy characters, with the ultimate goal of getting inducted into the cottage council.

The game was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Viggo Kann, Kimmo Eriksson and Olle Johansson, three children who had played the game ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' and wanted to create a similar game in Swedish. ''The Cottage'' began as a collection of smaller games the three had previously developed on their own, with the player moving through an [[amusement arcade]] to choose what to play; as they found it more fun to move through the arcade than to play the games, they ended up expanding the area to explore and removing most of the smaller games. Several thousand copies of the IBM PC release were sold; despite this, the developers did not receive much money from it outside of pre-paid royalties. The game had a cult-like status among Oden users at the time, and was commercially important to the computer center in Stockholm.

== Development ==
[[File:TI Silent 700 with phone.jpg|thumb|''The Cottage'' was mainly programmed on a [[Silent 700|Texas Silent Writer]] [[computer terminal]].|alt=A photo of a Texas Silent Writer computer terminal with a blue telephone attached.]]

''The Cottage'' was originally developed in 1977–1978 by three children: brothers Viggo Kann (then Eriksson) and Kimmo Eriksson, and their friend Olle Johansson, who at the time of the project's start were ten, twelve and fourteen years old, respectively.<ref name="jp renässans"/><ref name="vg around world"/> As Viggo and Kimmo's parents worked at Stockholms Datamaskincentral ("Stockholm's Computer Center", QZ) and the [[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], and Johansson's father worked at an office that was a client for QZ, they had access to QZ's [[DEC-10]] [[mainframe computer]] Oden.<ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/115-thord-nilsson.pdf |page=9 |title=Från matematikmaskin till IT |language=sv |trans-title=From data processing machine to IT |author=Lindgren, Sofia |date=2008-12-10 |publisher=[[Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology]] |access-date=2017-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830185656/https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/115-thord-nilsson.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-30 |url-status=live}}</ref> Using Oden and the book ''What to Do After You Hit Return'' (1975), the Eriksson brothers and Johansson learned [[Computer programming|programming]].<ref name="jp renässans">{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.se/article/renassans-for-stugan/ |title=Renässans för Stugan |trans-title=Renaissance for The Cottage |author=Nurbo, Sigrid |date=2013-11-12 |website=[[Jönköpings-Posten]] |publisher=Hallpressen |language=sv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511020954/http://www.jp.se/article/renassans-for-stugan/ |archive-date=2016-05-11 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/>

With the help from system developers at QZ, the three set up their game – at the time just titled ''Stuga'' ("Cottage") – on Oden in 1978,<ref name="sv utveckling 60-95">{{cite book |author=Ernkvist, Mirko |date=2008 |pages=3; 27–37 |title=Svensk dataspelsutveckling, 1960-1995 : transkript av ett vittnesseminarium vid Tekniska museet i Stockholm den 12 december 2007 |trans-title=Swedish video game development, 1960-1995: transcript of a witness seminar at the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm on December 12, 2007 |language=sv |url=https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:113912/FULLTEXT01.pdf |url-status=live |publisher=[[Royal Institute of Technology]] |isbn=978-91-7415-057-5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511142039/https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:113912/FULLTEXT01.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-11}}</ref> and created the message board ''Thorvalds stugråd'' ("Thorvald's cottage council") for it;<ref name="jp renässans"/><ref name="uppochner"/> scientists working at QZ played the game, and were able to discuss it on the message board.<ref name="jp renässans"/> The developers participated in the discussions, and used the message board to find information about [[software bug|bugs]] in the game.<ref name="internetmuseum"/> The Eriksson brothers and Johansson used a single [[Silent 700|Texas Silent Writer]] [[computer terminal]] in the Erikssons' parents' bedroom to program the game, through which they could log into Oden.<ref name="jp renässans"/><ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/> Connecting to Oden was expensive, so they sometimes visited KTH during the evening to work on the game, as Oden only cost money to use during the day. At KTH, they had access to one terminal each, which used actual monitors to display text, as opposed to their writer terminal at home which printed the text on "enormous amounts of paper".<ref name="jp renässans"/><ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/>

All three had previously programmed their own video games: Johansson had made a ''[[Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]]'' game featuring an opponent character named Thorvald;<ref name="uppochner"/> Kimmo had made a [[slot machine]] game and a [[tic-tac-toe]] game;<ref name="uppochner"/><ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/> and Kann had made a [[guessing game]] similar to [[Hangman (game)|hangman]]. They thought about how they wanted to combine their games into one single [[amusement arcade]]-themed game, where the player could pick which of the games they wanted to play, but due to difficulties in unifying the three developers' different programming methods, the game's code became "messy"; Kann eventually decided to make a "final push" and managed to finish and unify the program.<ref name="uppochner"/>

When they had finished programming and connecting the arcade, they realized that it was more fun to walk around in the arcade than to actually play the games. They ended up creating more and more rooms in the arcade, with characters to play games with, but as the arcade area and its surroundings grew, they eventually decided to remove the arcade games.<ref name="uppochner"/><ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/> Instead, they added new elements, including "shady characters", animals and items; the elements that remained from the arcade were the slot machine and the character Thorvald.<ref name="uppochner"/> Due to frequent discussions at the Thorvalds stugråd message board asking whether various aspects of the game were intended or not, the developers added an animal character that yells "Help, I don't know if I'm a bug or a feature!"{{efn|{{lang-sv|"Hjälp, jag vet inte om jag är en bug eller en feature!"}}}} before running into the water and disappearing.<ref name="internetmuseum"/>

Having played ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' (1976) on Oden and finding its cave exploration exciting, they wondered if they would be able to create a similar game in Swedish.<ref name="jp renässans"/> As they worked on the game, they grew into different roles: Kimmo mostly came up with "wacky ideas", Johansson was a driven visionary who "made things happen", and Kann fixed things and made sure that everything worked. According to Kimmo and Johansson, they cared about the game's content, not just the technical aspects, and made a game that they found fun themselves. They created two reoccurring characters based on themselves, who appear throughout the game: Kimmo, based on the real Kimmo, and the "cottage council chairman" Thorvald, who represents Johansson. As Kann was interested in language, and had specific ideas of how to spell certain words, they used consistently correct grammar, while consistently using non-standard but phonetic spelling for words such as "sig" ("oneself") and "dem" ("them"), rendering them as "sej" and "dom".<ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/>

The Eriksson brothers and Johansson used the [[programming language]] [[BASIC]] to create the game,<ref name="vg around world"/> which Kimmo called noteworthy: it was considered impossible to write big programs in BASIC, and ''The Cottage'' was "gigantic". The reason for their choice in programming language was that it was the only one all three knew beforehand; Kimmo said that they would no longer have chosen BASIC if they had programmed ''The Cottage'' in 1986, as they had access to many more programming languages by that time. According to Johansson, another reason was "pure defiance" towards the Eriksson brothers' father, who had told them they would never be able to get the game running if they programmed it in BASIC. Johansson said that the most challenging aspect of the development was getting the game to understand the Swedish language; to keep the size of the game's [[Parsing#Computer languages|command interpreter]] "reasonable", they decided to limit it to two-word commands. Acknowledging that different people use different words for things, they [[play-test]]ed it with friends and family, writing down all attempted commands and deciding what the game should be expected to understand.<ref name="uppochner"/> During a short period of the game's development, the developers also logged all actions players at QZ had taken that the command interpreter had not understood; based on this data, they improved the interpreter and changed the outcomes to certain actions.<ref name="uppochner"/><ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/> At one point, the Eriksson brothers and Johansson took a two-year break from the game, but eventually returned to it and finished it in 1979.<ref name="uppochner"/><ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/> At this point, the only ways to play the game were by using a computer terminal in a university or by connecting to Oden via a [[modem]].<ref name="internetmuseum"/>

=== Home release ===
[[File:Erik Fichtelius 2015-07-03 001.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|The publisher learned of the game through journalist Erik Fichtelius (pictured in 2015).|alt=A 2015 photograph of Swedish journalist Erik Fichtelius]]

The Eriksson brothers and Johansson did not work much more on the game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline [[Linjeflyg]]'s magazine ''Upp&Ner'', which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985.<ref name="jp renässans"/><ref name="uppochner"/><ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/> Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and that they would have to find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a [[personal computer|PC]] version.<ref name="uppochner"/>

The business software publisher [[Scandinavian PC Systems]]{{efn|Scandinavian PC Systems later changed their name to Visma Spcs.<ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/>}} found out about the game through ''Upp&Ner''; they were expanding at the time and wanted to add a video game to their catalogue, so they contacted the game's developers.<ref name="jp renässans"/><ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/> The Eriksson brothers and Johansson developed a version for home computers,<ref name="vg around world">{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Mark J.

Due to copyright issues, a scene in the mainframe version of the game where the player guest stars in ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' had to be cut for the commercial release, but all other materials remained intact; additionally, some visuals and audio were created and added for this release.<ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/> The game was published by Scandinavian PC Systems for [[IBM PC]]s in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and English in 1986.<ref name="vg around world"/><ref name="digitala drömmar"/> The developers negotiated with Scandinavian PC Systems, and were given 5 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] per sold copy of the Swedish version and 2 SEK per sold foreign copy as royalties; 30,000 SEK of the royalties were pre-paid.<ref name="sv utveckling 60-95"/>

Clas Kristiansson of ''Svenska Hemdator Hacking'' was positive to the game in a 1987 review, saying that it despite an "unexciting and unoriginal" setting had a pleasant atmosphere, citing creature dialogue and cryptic elements such as labyrinths and elevators as contributing factors. He criticized the indoors movement system, calling it unnecessarily complex to have two sets of commands for movement depending on where the player is and illogical to enter commands for walking backwards to go in that direction.<ref name="hemdator hacking">{{cite magazine |last=Kristiansson |first=Clas |date=1987 |title=Stugan |trans-title=The Cottage |page=26 |language=sv |magazine=Svenska Hemdator Hacking |issue=1987–3 |publisher=Selda Media}}</ref>

In his book ''Video Games Around the World'', author Mark J.P. Wolf called the game an "impressive achievement" considering the developers' young age.<ref name="vg around world"/> Internetstiftelsen i Sverige, the organization responsible for the Swedish [[top-level domain]] [[.se]], described the game as "legendary", and "an iconic name within the gaming community".<ref name="internetmuseum">{{cite web |url=http://www.internetmuseum.se/tidslinjen/thorvalds-stugrad/ |title=Barnatrio skapar legendariska Stugan |language=sv |trans-title=Trio of children creates the legendary The Cottage |website=Internetmuseum |publisher=Internetstiftelsen i Sverige |access-date=2017-03-06 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170306192823/http://www.internetmuseum.se/tidslinjen/thorvalds-stugrad/ |archive-date=2017-03-06 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kristiansson called the decision to create an adventure game in Swedish commendable, and thought it could help counteract the IBM PC's stigma as not being a computer for average people in Sweden.<ref name="hemdator hacking"/> Sigrid Nurbo at ''[[Jönköpings-Posten]]'' noted the game's absence from the 2013 video game exhibit at the [[Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology]] as odd considering its popularity and cult status.<ref name="jp renässans"/>
