'''''Mystery Mansion''''' is the name of a [[text adventure]] written in 1978â€“1981 by Bill Wolpert while at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Keyport, Washington. It originally ran only on the [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] HP-1000 minicomputer on the RTE (Real Time Executive) operating system, but was later ported by persons unknown to run under MPE (Multiprocessing Executive) on the HP-3000. Although the development dates make it contemporaneous with other seminal interactive fiction games such as ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' and ''Dungeon'' (which went on to become the ''[[Zork]]'' series from Infocom), it remains relatively unknown due to the specialized computers and operating systems on which it ran.

==Plot==
The object of the single-player game is to find one's way through a run-down, foreboding [[mansion]] in order to find various treasures, solve a murder, and avoid getting "killed" in the process all before the mansion is destroyed by fire at [[midnight]] to end the game. In addition to the 3 rooms x 3 rooms x 3 stories cube-shaped mansion, there are gardens, tunnels, nefarious characters, and other obstacles to make one's way through or around.

==Ports==
Two C-language ports exist, one by James Garnett while a graduate student at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], and another by Bob Sorem of the [[University of Minnesota]]. The former is a line-by-line exact port in K&R-style C that runs on most Unix-flavor operating systems, while the latter is an adaptation with features not in Wolpert's original in Borland C that runs only under MS-DOS/Windows.
