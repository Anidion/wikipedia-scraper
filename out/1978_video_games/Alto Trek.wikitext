==Gameplay==

''Alto Trek'' is a multiplayer game where each player uses their own Alto workstation to control a starship. The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy without being destroyed. A player can choose between being a [[Klingon]], [[Romulan]], or [[Starfleet|Terran]]. The game can be played by one player, but there will be no enemy to destroy.

There is no central server that maintains the game state. Each Alto "[[multicast]]s" its game information on the shared Ethernet that all players must be on. The "multicast" address on which to rendezvous is a function of the number of stellar systems in the game.

==Development==
The manual for version 2.1 is dated August 1979 and authored by Allen Wells, Bob Baldwin, and Steve Quarterman. It confirms that the game was authored primarily by Ball.

Around 1997, while a vice president at [[Microsoft]], Rashid began to re-implement the game as a way to teach himself to use the [[DirectX]] programming [[Application Programming Interface|API]]. This resulted in the development of ''[[Allegiance (computer game)|Microsoft Allegiance]]''.<ref name="devjo1">{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/075/075281p1.html |title=Developer Journal: Allegiance, Chapter 1 |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=February 16, 2000 |accessdate=2008-03-04 |archive-date=2011-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831202529/http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/075/075281p1.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
